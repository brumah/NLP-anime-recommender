    "Fairy Tail": [
        "In the Manga/ Anime industry, the three biggest franchises are Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. They are know as the 'big three'. If there were a 'big four' the fourth would probably be Fairy Tail, an equally long running series of epic battles, juicy laughs, and exceptional art and design.Fairy Tale is set in a world resembling the southern European Renaissance in all it's architectural glory, but the people dress as if they come from every corner of the world. There are times when the show looks like a giant cosplay convention. Fairy tale it self is the name of the wizards guild whose members are the principle cast of the story.The first season is told mostly from the point of view of Fairytail's newest addition. Lucy Heartfilia is a seventeen year old, peppy and ambitious. She has run away from home (and her snobby father with his snobby estate) to follow her drew of being a wizard. Her magic specialty is summoning celestial spirits of the zodiac; All of whom are contemporary comic book versions of their mythological counterparts. Sagitarious for example is a man in a horse costume.As the seasons go on, The members of fairy tail endure various quests or expeditions, and must face of against many foes, including other wizard guilds. The recurring gimmick is that each season ends with an enemy becoming a friend and joining Fairy Tail, so the cast gets bigger and bigger, but it retains a focus on the select few that were there to begin with.Perhaps the main difference between this series and the 'big three' is that Fairy Tail is not a show with overarching narrative direction. It is not a story about a protagonist on a journey to achieve an ultimate title. Lucy achieves her goal in episode one and from there she goes where the show takes her. The character of Natsu who brings her into Fairy Tail, is the one who is marketed and recognized as the protagonist because he fits the criteria of the young boys (shounen) genre to which Fairy Tail (and the big 3) belong. Natsu represents, physical strength, juvenile Bliss, a big appetite, and the themes of comradely. Like Luffy and the younger Naruto, Natsu is just a really big kid. He is a lot of fun, but unlike Lucy, we don't get a good look into his heart. The show just asks us to accept that he has one by giving him monologues of phony sincerity and insight which his character type is too immature to be capable of summoning. He does have a personal quest however, which is to find this 'foster father', the dragon known as Igneel who raised him as a child and gave him his fire magic, and there is a touching episode in the most recent season where this pays off. Yet the emotional impact is still underwhelming because Natsu's motive is never really part of the character, it is merely a side note. This makes him a harder character to invest in as a protagonist than say Luffy of One Piece or Naruto Uzumaki.Fairy Tale's show stealer, is one of the best manga/anime characters to date. Erza Scarlett, is the queen of Fairy Tale Wizards. Her personalty and powers are as attractive as her name is repulsive. Erza comes from a dark place, having escaped child slavery. Her magic is swordsmanship coupled which her dozen suits of armour which she can swap in and out of live a video game character. She has cunning and disciplined, and as a fighter she is dazzling to watch. Yet she is also amusing because she shares the same soft soft for spas, cake and pretty dresses as the next girl, while maintaining her conservative appearance.Dramatically, Fairy Tail is a hit and miss show. There are times when it flat out fails through the classic mistake of telling and not showing what the characters feel. Every now and then it does surprise you in it's ability to channel thoughtful emotion but realistic human emotions are few and far between in the show, and the scenes that should be intimate turn usually turn out rather more bombastic. What it is missing most is the feeling mystique that can absorb you completely into the anime world. It needs more quiet scenes and fewer loud ones. Fairy Tail succeeds most on the grounds of action comedy. Interwieving slapstick comedy with visually intoxicating scenes of action and peril, and a strong, celtic-tinted score Fairy Tail manages to build momentum from season to season. I would have preferred less dialog during the action scenes, but such a thing is inevitable in manga/anime. Even when the writing slow the show down, the picture keeps it moving.",
        "I understand that some anime lines are extremely popular (Pokemon, Dragonball, Transformers and yes, Fairy Tail). But there's some anime I like and some I don't. So this is more a personal subjective review rather than my generally-more-serious type review.I got literally 3 minutes into this and my impression was:* Lousy animation not even worth of Saturday morning cartoons, much less the anime genre* Awful theme song. Non-catchy, brash, poorly-written* Worst show intro I've seen in any anime, ever. It just screams, \"Amateur tripe follows!\"* Hyperactive to the extremeDoes it have a good story? Does it get better? Do the characters shine? Those first three minutes might cause a person to not care about checking it out further. In truth I shut it down at that point and decided to watch no more. But later I was a little bored so decided to give it a fair chance. I lasted about 4 more episodes and concluded my initial impression was correct. It remained silly, excessively hyperactive, and unimpressive.So not my favorite anime by a long shot. Compared to anime such as RWBY or Sword Art Online it doesn't hold a candle. But some folks might find it enjoyable. (As a note: I don't like Pokemon, Dragonball or Transformers at all... so giving this 5 stars is pretty generous from me). ; )",
        "Fairy Tail is a series that you'll either love or hate. But this is a mediocre series as it's still enjoyable despite its flaws. After hearing about the popularity for the series shooting up and how everyone was talking about it and how good it was, I decided to give it a try. I was a bit worried as some people have also gave it negative reviews and I felt entertained by it but it was so annoying that I wanted to stop!Little Lucy is a celestial wizard who wants to join the Fairy Tail guild. After being tricked by an impostor in episode 1, she finally gets to meet Marijane, one of her idols and the guild was starting in a big fight, including taking someone's underwear!I was so excited that I was hooked to the series until episode 3, I think I see where the series was going, to be the same tired clich\u00e9 with Lucy being the crybaby who isn't even strong enough to TRY to fight back her problems for a change unless she gets help! Natsu and Happy are both obnoxious characters, even Happy is too talkative for me.Lucy is probably the best character in Fairy Tail, but was loud, passive, and saccharine. But since I now see where the series is trying to go with her character, I found myself not caring much for her, I mean, she practically cries every episode and it becomes insufferable pretty fast!There could've been some more serious fights with this anime instead of going for a series for all the easily impressed kids to get entertained by. Bad animation.5/10 Too bad. I hope next series will be better.",
        "My 3/10 mangaupdates review for the whole series as of the writing. The anime is identical with a high among of filler.: I tried the series once when it was new, judged it as an attempt to rip off One Piece and moved on but i picked up our volumes on a slow day at my library job because i heard some crazy things on the web and flipped through the series again. What i saw was unoriginality to the max, tasteless ecchi (with a scene of sexualized torture standing out), no real stakes or world logic and borderline plagiarism. Is Kodansha trying to troll Shueisha here as i saw Franky and the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So the only difference to One Piece is that the Fairy Tail constantly throws it's female leads under the bus, lacks any tone and now managed to rack up about 10 (!?!) spin-offs. Two points off and zero interest on my side remains. Read the recent Blind Faith Descent (9/10) for a good and rather dark adventure series with a comparable setting or SJ's stuff. They at least have a proved formula.",
        "5.8This anime is a tough one for me to give a score, because it really just isn't my style, and that has affected my perception of it. I have a huge personal issue with the sloppy fantasy, especially a lazy magic system, and Fairy Tail, with oblivious prid, sports one of the laziest magic systems I've ever struggled to understand. This anime is not a failure, but I find it fails in many respects. My main gripe with this anime is it's use of idiocy and lawless, reasonless magic as a cheap plot device. I can't count how many times I almost put this series down and walked away because an incredibly contrived but tense plot came to a resolution at the hands of some magical something or other that came out of left field and had no explanation. It was frustrating. I wouldn't even call Fairy Tail's magic system soft, but rather a volatile liquid. Gaseous might be an even better descriptor. However, the anime does have a very unique charm, driven home with a stubborn theme of friendship through all. The folk-rock score adds to this charm quite well, without feeling overly cheesy. Every other aspect of this series-animation, art style, dialogue, etc.-is frankly only worthy of a passing grade.If I may linger, I dislike how this anime refuses to kill anybody we would actually care about, and yet still has death scenes because they're fun. They have a whole death scene: every character expresses their grief, they run the happy memories montage, and then the character(s) who was supposed to die will just be miraculously A-okay, or whisked away by some magical whatever, without proper reason. They add new characters so damn fast, yet refuse to get rid of old ones.",
        "Magic and Guilds , Cute Fairies and shenanigans Classic action adventure comedy about the trials of friendship and making end's meet obtaining their bounties -- the best feel-good series on this list10/10",
        "Fairy Tail generally has a vibe of positivity and joy. If you like cool looking characters, sheer power dominating their enemies, trusting their friends and protecting each other, if you like good animations with awesome soundtracks mixed perfectly with every scene, you should watch this show and I am sure you will enjoy it very much.Fairy Tail Series 2: This direct sequel has more or less the same elements and aspects as the previous one. Just more \"boom\" and more questions answered for some characters' unknown pasts.Fairy Tail Final Series: It's nothing more than a huge send-off to the series as it just ties everything together from 10 years of Fairy Tail anime, sure in a bit of a shaky way, especially considering the power kicks in from time to time. Fairy Tail embodies again and again, engulfing everything.",
        "I really don't know how best to write this...I just binged on the first 48 episodes thanks to Netflix. Fairy Tail is the story of a wizard guild set in a World a lot like ours. It begins with Lucy, a young user of celestial magic who wants to join the Fairy Tail guild. After meeting Natsu, she is inducted into the guild and meets (amongst others); Gray, Erza, Loke, Elfman, Mira, Cana. What follows is the relationships, surprises and histories of majority of these characters.The show essentially, after the first few episodes of meeting everyone, follows the same patter; the team accept a mission, they meet some impossibly hard foe, the foe has henchmen, the minor characters defeat the henchmen and are rendered incapable, Natsu defeats the big bad (sometimes with help/ encouragement from others). In amongst the fighting, or just before/after, we'll be introduced to the next big bad, or it will be hinted at, and then we'll have a nice reprieve before it all begins again. So, due to this, the character development can be a bit lousy - the only 'development' I remember is Elfman and his history with Lisanna which builds to the unleashing of Mira's true powers in the penultimate episode. We never see the characters training, they usually just get better when they need to. Lucy's celestial guardians seem kind of lame when we first meet them all (Taurus looses against a monkey) but then they just keep getting better because the enemies just keep getting (apparently) harder. Natsu always seems to fight like someone who's never been in a fight when he first encounters a bad guy but then, after being pummelled (and after a reminder of the true strength that lies within him from Erza or Gray or Makarov or Gajeel or Happy) rises up and, using the same technique that just had his butt handed to him, wins. Then there's the illicit details of how the magic is working. I mean, really, I can't be bothered to here for the umpteenth time how that magic spell will obliterate everything in its path. I can figure out why Natsu is shooting flames out his feet to act like a jet and penetrate a forcefield, thank you very much... is this a Japanese thing? The need to be so heavy with exposition?Add to that the very confusing dialogue (I watched with subtitles) which never seems grammatically correct and you're sometimes confused as to how Erza's armour just happens to be the right combination... and how did Gray just? Oh never mind.Because this show is awesome.Seriously.The magic and action sequences are always a lot of fun and very high energy. Some of the magic abilities are really cool (one summons a demon that tears its way into our reality, that one was spooky). Even if they do talk so much. My favourite is probably Juvia (as in Lluvia, the Spanish for rain). She's an elemental, or so they say, and has complete control over water. She can create it, manipulate it, transform into it... some of my favourite fight scenes involve her, so it's always a shame when she gets knocked out or incapacitated before even getting started. The animation is some of the coolest I've ever seen. I love the character and the magic, not to mention the scenery and moods that the animators create.Then there's the soundtrack, if only they put the same energy into the writing as they did the soundtrack! The score is just breathtaking. Hooks all over the place. Strings to make a grown man weep at just the right moment. It's very folksy and reminds me of the Game of Thrones theme tune. Perhaps the person who wrote for GoT got the inspiration from Fairy Tail?The other awesome factor involves the characters. Although they're criminally underused at times, they are all different and all memorable. Each of them have strengths and weaknesses and quirks and, surprising for a serial cartoon (or any series for that matter), they're yet to become plot devices. They remain true to themselves throughout. The only issue I have is that, when one of them seemingly sacrifices themselves for the good of the guild (and it happens a lot), the awesome soundtrack kicks in and it seems like someone is about to bite the bullet. But then it turns out they were only knocked out... I mean, if you're gonna be knocked out, you probably don't need to make such a song and dance of it.So, despite some bad writing flaws and a fair bit of unoriginal writing, Fairy Tail is still one of my favourite animes. I'm constantly saying, \"just one more\" so they must be doing something right, right?",
        "I have watched Fairytail since the beginning, and after 300 episodes it has ended its last season ( as far as we know), I don't read the manga, but I know the story is still continuing with 100 years quest but this will be an analysis of the anime not the manga. I'm writing this review not because I hate this anime and want to keep other people from enjoying it, but because I really do care for it and I just wish it could have reached its full potential and have been something greater. If you don't know already this anime is about a guild of wizards called Fairytail that go on adventures, get into fights constantly, and do so much more.The Characters:\nThere is an entire universe of characters in this anime, even just in the fairy tail guild. But the main group consists of Natsu, Lucy, Gray, Juvia, Erza and Wendy. Each character from the main hero, Natsu to the main villain, Zeref are all likeable. Every character has a good design, that makes each one of them standout, even if their just background characters. However a lot of their personalities are exactly the same, especially the fairytail guild, each and everyone one of them just wants to do the right thing, have fun, and protect their guildmates no matter what, each character has a quirk or two but their all very similar. You do feel the emotional connection between them though, since they do convince you that they are a family and that is the real magic here.The Villains:\nLets just say you wont remember a single name of any of the villain bosses, its not to say you wont while watching that particular arc, but not one of them is very memorable. But when they are its because they converted to the good side, which is actually pretty common, which isn't a bad thing, if the redemption is done right, except some of the villains are complete homicidal maniacs, who become chill and kind after joining the good side, almost turning into different characters and are easily forgiven by the heroes. They even show flashbacks of tragic backstories to make you the audience forgive these villains and forget the very evil things that they just did (But then there are similar villains who are not worthy of redemption?) Hiro mashima builds these villains up pretty well, and tries to make them as OP as possible however since the heroes are more OP, the villains always end up losing in the exact same way.The Action:\nThe action in this anime goes from epic to bland. Despite there being amazing fights there is a whole sea of bland repetitive fights, its like there is so much fighting that your brain turns off for most of them. The reason why most of the fights become boring is because there are no stakes, you know that despite the characters screaming in pain that they will not be killed, that despite all the villains power, the heroes power is even greater. Which can make dragged out fights begin to feel pointless and repetitive. What could have made the fights more intense, Is if there was more deaths. I'm not saying any of the main characters should have died, but at least more of the pointless background characters should have, to increase the stakes of the situation or make the villain that more terrifying. Even when there is a death you will not believe that it is permanent, since so many other characters have survived worse, which just makes the few actual deaths feel very random.The Music:\nLets just say this is my favorite part of the anime, the intro/outro songs are legendary. The background music during the action scenes and dramatic scenes, is just epic, I actually listen to the soundtrack all the time. My absolute favorite song is Fairy Tail - Tsuioku Mezameru Tamashii Ost. This soundtrack could be one of the best in all of anime.The Fanservice:\nThis is one of the main reasons to watch this anime, as shallow as that sounds, let me just say it will keep you watching. The amount of fanservice in this anime has become an in joke, and it serves as 50% of the comedy in this anime. Every single woman in this anime has the body of a goddess and every man has rock hard eight pack abs. The level of fanservice is sometimes so gratuitous (especially in the ovas) that it will leave you feeling uncomfortable but happy at the same time ( Don't lie to yourselves).The Romance:\nOkay I know this is a Shonen action anime, but I'm sure a million shippers will all agree with me, that many of the characters had the potential to become lovers based on their interactions alone. In fact im sure some characters were created just to be shipped together. Despite the romance not being central to the show, a lot of the time its focused on, to the point of trolling. Even some of the intro songs clearly show some couples acting like lovers, and that will make you want to pull your hair out. And unlike other anime where romance is nonexistent, this anime clearly acknowledges the existence of romance, but usually just with background characters. Which will make you angrily question why the creators didn't just go all the way, the main culprit of this, is the time when jellal and erza kissed. While a lot of characters have cute moments together they are still very vague, and I would say only a handful had truly meaningful relationships that I would even consider romantic. My main couples being Gray and Juvi, gajeel and levy and mavis and zeref.The Magic:\nThe power scale in this anime is garbage, every time you think you have an understanding of exactly how powerful someone is, its ruined by a new source of untapped power that makes the main heroes even more OP. Which is honestly the only way they are able to defeat their villains half the time, without requiring any major onscreen training, they just magically already have a new power. However every type of magic in this anime is creative and interesting to watch being used. There's no way to really describe the awful power system in this anime, basically you should always assume that the main heroes will always overpower any threat with the pure power of friendship. And yes that is an actual superpower in this anime. They try to show you that the heroes can get hurt, but make quick recoveries from what should have been a life ending attack, this just makes you feel like every fight is just white noise until that final attack.The Emotion:\nLet me just say this is what will make you a fan of this show, this anime is an emotional rollercoaster that will make you feel invested in the main characters. The music helps tremendously, but due to the length of this anime you will come to appreciate or even love the characters so much that you might start cheering when they make a triumphant speech or last stand. The dramatic scenes are surprisingly very effective, and when the characters cry you might get a little teary eyed yourself. Sadly it sometimes feels artificial and manipulative, especially with that damn good music, there are a few \"almost\" deaths in this anime ( yes there are a lot) that will make you consider that your favorite character might actually die, only to be prevented at the last second or be totally retconned, which in my opinion weakens the anime, since you see this trick done so many times that you come to the conclusion that no one will ever really die or stay dead. This really does keep the anime from having any real depth or sense of loss, which is credited to the creator hiro mashima hating the idea of death and wanting to cherish life, which I deeply respect but its not effective for a story especially one as long as this one.The Finale:\nThe final season was something I was really looking forward too, since it would be a war arc, and it would be time for the fairytail guild to fight the 2 most powerful villains in the anime, that being Zeref and Acknologia. I thought all the previous problems I had with this anime would be fixed here and provide a satisfying conclusion. Sadly It didn't, in fact it might have expanded upon them, although the war was interesting to watch, it dragged out far too long with no causalities and just a ton of cop out deaths that were just meant to pull at your heart strings. While there were many epic moments, it was far too convoluted and lacked any sense of dread. However the final fights with zeref and acknologia were interesting to say the least and provided satisfying ends to the villains. Also there was an epilogue that does hint at possible romance finally being developed among the ships, but is not satisfying enough, the anime then ends on a cheerful note, with the main characters heading out on another adventure. This anime is not the masterpiece that many have claimed it to be, it has plot holes in the story, its emotionally manipulative, and lacks any real depth and stakes, which I feel are all the traits that if done right, could have made this one of the greatest anime ever. Despite its flaws, I still love watching it, it has a charm and sense of wholesomeness, not to mention familiarity that always make you happy to see the heroes win and being happy. There are some legitimate moments where you'll hear a grand corny speech ( a lot) about friendship and doing the right thing that will inspire you and leave you feeling enlightened. The comedy in this anime is Gold. Although the entire show is not perfect there are some solids arcs that are a must watch, this includes the tower of heaven arc, the tenrou island arc, the grand magic games arc, the tartaros arc, the zero arc and the final arc.( trust me these are just a few of the entire anime series) Despite these being my favorite arcs of the anime, go ahead and watch any episode you want, im just saying not every single one is absolutely necessary to watch. Fairytail is not a perfect anime, but it is a feel good anime, that brought me a lot of joy in my life and I'll gladly watch it again now that its over. I hope this anime brings you some happiness as it did me, and may it inspire you as well, after all, this is a fairytale.",
        "This show is very fun and exciting, the fight scenes are incredible and epic. This has to be one of the best fantasy anime ever.",
        "This is the best fantasy anime I ever watch in my life .",
        "This anime is truly amazing epically the final season. It was wonderful",
        "Fairy Tail is just like the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. But it's much cooler in the Magical World of the Battles in the world of Anime, but it's nice and awesome. Nastu Dragneel is the best Fire Dragon Slayer Wizard ever in Fairy Tail. But I'am not going to give spoilers, just only the powers.",
        "It looked stupid seeing as it was on Netflix, but I took a chance, then thought it kind of had a FMA feel to it. I find out in the credits it was made by Gen Fukunaga. Many of the animes I love are made by him. Happy the cat reminded me of Puar on Dragon Ball series, except Happy can only fly, not turn into things. Instead of using Alchemy like FMA, Fairy Tail uses magic. It is a great show after all.",

For me I like zeref more than any other character. It's worth watching story . Stories similar to black clover, naruto one piece ...",
        "It started off slow for me but thank goodness I stuck with it. Wizards, adventures, a great story line....... I can't say enough about this series. I basically binge watched the whole series over a number of weeks.\nI was actually sad when i finished watching it. I can say for sure that this is one of the best anime series I have ever watched. I hope you enjoy the adventure as much as I did!",
        "I've watched through most of the Tartaros arc, and I must say, I love Fairy Tail. These characters are wonderful. The music is incredible. And who doesn't love watching Natsu beat down evil yet again against all odds?That said, there are some issues people who tell you you shouldn't watch Fairy Tail always bring up. So let's take a look at a few.1. The power of friendship wins every time. People complain that Fairy Tail is all about the power of friendship and it wins every battle, which can get old. But they're missing something. Fairy Tail isn't about friends. Fairy Tail is about orphans who have found a family. And yes, the power of a family is pretty strong.2. Repetitive fights. To each his own. I love the fights, especially Natsu's.3. Sexualization and fan service. Yeah, they're right about this one. There's no excuse for the amount of nudity, giant boobs, bath scenes and downright sadism in this show. Torture is usually combined with half-naked or naked protagonists. So I can understand why many parents wouldn't want their kids to watch this. That said, learn to avert your eyes or fast forward. This show still has a lot to offer. Still, I took two stars off for this alone.4. Bad or annoying humor. Again, this depends on your personal preferences. The humor generally isn't all that objectionable, and it's often quite funny. Still, I took a star off for the more stupid \"humorous\" parts.All told, Fairy Tail may or may not be right for you. But if you don't mind looking away or fast forwarding at some of the more sadistic scenes and you enjoy good characters who genuinely care about each other, plus a generally upbeat and cheerful feel, you'll enjoy it just fine.",
        "Terrible story where most enemies fall to simple logic or \"being in love\".I think this is on the border of Hentai, an example is that the female characters, always end up I stripper poses, seen from behind, with a way to detailed crotch. Really repulsive and a clear sign the author/ cartoonist did not believe in his own writing skills.",
        "I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ANIME AAAAA-\nMASTERPIECE",
        "This show is extremely childish. It lacks character depth, plot, logical occurrence of events and a logical character decisions. Top it all with pretty girls with big boobs and perverted men. The animation isn't very pretty and every emotion is exaggerated (yes, even for anime). It's like watching a madhouse. I got to episode five then gave up.",
        "I grew up watching this show and my god every arc was a rollcoster of comedy, character development, emotions and just flat out anticipation for each episode I highly recommend if you love adventure anime's with lots of interesting and funny characters.",
        "This series is really worth you time . You will sure love it . Fairy tail guild is a family filled with caring members . I wish I could get in that fantasy world. Superb series . I started to love it from the very beginning. Don't worry about it's running time . Just watch it.",
        "I'm reading the manga in sync with series. It really augments the art forms.The anime follows manga very closely. Faithful to story and art. Although the subscription to Crunchy Roll (fka Funimation). Is cheaper than close to $600 to Amazon for 6 boxed sets.",
        "Fairy Tail is one of my favorite long-running shows for many reasons. One, the action is good and well detailed, the comedy is hilarious and used at the right times, and it's eye-opening discussions make you love the characters even more. Every time I watched an episode, I would have many different reactions to them. Sometimes I'll be, 'oh that was good', or 'what the hell did I just watch', or 'that was freaking intense!', or 'that was depressing' and... you get the point. My point is that this series will leave you with many different emotions as you walk away from it. Some may say it is over the top when it comes to the humor or the action, but still, it sticks to the story and it doesn't care if anything is over the top. Some people may not like this series for a multitude of reasons. The only problem I personally had with it, was how long the series goes. I am not a huge fan of long-running animes because of filler episodes, or it drags on sometimes, but that is just me. Another thing I'd like to point out, is this is an anime that is not meant to be watched seriously. At all. There are many serious moments when it comes to death, loneliness, or family, which I will point out makes the story even more interesting and will sometimes leave you with a new perspective on the little things around you. This anime series is meant to be watched solely for entertainment. The emotional parts and situations will definitely get to you when they come, but for the most part, this is an anime that is just fun to watch simply for the heck of it. If you are a fan of long-running animes, love action, comedy, and stories of friendships and family, this action-anime is just for you."

    "Gintama": [
        "I just think its pretty clever and like most of the scenes were very funny. I like how this anime took the pee out of nearly every anime out there or even themselves. I love the scenes were they took the piss out of Dragon ball z, pokemon, naruto, one piece, yu gi oh and even Classroom Assassination. I also loved the scenes where Gin was sleeptalking thinking he was paralysed by a ghost, himself and some other character dislocated their arms so they get away with not carrying a coffin and when Gin & another guy were facing off like as if it was Street Fighter style but a lot dirtier (basically Gins opponent was showing off his junk). Although I wouldn't consider calling this one of the best clever anime Ive watched but I have so much respect for the show and you can laugh at it for just being so hilarious as it is! I'll give it 8/10!",
        "When it comes to comedy this show delivers just about the nastiest, funniest, and down right gritty series to date. Gintama, quite possibly the dumbest individual on the planet. But in all fairness his sight for the obvious can often leave you in stitches with endless laughter. The series takes place in old Edo where in iron town the populace is protected by just about anyone that has grown up there.However, with Gintama, and his oddball group doing odd jobs around the neighbourhood it's no wonder that nobody asks them for help. He is a samurai, one that delves in the old school way of wielding a sword although the alien groups that landed on earth forbids it at any cost. Now and then his posse must fight off the outcast aliens with every resource in their arsenal. That is with slapstick jibes, jokes, insults, and rather skanky girls dressed kimonos.Pair this up with an objective within his group they create scenarios for themselves, which often gets mixed up with other scenarios that leads to other scenarios, and so on... etc etc. Yet through all of their mishaps, and tongue tripping ideas they always manage to come out smelling like a rose.I found this series to be a kind meant for the low brow, low education, and nearly poor crowd. But it fits for the times of yesteryear struggles in Japan. Everyday conflicts with endless hierarchy misfits in the background watching their every move ready to strike back at the common folk who built the cities for the Shogun families. One needs to have a sense of humour to live or to die on their knees facing defeat.Gintama has it all... humour, laughs galore, great music... crude, and often gross conduct in certain montages of story telling. It also shapes the human condition with stories of sadness, and some tragedies, which befit some of the more colourful characters. Especially with Gintama, and his partners Shinpachi, and Kagura. Without them his way of life would be boring.I have to give this series ten stars for all of the ingredients put into it. If you have a day off, try and watch this funny, and fast paced show. You will not regret it. Highly recommended to those aged 14, and above. Not for minors.",
        "Rating: 4.9Favorite Episode: Sworn EnemyYou have to find the comedy style funny otherwise you'll loathe the series. Gintama is mostly parody humor with serious/semi-serious arcs interspersed throughout. Personally, I didn't find most of the episodes funny mainly due to Shinpachi's constant screaming, and whole episodes dedicated to parodying Japanese celebrities, games, or obscure anime I haven't seen. If you don't like the humor then all that's left is the serious arcs, which unfortunately are generic shonen arcs. The serious arcs are formulaic and almost all go like this: A new foe appears, Gin gets hurt by the foe, the foe wreaks havoc while Gin is hurt, Gin miraculously recovers and fights the foe, Gin gives his monologue centered around the themes of the arc, and beats the foe. Finally, the foe's full backstory is revealed and they were never evil just misunderstood. Most arcs are not resolved by strategy or clever writing, but rather plot armor, and incessant plot conveniences. There are too many instances to enumerate but for example: in the Yoshiwara flames arc, Gintoki fights Hosen the strongest of the Yato (a superhuman race), ever. Not only does he get beaten, but he also takes a blunt kick to the face from Hosen. Instead of dying as any human would, he just sits there for 2 minutes, steaming like a titan then miraculously revives and beats the crap out of Hosen with his as seen on tv wooden sword to save the day. It's nonsense especially when Kamui another Yato took off the arm of Abuto (also a Yato) in one swing, and Kamui is WEAKER than Hosen. Using that logic a mere human with no powers like Gintoki should be dead in one punch fighting Hosen. It was the plot armor of being the main character that allowed him to even survive the fight. There are so many moments that make your head spin like: Gintoki being able to fight against lightsabers with a wooden sword, shinpachi going toe-toe with Utsuro in the silver soul arc, Shinpachi not dying when fighting hordes of yato in the shogun assassination arc, Takasugi not dying after he was destroyed by Gintoki and impaled in the shogun assassination arc, Utsuro not immediately blowing up earth via Altana, but waiting for no reason until the odds were stacked against him, etc... There are even thematic issue's like the silver soul arc undoing Gintoki's character by having him run away from the present to save his teacher of the past, when thematically it was established Gintoki has moved on from the past, and has found new meaning in the present unlike his counterparts Takasugi, and Katsura (for a while). There are no stakes in this show since everyone important enough besides the shogun will survive no matter what happens, God forbid the MC gets injured for more than 2 episodes. You would expect decent writing from what some call a \"goated\" shonen. Besides the Shogun Assassination arc, and the Yagyu arc I thoroughly disliked this series. There are other problems with this series, but this is already my longest review yet.",
        "This show has so many episodes that are rated above 9....but imdb decided that the overall rating this tv show deserves is 8.6, that makes no sense at all. Just look at season 4s ratings, imdb.....dont be stupid...this tv show obviously deserves a way better rating than 8.6, honestly. This is not the only anime you guys have rated really low....attack on titan is another victim of this....imdb, just do the right thing, you guys know the truth and i believe i am not the only one who believes and thinks this way.",
        "Gintama, the long-running anime series based on Hideaki Sorachi's manga, stands out as a unique and hilarious comedy that blends humor, action, and heartfelt storytelling. With its witty writing, memorable characters, and diverse range of comedic styles, Gintama offers a refreshing and entertaining experience that keeps viewers hooked. While it may not be for everyone due to its episodic nature and occasional pacing issues, it earns a solid 8/10 rating for its consistent laughs and occasional moments of brilliance.One of the highlights of Gintama is its exceptional humor. The series masterfully combines clever wordplay, satirical references, and absurd situations to create a comedic atmosphere unlike any other. Whether it's poking fun at popular culture, breaking the fourth wall, or parodying well-known anime tropes, Gintama's humor hits the mark with remarkable consistency. The comedic timing and delivery are impeccable, leaving viewers in stitches and eagerly anticipating the next punchline.Another strength of Gintama lies in its diverse cast of characters. Protagonist Gintoki Sakata, a lazy samurai with a penchant for odd jobs, leads a motley crew of misfits and eccentric individuals. Each character brings their unique quirks and comedic traits, adding layers of hilarity and depth to the overall narrative. From the straight-faced Shinpachi to the overzealous Kagura and the lovable Sadaharu, the chemistry and interactions between the characters form the backbone of the series' comedic appeal.While Gintama is primarily a comedy, it also excels in delivering emotionally charged storylines. Amidst the humor, the series delves into themes of friendship, loyalty, and the struggle against injustice. Gintama is not afraid to explore darker and more poignant moments, providing a contrast to the lighthearted comedy. These occasional serious arcs showcase the series' ability to balance comedy with heartfelt storytelling, leaving a lasting impact on the viewers.The animation and art style in Gintama may not be the most visually stunning, but it effectively captures the essence of the series. The character designs are distinct and memorable, and the action sequences are well-animated, conveying the intensity and excitement of the battles. However, there are instances where the animation quality dips, particularly during filler episodes or less critical story arcs.One aspect that might be a double-edged sword for some viewers is the episodic nature of Gintama. While it allows for a wide range of comedic scenarios and parodies, it also leads to occasional pacing issues and uneven storytelling. Some episodes may feel disconnected or less engaging compared to others, making it difficult for the series to maintain a consistent level of quality throughout its extensive run. However, the gems scattered throughout the series more than make up for these occasional lulls.In conclusion, Gintama is a comedic gem that offers a refreshing and unconventional anime experience. With its clever humor, lovable characters, and occasional moments of genuine emotion, it has solidified its place as a fan-favorite comedy series. While the episodic nature and occasional pacing issues may be a drawback for some, the consistently hilarious writing and memorable comedic moments make Gintama a must-watch for fans of comedy anime. Strap in for a wild ride filled with laughter, heart, and the unexpected as Gintama takes you on an unforgettable comedic journey.",
        "I do not know who wrote this but they are literal geniuses. The Cadence and direction of this anime is anyone to guess, but when they want to be serious it's amazing, when it's funny I laughed my ass off, and when they want to get deep I have cried. I have definitely watched all the big Shonen and have been an anime fan for over 25 years. I am just getting in the middle of gintama. But I will finish it I have heard such great things and I can only agree. Anyone can watch it you your girlfriend doesn't matter it touches on all aspects of life.",
        "I don't know how I didn't find this gem sooner.This series is soo damn good. I am only at episode 100 right now and its already a really solid 9, probalby will be a 10 by the time i finsh it.It has an incredible cast, some of the best written characters i have ever seen. Gintoki could be my favourite protagonist ever.Everything about the series is so charming, the jokes allmost allways land. The only thing that drags it down to a 9 right now is the lack of \"serious\" arcs, but i heard it gets better later on.I don't know how this series is only rated a 8.7 right now. Probalby because some people dropped it really early on.I absolutely love it. One of my Top 5 anime for sure.",
        "Every anime has it's funny, even hilarious moments. But not many are built around these moments. Gintama, for the most part definitely is.This anime is completely insane. It's full of random hilarity and antics, while still maintaining a storyline (per episode and arcs). You don't even have to worry about fillers, because you won't know when they hit you, as there is no general plot. Plus, the fillers are just as funny and awesome as the other episodes, if not more. There are tons of references to anime and Japanese culture, which is kind of a down side for a person who isn't familiar with either or both. This reason also makes this anime almost impossible to dub and very hard to even sub! However, if you do get the jokes (and not all of them are reference related), you'll be in tears. It's not all just laughter though. There are definitely some heart touching, throat lump forming, beautiful moments in the anime too (though not as much).All I can say is, if you're an anime fan and haven't watched it, you're doing yourself a big crime by missing this one. As the title says, I not only class this as one of the greatest anime, or even one of the greatest TV shows, but one of the most brilliant pieces of entertainment mankind has ever created.",
        "Gintama is the typical show I love to watch on a good night after a days work and have a good laugh the show that took all the risks and landed the show that made a great story about shoguns space aliens and amazing pop culture references and somehow made it work the show that surpasses its own original manga work ( no hate manga is great ) and the show that was able to leave me smiling and satisfied but at the same time upset that it came to an end I couldn't tell you how much this anime went from some random comedy anime to one of the best comedy's and best animes I've ever seen a big well done to gintama.",
        "This anime is great in every aspect . funniest anime by far , has some of the greatest fights ever ,so many awesome characters which all have their own style, great story , so many great OST's . there are only 3 shows in anime that i can call godtier this one is one of them for sure and I have seen allot of them.",
        "I have only one thing to say, gintama is the greatest anime of all time hands down no other anime can ever reach or if not come close to it's heightGintama is not anime it is life itself it teaches you how important are the people around you and it gives its unique meaning of life if not the perfect one and how it should be livedForever yorozuya.",
        "I'm just another person here to tell you this show is amazing, though difficult to start. I abandoned it twice, before I got to the point of \"Ok, now I see why so many people say this anime is amazing.\"It is amazing.I don't think the first episodes are actually bad - I think I was the one who wasn't ready to understand and enjoy the show yet. It certainly gets a lot better and it doesn't take long - but as the story unfolds and amazing plots and jokes come along, there is also an understanding that comes slowly, from which a whole world of subtlety and nuances become accessible. This is what made the show amazing to me.At the same period of time I was watching the first 100-and-something episodes of this show, I was also reading \"The Complete Works of Zhuangzi\" (a famous book from Taoism, that later would mingle with Buddhism in China and, eventually, become Zen Buddhism is Japan). It was a great combination.The books describes the heart of the philosophy that later would give birth to Zen Buddhism - an important part of the Japanese culture, that helps to better understand the anime - and the anime demonstrates, in modern terms, some of the most sophisticated applications of that philosophy at practice. Even if it is fictional, it depicts behaviors and situations we can understand and relate to.",
        "It has a balance between action, strong plot and great comedy. I've seen hundreds of animes at this point, but nothing truly beats Gintama for me.",
        "Epic What can I say more than that the only thing that make laugh And cry and extremely excited best of all time.",
        "This is the only Anime anyone ever needs to watch. Absolute master piece !Plot :11/10\nCharacters:12/10\nMusic:10/10\nArt Illustration:9/10\noverall:10/10\nHighly recommended !",
        "This is a parodic anime that has many references towards many other anime, mangas and some other mediums that are not japanese, for example Star Wars. If you wonder why this anime is so loved, it is because you can see everything in it, from comedy to action that can make you even cry. The main cast, Gintoki (the protagonist), Kagura and Shinpachi are incredible, I enjoy every second when I see them on my screen. The side characters are as funny and enjoyable as the main ones. Gintama has the best antagonist cast in shounen anime and Takasugi is just the best shounen antagonist ever.The first 50 episodes are kinda slow but still enjoyable, in the rest, this show is just a pure masterpiece. Shogun Assasination is the best arc in shounen tied with Chimera Ant arc in my opinion and Gintama is the best anime tied with Hunter x Hunter 2011.My ranking of the seasons: #1 Gintama\u00b0 ; #2 Gintama' ; Gintama':Enchousen ; #4 Gintama. ; #5 Gintama ; #6 Gintama Silver Soul Arc ; #7 Gintama: Slip arc.",
        "I watch it with some episode/arc/filler guide found in internet. You can watch the first 51 in 2x speed after that, you can jump (but unnecessary) to its major arcs which are awesome and wellcome to the world full of masterpieces.",
        "I absolutely 100% recommend everyone to watch it from the very start and please ignore the image quality, before you know it you will love the show so much it won't matter and then the quality gets much better in 2015 and 2017 releases. An anime that suits almost everyone..great comedy, tons of parodies, very likable characters, great action and fights, very heart warming at times...just about everything you could think of!",
        "Let's be honest, it's long (560+ episodes) and starts of slow, but these imperfections are what made Gintama perfect.The lore is amazing!The character arcs of the main characters as well as the side characters are just as perfect and satisfying.It has the wonderful elements of comedy, sci-fi, action...and you know what, watch it for yourself!",
        "So what is that we love about anime? E V E R Y T H I N G.... and Gintama is and has everything ! Do you want to laugh until tears. Gintama gonna make you. Want some action? Gintama brings the fiaaahhhh ! It really does amazing fighting scenes. Want interesting, funy, badass characters. You know the answer. Every opening and ending songs are amazing! Trust me on that one. I can go on and on and on and on.....JUST watch it!P. S. Gin saaan fo evah!",
        "The voice acting in this anime is so good that the characters feel almost real. Plus the comedy in it is better than any sitcom that you can think of. I my opinion, Gintama is much better than the Big three animes( Naruto, One Piece and Bleach.)",
        "Gintama is one of the funniest anime series which i have seen. It is really great especially for its time. I know that you cant dub most of the jokes of the seroes but i really wish that it had a dubbed version",
        "I don't know. I can't figure out why people love Gintama so much. Between its annoying characters, campy humor, and endless toilet jokes, Gintama is the worst anime series that I have ever seen. And out of the dozens that I have watched by now (maybe even hundreds), that is saying a lot.To start off with, you have the humor. Unless you are thoroughly steeped in Japanese culture, you are not going to get it; it will pass straight by your head. The characters are quite idiotic, and don't even THINK about watching this while eating unless you enjoy the taste and the feel of vomiting. The series has so many jokes about faeces, vomit, and snot that it is overwhelming.And it just goes on and on and on; if you watch, say, 4 episodes a day, it will take you over 100 days to put this series behind you. Why did they make so many of them? It doesn't make any sense whatsoever for them to pump out that many episodes when it isn't even good, and that doesn't even include the movies.I didn't like One Piece, either - but I would actually RECOMMEND watching One Piece over Gintama any day. Avoid this series!",
        "I have started watching it this year , discontinued in between and then restarted from where i left many times. But at some point I couldn't give up on it. I wanted to continue it and get the taste of this anime world everyday. It have too many laughs, cries and so many other emotions. Earlier One Piece and Inuyasha were my no. 1 . This took their place. I have fallen in love with most of the characters in the anime. And good thing is every character have their own stories and episodes side by side. Finished it today with the movie \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94feeling empty inside. But i know will rewatch it someday..."

    "Elfen Lied": [
        "I watched Elfin Lied for the first time a few days ago and was hooked almost immediately, watching the entire series in one day. I don't think I've seen another animation like it. Even though it is only thirteen episodes long I really cared about the characters and was left wanting more.It starts out very violently as Lucy, a mutant called a Diclonius who can kill with long, invisible arms, escapes from a secure facility killing almost everybody in her way. She is injured however during her escape and loses her memory becoming the innocent Nyu, so named as that is the only word she says.She is found by Kohta and Yuka a pair of cousins who take her in not knowing what she is. When threatened Nyu reverts to being Lucy and dispatches or maims any perceived threat. They are later joined by Nana, another Diclonius and Mayu a young girl who'd run away from an abusive home.Later in the series we are shown back-stories of the characters; in a couple of places this is very shocking.I liked the juxtaposition of very cute characters with a fairly violent action but wasn't quite as keen on the excessive nudity, some was justified but many times it felt like it was just there for titillation which a story of this quality didn't need.If it hadn't been for the excess nudity I'd have given this a ten as the plot, characters and animation are all great. I'm sure I'll be watching this many more times in the future.",
        "First of all start with the fact that there are only 13 episodes in total. With each episode about 25 minutes we are talking here about 3 hours and 15 minutes, like a longer film.It is hard to describe the anime, I have to start with the fact that it is very simple. All characters have the hair with the same color as the eyes, all eyes are big and moist and there are a lot of blank expressions or rather radical ones that remind me of children anime. It also has some of the annoying clich\u00e9s one has become used to see in Japanese anime: girls that are insanely in love with an awkward guy that keeps finding himself in embarrassing situations; evil head honcho that just has to be heartless and power driven; family connections taken to extreme (everybody has a sister, mother, father, brother involved in all of this).On the good side, the story is rather interesting: there is a new sub species of man that has the ability to project very powerful telekinetic hands that can rip a person to pieces (and often do) and that is researched inside a lab where they are kept and experimented upon like rats and Guinea pigs. A lot of anger comes out of this, but also the desire for human affection.Now this premise is a rather good one, the title and the music also promise a lot. Unfortunately the promise is unfulfilled and we lose the series to what I call \"Japanese telenovels\". With a more professional animation and a good direction this could have been a very good and emotional anime movie of one hour and a half.It is hard to describe the series, the best formula that comes into mind is Sailor Moon meets X-Men. I can't believe I am the only one commenting it :-?",
        "For the most part my experience is that the anime that hurls the most nudity and blood at the audience tends not to be worth watching unless you simply want to see naked, bloody cartoon characters. It is often a way of saying, \"the story and characters are bad, here's something to look at to make up for it.\"Elfen Lied is an oddity in that it contains oodles of gratuitous nudity and stomach-churning violence, yet the story is genuinely interesting, making you care about the characters and wonder at who the monsters really are.The reviews I've read here generally take the nudity more to task than the violence, the idea being that the nudity fails to propel the story whereas the violence underscores exactly how dangerous the tentacled girls are. On the surface this is a reasonable argument. Certainly the nudity is irrelevant to the narrative, failing to in any way define the characters, and in the case of girls chained nude in government labs, it feels quite exploitative (although one could argue that it was a technique meant to reinforce the inhuman status of the subjects to the lab's employees).The violence, on the other hand, has a horror-movie effectiveness to it. And I'll admit that a lot of the reason I didn't like it is that I'm squeamish (it's not nearly as hard to take in the manga). But the truth is, the series does not just efficiently show the damage, it glories in it. It is violence porn, like those Mortal Kombat games where blood spurts out in geysers. Violence was necessary, but the degree of violence simply was not. I think the reason you don't see much nudity in great anime, and generally less gore, is simply that the makers have faith in their story. Elfen Lied is a series that hedges its bets, and by doing so, it falls short of being the series it could have been; one that dared to stand entirely on its stories and characters.",
        "My first impression about \"Elfen Lied\" was quite positive, actually.The opening sequence (inspired by Gustav Klimt art) was one of the most beautiful and original intro sequences that I've ever watched in any television show (animated or live action) The story starts in a very strong way, with a gory (but also thrilling and well made) sequence, that keep my interest for what was going to happen next.After that incredibly violent sequence, the mood changes completely, moving from tension to a relatively calm scene\u0085And then, the same menacing character from the beginning, appears with a completely different personality, acting in a completely childish way. And then is when things start to turn strange.\"Elfen Lied\" is a brutal anime in every sense of the world. It has several sequences of cruelty,not only psychical but also psychological, with innocent-looking characters facing the most horrible things. But also, as strange as it sounds, it also contains several \"cute\" moments (some of which are incredibly corny or annoying) I guess this combination of gore, cruelty, melodrama and cutesy was completely deliberate, but I still found it to be somewhat awkward and weird.On the good side, the animation is pretty good, the music is excellent and the character design is pretty well made. It also has an interesting premise, and several sequences of tension that are wonderfully done, but in the other side, it appeals to several annoying clich\u00e9s, some forced melodrama and very dumb attempts of include some \"comedy\" in this incredibly dark and bleak story. It was annoyed by the fact that, during the series, almost all (If not all) the bad things that happen in the story are caused directly or indirectly by men, with almost all the female characters being their victims.Excluding Kouta and Kurama, all the important male characters from this show are portrayed as abusive monsters that enjoy torturing (both in a psychical and psychological way) and making innocent girls suffer. Personally I think that this perspective is very biased and unfair, and it really didn't let me enjoy the plot of this series.Some scenes are very, very unpleasant to watch, and some of them seem to be just way too gratuitous, or included only for the sake of melodrama. The overall result was satisfying though, with an ambiguous, but convincing resolution.Definitely, this series is not for everyone. I guess some viewers will find \"Elfen Lied\" to be way too nasty, tasteless and trite, and I'm afraid that part of those affirmations won't be way too far from the truth. However, in my opinion, despite having a very unpleasant story, this series still has many redeeming qualities, that deserve appreciation and recognition. Even if I'm not very much into very violent anime, I have to admit that \"Elfen Lied\" keep my interest until the ending of the story, and that's way more than any other series from this kind have achieved until this moment. For me it was a worth-watching experience, but I would recommend only to those viewers who are able to handle not only the most violent and cruel elements included in a story, but also the most sickly-sweet ones.",
        "I have to say this anime was quite destructive with its hype of gore and Lucy killing everyone around her with her powers. It was even sad that near the end that the father Kurama and cute little Mariko were killed by a bomb when they were trying to cross the bridge. That nearly brought tears to my eyes seriously!The anime was pretty engaging which is all I have to say!",
        "This anime definitely intends to be controversial, but it isn't violence for the sake of violence such as 'Fist of the North Star' and countless worse flicks. The abuse of the mutants in cruel experiments, chained to the wall, and their explosive revenge attempts provide the necessary contrast for beautiful scenes such as Nana taking her first bath or Lucy going to the zoo, since they are considering this the best things ever happened to them in their life. 'Elfenlied' doesn't say it's cool to rip bodies apart - it says that life is hell without the simple pleasures of daily life such as warm house where you sleep in peace, friends to stay with and getting something tasty to eat. Even if the basic idea seems a little far fetched (a handful of mutants trying to kill billions of human beings to take over the whole planet, shall we really believe that could be possible?), it is fortunately all handled with class in the characters, story development, animation and music, until all loose strings (due to personality split and memory loss) are tied. Although bordering on the tasteless sometimes (writers should remember: the killing of a cute pet dog always upsets an audience much more than the killing of a man), a brilliant anime!",
        "I caught two episodes of Erufen R\u00eeto on the USA digital cable Anime Network a few weeks ago. Sadly, that is all they left for viewing - two episodes. I was hooked. I literally ran to my nearest Anime store and bought the entire 13 episode collection, bought a few slices of pizza, some water and for a few hours on a Saturday watched the entire series. That's how addictive this is. Addictive and good.I'ma classical art and music buff so the opening shots and music were enough to get my attention - and it should, for these two elements are a part of the story as well. Let me say, this is NOT for the kiddies. There is blood, destruction, sexual innuendo/situations, nudity - and some scenes dealing with children and pets will definitely disturb many people out there. But oh yes, there is blood ....and there's tons of violence here.You cannot escape the good animation here, the richness of it to the story and while not insanely detailed, it does focus upon what you are watching - and what you are watching is a story regarding a teen female of another species that has developed two personalities. One is of what she really is: a device to wipe out all of mankind as we know it and create another in 5 years and the other what she could be - an innocent looking for love, reception and overall acceptance. The animation is good in displaying the differences in our main character Lucy/Nyu and those like her.I don't want to give too much of the story away here for this is one of those 13 episode stories I hope those who like this genre will try to look at openly. But I will comment on the last episode - it leaves the door open for another series set (or movie) and I really hope they do go back in and do another. To me, there is no doubt of who is the shadow at the gate and if so - we know there were at LEAST 35 of these creatures. We saw three, with Lucy being \"Queen\". And while the assumption was all female...in this series we have the knowledge of two...males.Erufen R\u00eeto is one of the recent good, gripping episodic Anime series that will stick with you even after you've seen it all.",
        "It is a sad comment on society when someone makes an anime this excessively gory and twisted-- and then the community in general give it high ratings. I'm not discussing censorship; I'm discussing good taste and basic sanity. It would take a warped mind to enjoy the incredible gore presented in just the very first part of this anime (at which time I shut it down). This is some of the worst representation of anime genre. If normal audience were first introduced to anime via this series they'd likely never watch anime again.Would this have been a better anime without all the gore? Sure it would... except in the opinion of the gore-addicts. That's the shame of it: it could have been a better show.That there are people who think this is \"entertainment\" and enjoy such stuff explains a great deal of what is wrong with this world. I expect a whole lot of neg-rates on this review. Don't care. This is unnecessarily gratuitous tripe.",
        "Rating: 6.9Favorite Episode: No returnA violent story about nature vs nurture, eugenics, regret, redemption, and racism. The presentation was great, and the OP was incredible. The series evokes a sense of melancholy that hits you like a train when it ends. Plotwise, the series is haphazard, and most of it boils down to bland characters: Kohta is just a nice harem protagonist, Yuka is an obnoxious (and incestuous) tsundere, etc. Comically villainous characters ruin the nuance of the conflict: Bandoh is a psychopath who primarily yells and threatens to shoot anyone and everyone. Those children that found Lucy's dog and decided to beat it to death in front of her, come on, children aren't that blatantly evil. Excessive nudity that has little purpose: we can't go 2 episodes without seeing a naked underage girl. Plot points are either poorly executed or make no sense altogether: Kohta \"forgetting\" his trauma with Lucy despite meeting Lucy again eight years later is stupid; anyone with trauma has trouble forgetting their trauma, that's literally PTSD. Soldiers throughout the series (even in the ending) shoot Lucy when their whole goal is to recover her because she is needed to start the new human race. Lucy's true origins were never explained. Why was she orphaned in the flashbacks? How did Kurasama and co figure out she's Eve? Why is she Eve anyways? Lucy and Nyu flipping places whenever the plot demanded: They tried to show that a strong emotional reaction from Lucy's alter ego (the shell) or large concussive forces can trigger a mind flip, but this isn't consistent as she was upper cutted into a graveyard in episode 3 by nana and didn't flip, and also was sedated and flipped because her \"alter ego\" went to sleep. If this was the case every time she went to sleep as one person she'd wake up as another, doesn't make sense). The ending is open-ended, and threats like Chief Kakuzawa are still going strong. A poignant show with sloppy execution.",
        "Personally, I imagined \"Elfenlied\" to be better.The story is more or less interesting and so is Lucy's backstory, but that's pretty much it.The splatter scenes are still quite entertaining.I don't know how many of them there were at the time, but nowadays the concept of mutants in the form of humans is raised, which raises the philosophical question of whether humans are anything new and therefore quite boring these days.Also, I liked the depiction of nudity in the first episode because it wasn't overly sexual and still made sense, but unfortunately that's changing and you get anime boobs slapped on the screen whenever it's appropriate.It also feels like only girls were mutated here so that nudity could be shown again and again to keep viewers happy.It's worth seeing, but far from the masterpiece it's often called.",
        "I don't know if I've ever been so internally divided about how I felt about a series as I've been divided about this one. On one hand, you have potent stories of loss, regret, guilt, pain and then finding both hope and redemption. On the other hand, the series also is mired in unnecessary degrees of exploitation.The setup is pretty simple. Lucy, a sociopathic horned mutant capable of blocking bullets and slicing people to shreds with her invisible arms escapes from the facility that holds her in a murderous rampage. During her escape, she loses her memory and washes up on a beach where she's taken in by a pair of college students. As the series continues, you learn little bits about all the characters and a few more are introduced slowly and you see where all the characters and learn about what has helped to cause them to become the way that they are.The first episode is intense. In fact the opening sequence feature scores of people being dismembered while alive by a nude Lucy. There is a ton of blood exploding everywhere and the acting given to Lucy is absolutely chilling. And one of the most powerful things about this beginning is that it immediately instills in you a sense of dread whenever Lucy shows up, because of her clear disregard for human life (she appears to kill humans almost indiscriminately).At the same time, my problem with the series shows up in this intro too. All the mutant characters that eventually show up on the series spend a significant portion of their on-screen time nude. While at times, this is done for artistic effect (for example, showing the degrading inhuman conditions that they are kept in by their captors), there is clearly exploitation going on at the same time, which you can tell because of the later \"panty shots\" as well as completely unnecessary scenes of naked Nyu (Lucy's simple and innocent alternate persona after she gets amnesia). This is furthered by the sexually natured antics Nyu engages in. Although there are a couple points where this is done for comedic effect, it's completely unnecessary and distracts from the storytelling. It's not porn, but it's certainly excessive.Although I want to level the same critique against the violence of the show, I cannot, because the terribly graphic nature of the violence goes a long way to creating the necessary dread for and awe of the mutant characters, rather than just for fanboy points. So, part of me thinks that the writers and artists themselves had the same view of the mutant females as subhuman as the humans on the show (despite the surprising degree of humanity that is injected into these characters).I have to say that I was really impressed by how quickly the show moved along and was able to conclude its entire story arc. This thirteen episode series is packed with story and backstory, some of which is quite poignant because it deals with crimes in the past done, both to the main characters and by the main characters and the fallout on all the characters involved. And yet, despite its frequently somber and horror-tinged tone, the series manages to gather some hope together for the redemption of most of the characters involved. In addition to impacting my emotions, the stories told managed to dance in my imagination for hours after I finished each episode and I hungrily devoured each disc as it arrived from Netflix.Overall, I really like Elfen Lied, but I have strong issues with the exploitation element involved. It would've been a much stronger series had it controlled its fanboy-catering temptations and packed in more story (it was adapted from a manga series--so you know that more story was there). But I was pleased that it really did seem to open and close with Lucy's story arc and told a solid tale of a terrible mistake, the price to pay, and the redemption thereof. I cannot recommend it, because of its exploitative nature and because many will likely be disturbed or distracted by its graphic nature, but it remains an impressive series regardless. Just one that could've been improved with more restraint. 8/10.",
        "Quite simply one of the most astounding pieces of TV I have ever seen. Beautiful, disturbing, sweet, harrowing, violent, charming, graphic, sensitive.The paradoxical nature of the elements makes for an absolutely spellbinding experience.The premise - the show starts with a high security alert at a secure facility. A young girl is seen escaping, nude, but with some kind of strange, torturous looking device on her head. As heavily armed soldiers approach her, they are ripped to pieces by an invisible presence, in a most graphic fashion. So the scene is set.The young girl is a Diclonius - a human with horns - and the soldiers were destroyed by her ability to produce 'vectors', invisible, super strong appendages that shoot from the body like extra arms.If it all sounds a little odd, it is, but it does all make sense.Simply put, this is tour de force TV, quite unlike anything you would ever see from Western TV companies, and essential viewing.",
        "This is a very disturbing series, not so much for the over the top gore, but for the dark places the plot often goes, having a lot of psychological cruelty, with lots of horrible things happening to cute and innocent characters.Some moments are frankly unpleasant, almost taking a sadistic glee in the suffering of the poor girls.But it is also a pretty great series, with a moving plot, and amazing animation.Normally I'm not into gory stuff (Most of the gory shows I like tend to be humorous, like Drawn Together or Superjail) but I think Elfen Lied is an excellent anime, despite its extreme edginess.Nana, Mayu and Nyu are absolutely adorable, kinda wish they were in a much happier story.",
        "The story of number 7, a diclonious that escapes her incarceration in the lab of mad scientist,where experiments are made on her. A diclonious is a human that underwent certain nutations in his DNA and as a result develops two horns and hands that are invisible and with which she can kill. Also diclonious has a split personality,one normal like when Lucy becomes that inncoent girl that knows nothig about the world and one personality that is avengful and kills people on the spot, on a mission to cleanse the earth from the human race. Number 7 moves to the home of two friends kiyota and his gf amd stays with them without them knowing her true nature as a killer. Later people from the lab send number 35 after her,another diclonion to bring her back but she shops off her limbs. Theybsend send the strongest gil thy have with shadow hands more numerous than normal diclonioan to finish lucy off. A cool bloody series and at times just scary. The soundtrack is cool. I enjoyed it. I woyldnt say it is one of the best of things i ve seen,no. Just enjoyable show",
        "Disappointed,saw the series based on the hype and I had read the manga ages ago,although I didn't remember much from the read besides the start being slow and ending being amazing.Well the anime is just a waste of time. The production focuses on shock,nudity and gore as the core,without much emphasis given on plot or script.It's not able to play out the emotions which are the center point of the manga as far as I remember.In condensing the series the anime loses out on proper build up. Felt the anime tried to please too many genres which just don't fit in together.I am pretty sure harem and deepness don't go hand in hand. Only thing I liked about the series is the haunting melody \"Lilium\" and even that is an acquired taste.",
        "Elfen Lied is an anime that does a very bold thing by having so much cruelty, gore, and nudity in one series, but the end result is an anime masterpiece that wouldn't have been as good without it. Just remember that it's not R+ rated for no reason.",
        "Depending on who you ask, Elfen Lied is either a deep, disturbing masterpiece cut short or shallow, exploitative, and pandering. Elfen Lied is one of the most violent, dismal shows out there, with a good deal of nudity, too. It can be tough to watch, and one has to question the point of the exploding bodies.I kind of love it. Its rare to sit through something absolutely bleak. It starts with a bloodbath, and only goes downhill from there. And in contrast to the usual anime violence, the plot is melancholic at best, misanthropic at worst. It wants to tear apart your heart stings, and it even penetrated my soul.But I have to wonder if there's any objectivity here. I liked many characters, but I'm not sure how to feel about our most important trio, Kouta, Yuka, and Lucy/Nyuu. I can defend their personalities, but I probably couldn't defend their love triangle. The love in this anime exists less because of passion and compatibility than it does convenience. They sell it well, though.There are bigger problems. Elfen Lied looks cheap. Not a single scene is impressive from a visual standpoint, and the main cast have titanic eyes. Elfen Lied has fan service in a morbid story, often with underage characters. The nudity in the labs was fine, but elsewise was out of place and creepy. Most infamously, its ending is relatively quick. Its an ending, but it leaves you wanting a bit more, and is not true to the manga.The opening is one of the best out there. \"Lilium\" is hauntingly beautiful. A mixture of joy and sorrow fills my heart every time I hear it. Good thing, too - its pretty much the only song they play in the anime. I'm glad they found their \"Requiem for a Dream\". The opening also has the only good animation in the show. Its the closest cartoons have ever come to \"erotic\".I'd recommend it if you want a somber mood, and can tolerate gibs. Its only 13 episodes long, so you have little to lose...besides your good mood. :c",
        "I have hardly watched any anime series. This is literally my first anime series. If there was a little more detailed explanation, I think everything would be clearer.",
        "I'm afraid all I can rank this series is a 5. I just can't rank it higher except I would give it a perfect 10 in terms of the perfect horror. But as I mentioned this series is purely excessive at best.The Diclonius, a mutated homo sapien that is said to be selected by God and will eventually become the destruction of mankind, possesses two horns in their heads, and has a \"sixth sense\" which gives it telekinetic abilities. Due to this dangerous power, they have been captured and isolated in laboratories by the government. Lucy, a young and psychotic Diclonius, manages to break free of her confines and brutally murder most of the guards in the laboratory, only to get shot in the head as she makes her escape. She survives and manages to drift along to a beach, where two teenagers named Kouta and Yuka discovers her. Having lost her memories, she was named after the only thing that she can now say, \"Nyuu,\" and the two allow her to stay at Kouta's home. However, it appears that the evil \"Lucy\" is not dead just yet...Now I don't doubt it is the perfect the setting and the perfect situation to stage a horror film. If you love Horror than this is the series for you. If you are partial or just looking for something with depth this probably isn't for you. I don't doubt Elfen Lied has some serious depth in the story, however I'm far to distracted by the shere amounts of blood and gore and violence. I can understand why but I frankly don't think it's needed. Sadly that is all a series like Elfen Lied has going for it is the pure shock factor. It shocks the audience with the gore and violence and the nudity but in the end it doesn't do a series justice. Shock series last for a time but they don't last forever, and that is what I see for Elfen Lied. A shock series that will last until another shock series comes along. It's how all horror works and it's probably how this will work. Of course I could be wrong and Elfen Lied will become a classic but we'll see.Now on some positive notes, the acting in Japanese is splendid. While Lucy is of course the coldblooded murder machine Nyuu is her adorable child-like split personality. I haven't seen it dubed so I don't know how the dub was. The opening theme is perhaps the best I've ever heard. An operatic song in Latin is just perfect even for a series like this. Not to mention provides the perfect eerie atmosphere, especially when it goes over to the male chorus. The whole music score is perfect for this series. Animation quality is excellent.Overall Elfen Lied has it's appeal if you love horror. It's not a story for the faint of heart or the squeamish. If you can look past the 100% excess of Gore and Fanservice you may find you like it. If you don't you will find it like me, a noisy, gore and fan service festival. Nothing more.",
        "If someone's describing this series to you, it might be difficult to find the right words. But I could forgive them if the only thing that comes to mind is \"messed up\". This is one that will test its audience through its own cheer audacity. The first episode starts right off with a creepy murder fest, And by the end of the series decapitations and all manner of gory splatterfest spectacle will seem almost mundane.Urination, incest, infanticide, child abuse of both the sexual and physical torture kind, sadism, animal cruelty, this show doesn't say away from anything. And I'm here for it. Not because that stuff makes the show good (it certainly does not), But because of the boldness of vision that allows it to be included and somehow work.This is a tale of trauma, identity, persecution, and many other human traits. But the core of this story is how hurt people hurt people and the ways in which we all we all process and cope with the unbearable suffering that life brings, And and some of the more shocking elements here (even by anime standards) all have good reasons for being in the story. The point is to push things to an extreme to drive home the point. Not just for shock value.And this series does not disappoint in bringing together a story that touches on many threads of the human emotional experience that defy rational explanation. It's a beautiful tragedy and yet one that has a sweet ending to it that bequests the viewer to remember above all else to find kindness to offer to others and to remember to look for joy in one's own life.Also this is worth viewing simply for the fact that it was a major influence to the writers of stranger things.",
        "This is another anime that a friend told me of so I looked for it and I don't regret watching this because this was a great anime not just in terms of the animation, the powers of the diclonius or the story but psychological aspects pertaining to certain characters.Elfen Lied also dealt into issues regarding humans as well in a variety of ways which I don't like to spoil for anyone. Kohta was a likable character even though he can be clueless at times as for his cousin Yuka well she is really a nice girl despite a jealous streak. Also relationships between cousins is not considered incest at all in Japan and frankly I don't consider it that either but that's MY opinion.I liked this anime very much and its one I definitely recommend.",
        "Generally, I don't watch cartoons and don't give them ratings here nor write reviews as well. But this one is so perfect as I simply can't ignore this and pass over. Would express big thanks to the director of the picture and to the person who recommended me this so I improved my representation of lots of things end pushed a new item to my own list of the best human works ever.\nSo why have I liked this movie? Because it is extremely beautiful and authentic. I haven't seen earlier such mix of different visual and story-related approaches. This movie is full of meaning, but also it contains elements slightly related to hentai which is famous for it's simplicity of plot because of giving much focus to nudity and sexual beauty. This picture has plenty of blood, violence scenes, but there are also a lot of place for real feelings between people which make you to be truly interested in lifes of main heroes. Surely, there are some parts that were borrowed from another stories, though it is completely not redundant. Lastly, it is perfectly twisted so you can't guess all the details before end of the last episode and even after this is ended, you stay exaltated as well as slightly embarrassed about what was it.\nThis movie left after itself the unique vivid feeling of the great pleasure for some time as well as strong desire to find out more about the original story, but it requires no continuation - it would make this just worse. It is as exciting as the book of the russian writer Vladimir Sorokin which is called \"Roman\" and which has been read by me few months earlier and which I have also liked a lot, and although if we compare these two compositions, they seem like turned upside down in relation to their concept of story and plot (won't say more to avoid spoilers), another criteries will show us that the only big ideal difference between these two is about spreading of different styles on the surface of the entire story - if in the book of Sorokin it is concentrated in separate places, this movie seems like going to shuffle and bring together different discurces as much as it is possible and by this born something extremely beautiful and unique.\nAnd that is very sad that is really hard to find movies like this, I have tried to ask Google about this, but haven't got any results (maybe it is impossible by definition because of too big difference between such pictures which makes it unavailable to reach one knowing others). However said in this passage should not be interpreted as the lack of logic - the best movies of our time, movies like this, are really very similar in sense of making a big effort to improve contemporary understanding of art, culture and philosophy one level upper. And on the other hand, what have improved our understanding of ourselves cannot be applied once again - that is unique transaction which could be used, at least, as the material for the next attempt, which have to use different approach.",
        "The story: The \"Diclonius\" \u0096 a mutated form of human with extra powers, is dangerous to humans but growing in number. Can they, should they, be contained and eradicated? Elfen Lied flinches at absolutely nothing. Some have written on IMDb that it is entirely predictable, but I disagree. One thing that cannot be predicted is what character lives and which dies. In most movies in general (not just anime) you can tell right from the start who will finish the movie.For example, right in the opening minutes the play develops typical clumsy and cute secretary, who always spills the tea and takes pratfalls. Most often in anime a character that has that much attention paid to her would bumble her way through the whole story, often in danger but never getting hurt. Not so here. She has her head torn off right after a typical pratfall as quickly as you got to know her.This happens often. To innocents, good guys and bad guys. One young girl \u0096 a central character no less -- has all four arms and legs torn off.So what else gets served up? It just gets started with the decapitation and dismemberment of anonymous soldiers and office workers. Once the storyline gets going you get to watch child torture, child rape, child murder, an innocent puppy bludgeoned to death, and many additional casual abuses of both humans and non-humans. One of the more disturbing scenes is a young nude Diclonius (to appearances a 9 year old girl) is chained to a wall where shells are fired at her head. It is up to her to deflect them with her powers, but she is scared and pleads for them to stop. They don't, and instead increase the power until one gets through and kills her. \"270 joules,\" says one of the scientists. \"I guess that's the limit.\" So back to the original question, is there a point to all this? The answer is a tentative yes, although the point could have and perhaps should have been made less forcefully and you really have to question whether it was worth it.All the gore, violence, and cruelty is jarringly contrasted against all the elements of a typical anime romance/comedy. Yuka, a pretty and inoffensive cousin of Khota, has a thing for him and inclined to jealousy and hurt from the fact that he can't remember a childhood promise he had made to her. She doesn't know the whole backstory, and her romance with Khota is sidetracked with his penchant for taking in young stray girls in need of refuge.The first such is Lucy, who unbeknownst to Khota and Yuki is a dangerous (but not the most dangerous) Diclonius creature who had escaped from the shop of horrors described above. She has reverted to an intermittently infantile state, and they take her in and care for her. However the shop of horrors wants her back and shows no restraint in what they will do in pursuit of that, including using other Diclonius as weapons. Much mayhem abounds.The messages are all pretty blunt if not clear: There are no good guys, or they are worse than the bad guys. Innocence is surrounded by evil. Evil is often beautiful (this last point is most vividly seen in the truly interesting artwork in the opening credits and the music score) but is still evil. It will be up to the viewer to say whether it is all worth it.",
        "Elfen Lied is a very sad anime but it's very beautiful at the same time. This anime was well worth my time even tho it was only 13 episodes long. The story in this anime is dramatic and gruesome, the characters are interesting and well developed, the gore is great, the music is great, the voice acting is very good in Japanese(tho I feel the dub could've been better) plus the animation isn't too bad either. The anime's faults however is that it starts of rather slow but then it picks itself up as it progress's. It's also not for people have weak hearts and can't take very dark storytelling (even tho I think this is what made the anime great). It's also quite short too. The emotions I got from this anime made me feel sad, happy, angry and so on. It's one of the saddest animes I have ever seen and I recommend it to people who like dark/sad animes.",
        "A diclonius (a human with horns and psychic abilities) escapes from an army base, after being experimented on, killing a whole heap of guards and ends up on a beach, with her memory lost. When a boy named Kouta starts to live with his cousin Yuka in the beach-side inn, they find the diclonius and name her 'Nyu' and look after her, but that's when the horror begins.Yes I know, it does have a lot of nudity (most may find it a bit gratuitous) and also, after looking at the first part of the first episode, it looks like you've seen it all before (a person escaping from a place by killing a lot of guards with their super-powers), but it's not one of those cartoons; this cartoon can be really deep at times and you can even feel for the characters. Also the ending of this anime will really make you stare at the screen blankly and think of nothing else but ELFEN LIED.The animation in this anime is pretty cool, with a nice touch of CGI. The opening sequence of this cartoon is quite nice as well, although I don't think it's as good as other people say.Overall, ELFEN LIED is a pretty darn good anime, but it's not for everyone."

    "Cowboy Bebop": [
        "Animation and anime I have loved for as long as I can remember, and Cowboy Bebop is one of the greatest examples of anime at its best. Everything about this show is exemplary. The animation is just wonderful, right from the detailed character designs, beautiful and haunting colours and the ethereal backgrounds to the coupling of the dazzling action and some of the most jaw-dropping futuristic spectacle in animation or otherwise known to man. The music stays in your mind for a long time and not in an irritating sense, always fits with the drama and shows complexity in mood and orchestration even with its very jazzy feel. Cowboy Bebop also displays some really fine writing, it is poignant and intense yet also humorous and thoughtful, and balanced without any qualms at all. The storytelling shows evidence of great ideas thoroughly and entertainingly explored with little too dark or too light-hearted, there is an ideal combination of both. The characters are interesting and not revolved around clich\u00e9s, these characters especially Spike are well-developed and any person watching the show would relate to them. The voice work is very dynamic. In conclusion, an outstanding show in every aspect, don't miss it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
        "It's 2071 and humanity has spread out to the rest of the solar system with the use of hyperspace gates. A gateway accident has left the earth's surface inhabitable due to the random rain of rocks. The kung fu savant Spike Spiegel and the weary ex-cop Jet Black are bounty hunters on their spaceship Bebop. They are joined on the crew by rival Faye Valentin, wacky hacker girl Edward Wong, and a data-dog Corgi.This is a fun, inventive space crime western. The closest comparison is Firefly. It's got great characters. I would have started the show with the entire crew instead of adding them one at a time. The ninth episode would be a great pilot where they add Edward, the final crew member. Each of their arrival on the ship could have been done as flashbacks. The jazz intro does lead to the jazz inspired feel of the show where the flow can be jumpy at times. A smoother flow would allow for an easier story telling. It's a stylistic choice that has both positives and negatives. As half-hour episodes, not every episode is a fully fleshed out story. It does lead to some two parters. This is an ambitious show with memorable characters.",
        "'Cowboy Bebop' is probably one of the best known anime series; I know I'd heard of it long before I started watching anime. Given that it is surprising how long I took getting around to watching it but as it was out of print I had little choice. Once it was reissued I got it as soon as I could and enjoyed it from start to finish. Just in case you don't know the series follows bounty hunters Spike Spiegel, Jet black and their ship the Bebop as they chase their bounties across the solar system. Along the way they are joined by fellow bounty hunter, the sexy Faye Valentine, a girl called Edward who is a genius with computers and Ein the dog. Over the course of the series we learn more about the characters as we watch them going after a variety of bounties; many of them dangerous and all of them entertaining.I had seen Cowboy Bebop: The Movie before watching the series and must say I prefer the series; it is more stylish with its jazz soundtrack and wide variety of stories. Being twenty six episodes long there is time to learn the characters back stories which makes them more likable. This series has one of the best casts of any I can think of; they are all cool in their own way. While it is primarily a drama there is also a fair bit to laugh at in many episodes without those laughs seeming forced. I watched the series in Japanese with English subtitles and thought it sounded good; I had heard that it also had a good English sound track so re-watched one episode dubbed and must say I was quite impressed.",
        "It probably needs to be said that I'm not well-versed in anime and that it's not usually my bag. But COWBOY BEBOP has the kind of reputation that even a greenhorn like me can't ignore. Sitting through the series (short as it is) proved an interesting watch, but only that. I have no idea what I was expecting and the hype probably did me in. I see the similarities to FIREFLY (they're often compared), but this wasn't nearly as watchable.But I'm not blind and can see that this is a well-made series. It's got great visuals (man, those establishing shots are something), great bluesy atmosphere, and attention to real firearms. The American voice cast seemed like good matches for their characters and I like that the Bebop crew just sorta fell in, no contrived reasons. And let me also just say that the music on this series was phenomenal, and enough for me to sell out the soundtrack. This show really had the knack for sneaking up behind you with a character's backstory. A session will proceed at its customary leisurely pace and then *bam!*, you just learned something major. The pacing did throw me off; here you have characters who are fluent in gunplay and piloting spaceships, and most of the time they're sitting back and talking. It was odd. The ending was also rather rushed for the same reason.I suspect a rewatch further down the road will change my mind on this. I certainly haven't given up as things like this tend to bug me. I'm the last guy to throw around \"overrated\", and that certainly doesn't apply here. But I do want to see what others do in this show.7/10",
        "I've watched all 26 episodes in two days. In the end I was about to cry for the lack of more episodes. This series has it all: good animation, good plot, attention to details, complex characters, good music. I actually saw the movie before the series and I liked that one too. I really hope the team continues with either another season of the series or at least a second movie.About the music, it's almost all of it jazz. And good jazz, as I normally hate the stuff, but here I found it great. The world is very well defined, waiting for more plot development. I really hate that in the end a lot of strings were left untied. Or maybe, just too tightly tied. I liked the character of Ed and it's a shame we don't know what would happen to her.Conclusion: great series, like a Ghost in the Shell with more focus on people and their stories. The technology is seamlessly integrated with the human nature that we all know, making it rather realistic. It's worth the watch.",
        "After a recent rewatch, I can say this series has aged incredibly well, being pretty entertaining to watch, very nicely animated, having a pretty interesting cast, and an absolutely amazing soundtrack, resulting in a rather excellent animated show.It is true some episodes are better than others, but the overall result is still pretty solid. Even at its weakest moments, Cowboy Bebop has enough virtues to be fully deserving of its status as a cult-classic, and not only among anime fans.Definitely worth-watching, at least once in a lifetime. The same goes for the movie, a worthy addition to the whole Cowboy Bebop experience.10/10.",
        "Attempting any kind of review of Cowboy Bebop is a daunting notion. The universe in which the show takes place is so immense it's difficult to get the right perspective necessary to present an opinion. Sometime after a devastating space gate explosion obliterates our moon, leaving the Earth uninhabitable due to endless falling debris, the human race has expanded to the rest of the solar system, bringing various cultures and architectures to new cities on new planets. Crime is always an inevitable part of human society and bounty hunters are just as relevant as ever as crooks planet-hop, run, and hide from the authorities.The crew of the Cowboy Bebop make a living hunting said crooks. There's big-hearted Jet, the former cop with a bionic arm. Spike, an easy- going fighter playing the bounty hunter game fast and loose. Fay, a mean-spirited woman suffering from amnesia and a longing to understand her previous life. And my favorite, Edward, an autistic and highly eccentric 13-year-old girl who works as the ship's computer hacker. I shouldn't forget Ein, the ship's intelligent Welsh Corgi.Though there is an important story arc throughout the entire series most of the episodes are self-contained and have a Tales of the Unexpected vibe to them. The tone of the show alternates between light and goofy and dark and serious with heavy Western, Jazz, and Noir influences. Cowboy Bebop effortlessly explores themes of friendship, loss, existentialism, and comedy while pitching a semi- optimistic future where humans are able to use science and technology to extend through the universe.I should also mention that this show RE-EALLY reminded me of Lupin III in many ways (not that it's a bad thing). If anyone reading this review is familiar with Lupin III you will understand what I mean. It all adds up to make a great show and perfect gateway anime for anyone who has been abstaining from the genre.",
        "The bounty-hunting crew of the spaceship 'Bebop' chase their prey through a fanciful future solar system in which many of the satellites are terraformed but Earth itself is a dangerous wasteland after a disaster shattered the Moon. Although most the 26 'sessions' are independent stories, there is an underlying story arc through which the complex history and motives of the main characters are revealed. The anime itself is an odd mix of styles, ranging from the hyper-cartoonish Ed, to the more real but exaggerated Spike, Ace and Faith to the realistic Ein (a Pembroke Welsh Corgi). The voice talent in the English version I watched was quite good (although the translations were sometimes a bit stilted and artificial sounding) and the characters surprisingly engaging (I even found Ed oddly endearing after initially being sure that I was going to tire of her quickly). The 'sets' and backgrounds are excellent and, like the stories (and the music), are an imaginative mishmash of genres including space-opera, western, chanbara, melodrama, and noir. I am not well enough versed in anime to comment on the significance of the series in the development and dissemination of the medium in the late 1990s but some sources suggest that 'Cowboy Bebop' was seminal.",

The show follows the crew of the spaceship Bebop owned by a former cop, Jet Black, whose past has left him a mixture of man and machine with cybernetic limbs and prosthetics, former syndicate enforcer, Spike Spiegel, who is haunted by his past and the woman he left to it, opportunistic con artist, Faye Valentine, a woman who carries a seemingly insurmountable debt but with no memories of her past life before being revived cryogenically, and Ed (aka Radical Edward) a young overly exuberant hacker who's equal parts technologically brilliant and eccentric as the group work as \"Cowboys\" to try in vain to keep their heads and ship above water.Created by Studio Sunrise and spearheaded by director Shinichiro Watanabe of Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory and Macross Plus. Initially planned by Sunrise's frequent collaborator as a selling point for Spacecraft toys similar to the model kits that shared a symbiotic relationship with the Gundam series, early on Bandai's toy division pulled support after deciding the series wasn't going to sell merchandise leaving the series in danger of cancelation before Bandai's sister company, Bandai Visual stepped in to save the project. The show became majorly successful, and is well known for being the first anime to be shown on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block in 2001 where even in spite of episodes being pulled due to the then recent events of 9/11, the show managed to get a major foothold in the United States to the point Adult Swim to repeatedly broadcast the show for four years afterwards. Cowboy Bebop has gone on to become a pop cultural touchstone for not only anime, but genre defying projects that don't fit neatly into one box with Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack choices and mixture of genres that run the gamut of homages everything from Spaghetti Westerns and Hong Kong Heroic Bloodshed to Film Noirs and even at one point Ridley Scott's Alien. Cowboy Bebop is a show that oozes not only style but the substance to back it up.The show at its core is a series of standalone adventures that could theoretically be viewed independently of one another(with series director Shinichiro Watanabe saying himself he approached each episode as if it were a mini-movie) but with the linking of the crew of the Bebop serving as our through line for the series with character growth and gradual reveal of hidden depths of our characters that reveals the both the psychological and physical scars these characters carry and what events lead them to this point. The running theme throughout the show is one being haunted by the past with Jet, Spike, and Faye carrying a weight of sadness behind their facades that the situation allows to seep out. The only one not haunted by their past is Ed who's very much \"in the moment\" and who despite being a brilliant hacker is prone to exercises in confusing silliness that are endearing and make a good counterpoint to the rest of the Bebop crew's often apathetic and cynical outlooks. The theme of being haunted by the past is carried through in many of the individual episodes with many characters often dealing with fallout from past actions/wrongs or motivated by some personal trauma or loss and the show will often allow these episodic stories to tie back to the Bebop's characters. Despite this though, the show never becomes overbearingly dour as the show mixes in elements of comedy both broad and/or dark and allows for a lot of humanity to come through in character exchanges even in the most seemingly minor points. The show also knows how to incorporate a healthy dose of action and excitement into the mix with some beautifully animated fist fights, gun fights, or spaceship based dog fights serving as engaging set pieces throughout the show's run. The show augments these moments with its eclectic soundtrack provided by series composer Yoko Kanno, and the music in Cowboy Bebop is such an integral part of the show's identity and why it works that Watanabe himself has said he'd often use Kanno's score as inspiration for entire scenes and set pieces, and that's clearly apparent at several points throughout the show.Cowboy Bebop is not just one of the greatest anime shows of all time, but also one of the best show's period. With its engaging characters going through well-constructed individual self-contained stories while allowing for growth and character exploration, and beautiful animation that leads to engaging action backed by an immersive and eclectic soundtrack, Cowboy Bebop has become a pop culture touchstone for a very good reason.",
        "The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called... COWBOY BEBOPCowboy Bebop is really is a new genre itself, it contains so many different elements of every genre that it eventually becomes something totally new. It is very entertaining and extremely watchable series (very easy to binge) but it also has some rough episodes that I didn't really like. My favorite ep is Pierrot Le Fou and least favorite is Wild Horses. The characters are all great and cool (especially Ed, she is me) but also I didn't really like Vicious as the main villain. Animation is also really good. I can't wait to watch the movie! I'm gonna end this review with cliche sentence but I just have to!SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...",
        "Mankind has colonised the stars, yet humanity remains the same desperate and power-hungry species in 2071. A ragtag duo of spacefaring bounty-hunters, Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, struggle to make ends meet living amongst the stars; and things are about to get a hell of a lot more complicated when they adopt the super-dog Ein, persuade the seductive femme-fatale known as Faye Valentine, and the teenage-hacker Edward. These five figures are about to come across things crazier than the crew of the Bebop itself.This anime right here is a timeless classic. Very entertaining from star to finish with an excellent set of characters.Intro and end was excellent.The English dub is probably the best from that area.If you want to see an anime that is about space cowboys I highly recommend this series.",
        "For some Cowboy Bebop is the ULTIMATE anime that there possibly can be. And I dare say I'm amongst those fans. Very few animes can measure up to the devoted fan base this show has garnered over the years, and the few other franchises like Fullmetal Alchemist and Death Note can claim to have half the following Cowboy Bebop has attained since its debut in 1998. The series is a neo-noir space-western that takes the best elements of things like Batman: The Animated Series' strong emphasis on shadows and Lupin III's wittiness and flirtatious nature covering up a complicated, smart and relatable protagonist in the form of anime heart-throb Spike Spiegel.Cowboy Bebop is a fun, violent, funny and artistically expressive television series that shows the unique and gorgeous flavour Japan gives the world in television and film. I think there's nothing to hate about this show: it's an anime that's inspired by two of the best genres in film: the Western and Film Noir. If you haven't seen any of the series yet, go ahead and dive right in for some very appealing, open-ended storytelling that doesn't need any pre-ordained cultural requirements. It's like Star Wars: anyone can appreciate regardless of their sovereignty or tongue.Go ahead and give this badass masterpiece of television a watch and see how it stacks up to the wider pantheon of television culture.",
        "Rated TV-MA for Violence and Some Sexual Content.Cowboy Bebop is a 26 episode animated series from Japan.Now to tell you the truth, I am not a really big fan of anime, I like the fairly violent anime films and the original dragon ball series but I am not a big fan of any others...except this one of course.If you are a fan of anime, you must watch this show now! It is amazing! Excellent story,characters,humor,drama etc.The show is basically about three(later four) bounty hunters and them doing their job.There was also a film adaptation of this, which I saw before watching the series.The movie is excellent as well.If you are an anime fan, check this one out.",
        "See you again space cowboy....Had the opportunity to watch the classic anime that is beloved by many.The story is mostly through single episode adventure that showed Spike and his crew going through life collecting bounties. I definitely like the cool and chill vibe throughout the show. However, my problem is that I didn't see a complete story that I could follow. I didn't find a lot of thrills in many of the single episode. Still, there were still episodes that were exciting and made me think about the message of the show. There was an overarching story, but I would prefer that there were more times dedicating to this main story.Of course the best thing about this show was the music. The opening was for sure one the best. It was so cool and definitely got me excited. Then, the music within the show was just as dope and create a unique vibe to each episode. This reminds me a bit of Megalobox, which also has fun and variable genres of songs.The four main characters had great chemistry with each other and created comedic moments. They also each had interesting backstories, but the show revealed little, more like a quick glimpse, of each character, and I can't help but desire more. Eh maybe that's not the point of the show.Overall, I enjoyed part of the show, mainly for its music and entertaining characters. 7/10.",
        "I got into this series around December 2005. I managed to see all the episodes during the summer. It took awhile to get all the DVDs.And I would agree with those who knew the series longer than me. It's very cool to watch.Cowboy Bebop takes place in the future, 2071 A.D. An alternate future when the economy and Eco system went bad on earth and numerous populations of humans fled to live on Mars, Venus, or any of the moons that are close by the other planets.The story is about a bounty Hunter name Spike Speilgel. Who has had a dark past which he doesn't talk about to many people. His partner is Jet Black owner of the Bebop starship. Jet is an ex cop who quit the I.S.S.P. for his own reasons. He's also like a father figure to Spike.Together they travel around the solar system to find some wanted criminals who have bounties on them. With those bounties Jet and Spike are able to get money with no trouble at all. Course they have to bring in the criminals alive, otherwise they won't get the reward money if the criminal is dead.Throughout the series Jet and Spike will get team up with Faye Valentine a young woman who's past is a mystery to her, Ein a data dog who is very smart, and Ed a girl who's naive but a talented hacker. With all these characters part of the Bebop team, they make one combination of teamwork, when they get along with each other.Each episode is good in it's own way. There's plenty of Character development too when you watch the entire series. I like how the series was influence by Lupin the 3rd. Which is pretty cool to see something that looks like it's Lupin, but it's incredibly different.Those who want an anime that's serious and not childish, may enjoy this show. It's very well animated, and since it's taken place in mixed cultures, it's very international. Featuring characters of all races and culture. Which I heard is why it's successful in the USA.So those who haven't seen the series, can check it out by borrowing the DVDs from someone you know or buy volume 1 of the DVD to see for your own opinion on the series. It's suggested for 13 and up due to it having language, violence, and some nudity.",
        "Cowboy Bebop is a notable anime from the 1990s. A so-called Space Western, it manages to be both entertaining and thought-provoking. The future world of the series is well-realized. Thankfully, there isn't an explanation in the first episode about how the world came to be the way it is. You learn more and more about it as the story progresses. Character development is key to the series. The four main characters aren't a bunch that you immediately like. In every episode something new is revealed about them, and this way you grow to like them. Their pasts are very important to the story. Faye Valentine got on my nerves at first because she was so selfish, but later it's revealed how she became this way. This realistic approach to characterization is commendable. But there is a fun side to Cowboy Bebop as well. Since Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are bounty hunters there are plenty of fights, chases, mysteries and humour.So, the series' setting and characters get two big thumbs up from me. Another reason why Cowboy Bebop is so respected is its soundtrack, which is excellent. Yoko Kanno fused rock, blues, country, jazz, pop and other genres into instrumentals and songs that are catchy and original. The music definitely makes the scenes better, in this case. But there are a few downsides to the series. Cowboy Bebop is similar to other 26-episodes anime in its structure. The first few episodes get it off to a good start because they're fun and well-animated, but the next several episodes are mostly a letdown in storytelling and animation. The series picks up again when Ed joins the Bebop crew. Most of the best episodes are in the second half of the show. The animation becomes gorgeous. Shinichiro Watanabe's direction gets better too. Cowboy Bebop includes many references to things that Watanabe grew up on. Most notably Western rock, Asian films like A Better Tomorrow (1986), and older anime. Cowboy Bebop gets a high recommendation from me. It's really one of the best anime ever; one that even adults can enjoy.The American Anime magazine Anime Insider (No. 50, November 2007) ranked the 50 best anime (available in America) by compiling lists of industry regulars and magazine staff, with Cowboy Bebop ranked as #1.",
        "Even if the series is not very long, I think it has left its mark on everyone who has watched it.Unlike many other Anime, you do not laugh and do not go on an adventure for the sheer sake of it, but instead it tells the adventures of four people who are unable to abandon their past and drag themselves forward in their life without having a goal. To aim for. There is a veil of sadness that covers each episode and that weighs on the viewer.A tragic ending worthily concludes the series which however remains pending without actually having changed much compared to the beginning as if they were all stuck in limbo.",
        "I will admit this before starting the review. I Hate Anime with deep passion. I just don't like it. But After watching \"Cowboy Bebop\" I admit I am impressed with this cult classic.The plot centers around a group of bounty hunters in the far future of 2071 in outer space. While the group chases down criminals one after one around hyperspace, they confront their past and tragedies, each character is forced down this path during the series and can't escape their true nature.Let me just say that once you get to know the characters and sympathize them, you are going to carry that weight.Upon watching the show I've quickly come to realize it's theme: space opera. The series draws a lot of inspiration from franchises such as Star Wars, Star Trek and probably 2001 A Space Odyssey as well.The soundtrack is one of the key elements to me if I'm asked what makes this show so great. Every scene and moment during the series is followed by a Jazz or Bluz session. The series's tone is inspired by American westerners and Jazz music from the 40's to the 60's And I love it.The characters are another key feature in the show: Spike Spigel is one of the more interesting characters I've got to see in animation. Jet Black is also a great character. Faye Valentine gives me some film noir vibes, something about her makes me think she's inspired by a fame fatal from the classic film noir movies. The only character I've had a problem with was Ed.Ed is a little girl who has great hacking skills but throughout the majority of the series it doesn't seem like she realizes where is she, I expect from her type of character to fear from the dangers of the galaxy and be a little weak than others.The final was very emotional and compelling, yet I feel a little missed around the characters, throughout the majority of the series it didn't seem like they were bonding or getting closer. The group kind of devided itself from each other. During episodes 12 and 13 I thought there was some turning point that would bring the group a little closer to each other:\nFaye acting as a big sister for Ed, Jet being a father figure for everyone, Ein the dog kind of wondering around, Spike comforting everyone. Instead each character departed itself from the others leaving a hole.Overall I loved the series, it is really poetic and philosophic, no wonder it's a cult classic that many should watch.",
        "'Cowboy Bebop' is a Japanese anime series that originally ran in Japan in 1997-98 and debuted in the United States on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in the fall of 2001. Recently it was thrust back into light of the present when Netflix decided to do a live action addition to the series. This is widely regarded as one of the best animated series of all time and one of the best anime series of all time. It explores numerous themes in a science fiction/western/noir mash-up of genres. While popular and critically acclaimed the show only generated 26 episodes.The show follows the fortunes of a handful of bounty hunters, colloquially referred to as cowboys, on the spaceship Bebop. While the show starts with only two crew members, Spike and Jet, through their adventures they eventually swell that number to five adding Faye Valentine, a kid named Ed and a dog-like being named Ein. Through these episodes we get to delve into each character's backstory a bit and find out why they are drifting through this futuristic dystopia mainly on their own until they discover one another and form a ragged little version of a family. Many of the stories swirl around attempting to track down bounties and while the crew and its personnel are adept there are usually some wacky shenanigans that cause them to miss out on their big bounty paycheck as they scrabble along attempting to eek out a living. The show is very episodic, but there are character and story arcs that run through most of the entire show.While I am not an anime aficionado by any means, nor do I turn a blind eye to it. The Netflix show looked like it had promise so I wanted to watch the original show before viewing that. While I do not think it is the best thing ever I do think it is quite good and am overall surprised that for a show that initially seems superficial it is actually full of depth, farce, action and exploration of inner turmoil all set in the midst of standard genre tropes. While 'Cowboy Bebop' nominally has Spike as the primary protagonist the show does an excellent job of delving into each character individually tapping their own existential angst. This is a very good series, and easy to watch as it does not take much time to whiz through the episodes which are in the twentysomething minute range. For anyone with a passing interest in Japanese animation this is something that should be watched and serves as a gateway into the anime genre as a whole, and while I am a stickler for watching a show in its original language the dub for 'Cowboy Bebop' is supposedly exceptional so those who hate subtitles can easily partake as well.Eric's Grade: B+",
        "An eclectic group of bounty hunters pursue criminals in a desolate future. This is the gold standard of anime as the characters draw you in as if they were real. Each story is beautifully woven and the animation is superb, with a plot that makes you think about life. Even if you are not a fan of anime watch this show as I am sure it will convert you.",
        "This series was once voted the greatest anime series of all time, and so any criticism of it is likely to incur the ire of its many devoted fans. For me, though, this series was sort of the Miami Vice of anime - very long on cinematic style and flashy visuals and very influential, but pick it apart and you will find that the underlying structure is weaker than you first thought, at least in the early going. The science fiction details are well thought through and the animation direction is very good overall, but when you start looking at story structure and character, the level of originality drops sharply. The first four episodes have basically the same story line - the bounty hunting main characters go after a fugitive only to find that he has stolen something top secret that other people want and are willing to double cross the bounty hunters over. In the fifth episode we find that one of the main characters used to be an enforcer for the mob. How novel. Okay, this probably sounds worse than it is.Beyond this point, quite fortunately, the story line breaks away from the formula to explore more of the universe of Cowboy Bebop and how the characters relate to it, all of which is a plus. The show's incredible visual sense, with a great many wonderful science fiction ideas thrown out often in passing and glimpsed but never in other than purely visual terms, and this continues, while the story framework gets more ambitious. More of Earth and why humans spread out into the solar system is examined as is how the crew of the Bebop came together and where they are headed. Love, regret, revenge are introduced and added skillfully to the mix. The storytelling is assured and varied and a strong emotional atmosphere hangs over everything as characters examine their choices, and their motives and wonder where they are headed. But even then, it's long on cool and short on depth. There is a lot of music in the series - jazz, blues, heavy metal - in fact many of the shows have a thematic music style, and this is a plus, but the resulting music video montages, once again elevate superficial style over dramatic substance. It's a really cool series to look at. With less of a formula approach, especially in the early going, it might be a perfect one.",
        "Where everything is perfect from hair to toe. I've watched this show for the first time in 1999 on the legendary MTV Anime Night here in Italy, I was prompted to my FIFTH rewatch (with original japanese language, of course) thanks to the news of a completely useless live action adaptation, and all the problems I had previously (namely, the lack of informations about the past of Faye Valentine) have been obliterated because that element is used by the director as a way to convey the central message of this anime or, better said, of all the episodes of this anime. Which are ALL essential and required to watch, otherwise you're not gonna get the general meaning and the character development. What central message? Watch the show more than one time and you'll unmistakeably understand it. Other than that, the characters all are more human than humans themselves, a family where every one has his/her flaws and strenghts. Add that to an impressive technical ability in terms of direction and editing and you have the best serial anime ever made in history, the serial anime to end all serial animes. On the movie side Kanashimi No Belladonna is unmoveable on the throne as the best of the best, on the serial side nothing comes close to Cowboy Bepop. I'm not saying this lightly. How anyone can find this series boring is completely beyond me. Of the big two 90's animes (the other one being Evangelion), this is the one that has aged like ambrosia. Excellent technique, excellent character management, messages of the meaning of life still relevant to this day, adult themes like gay love and the life of disabled people, AMAZING music - in itself a character of the whole show - simply watch every single minute of this masterpiece from start to finish, every single intro and outro included, and don't waste a single second on the live-action adaptation, which will NEVER be of this quality. To have it you would need a godly movie director or directress, which is simply impossible since not even lauded big budget Hollywood movie ones show this talent, at least to my knowledge. See you again for a next rewatch, Space Cowboy....hoping I have ended all the tears you made me shed in the meantime, during and after the runtime.",
        "Synopsis: The year, 2071. With the rapid expansion in space colonization, it became necessary to create instant travel between planets. The result was a number of subspace gateways; however, inadvertently, an accident during construction caused great damage to the Earth. In this time, criminals thrive across the solar system, and someone needs to clean up what the authorities cannot: bounty hunters. Among these are former mobster Spike Spiegel and former police officer Jet Black. Along with gambler Faye Valentine and hacker Edward, they put the law in their hands, for the safety of others, to reconcile their pasts, and most importantly, to put food on the table.I know, a great soundtrack, awesome fight scenes, and downright good characters, there's gotta be a catch. Not this time. At the twilight of the 20th century, anime was at its peak giving rise to Cowboy Bebop, a series that went above and beyond all expectations. Aside from one minute, yet potentially critical flaw, the viewer is left satisfied on all levels. Perhaps I'm just being nostalgic because this was the first anime I watched which wasn't some Saturday morning bastardization. But there's more to this than that.The first thing I would have to say about Bebop is that it's got class. I don't think there is any musical genre Kanno Yoko can't do. The blues create a perfect atmosphere, and even on its own it's a treat to listen to. Much like Escaflowne's(1,2) epic chorus and Turn A Gundam's folksy bluegrass, one is entranced by the score to the point that you might as well be at the symphony. In all honesty, the first time I heard Bebop's music, I had no idea that it was from an anime soundtrack, and boy was I surprised hearing it in the series.Visually, the series is stunning, with a style that seems unique to anime. Despite being science fiction, many parts give off an early 20th century jazzy vibe, which complements the story and music well. However, when the animation needs to show its sci-fi face the moment is captured so perfectly. And it doesn't just look good, it moves well too. Many anime boast about their amazing fight scenes but few deliver. The action here is fast paced, engaging, and totally void of stock footage.However, this is all icing on the cake. Where Cowboy Bebop delivers more than just about anything else is in its characters. Spike Spiegel is the ultimate stud, rivaled by very few. The rest of the main cast is just as good including the well developed Faye, Radical Edward, and Jet who emits rays of awesomeness. Beyond being likable and interesting, the characters also succeed relationship wise. Chemistry between the Bebop crew is pure, lacking even a single forced moment. The only characterization I've seen that rivals this is probably Planetes.Bebop also has one of the most fun and addicting plots in anime. The idea itself is simple; however, it is compelling as well. The compelling characters at the helm make you interested in their dreams and situations. The series is full of good examples of episodic stories. One, for example, involves Ed's misadventures while chasing a narcotics dealer in a setting closely resembling the Wild West, while another involves a sympathetic story set on Venus involving Spike's interactions with a man who wants to learn martial arts from him\u0085 for very personal reasons that Spike discovers later. These are just a few of the great stories and great characters that result in some of the most memorable moments ever to be shown on the small screen.Cowboy Bebop was so well done that I just didn't want it to end. There was so much to it, but at lot more could have been possible. It didn't help that Spike's story felt a little incomplete. Not bagging on the ending, it was excellent, but I can only imagine how much richer the series would have been given another five to ten episodes. What I personally experienced was similar to when I watched Fafner, being so entranced, so connected that I wished it could go on much longer. Alas, that is a sign of good storytelling which I can forgive, especially with a standalone movie that came later. I could go on forever, the epic moments, the fun battles, the dub that was as good (maybe better) than the original. But I digress, this review is starting to go overboard. I bid you ado, until next time, space cowboy.",
        "I had never seen this, and upon watching it I immediately understand why it is considered a staple and one of the better anime's of all time. It was visually stunning and its jazz soundtrack was smooth perfection, I wish I had watched this much sooner. Following a ship (the Bebop) and its bounty hunter \"cowboy\" captains, the series is much more episodic than I originally expected. A series that loves to dish out its lore and backstory ever so slowly through single line of dialogue hints or small details / easter eggs in backdrops, this show feels like it has so much to offer upon additional views, especially due to its short (only 26 eps) nature. I watched this in around 60/40% english / japanese often swapping during episodes. The english dub is superb, is what I ended up with most of the time. I'm sad it ended so early, I do really wish there was more, although there is a movie I haven't seen. Also after watching this I am not in any way excited for the new live action reboot, the best thing about the reboot is it making purchasing the streaming rights of the original seemingly profitable enough to do, so please go enjoy this on Netflix while its there.",
        "\" Dramatic, Chilling, and Bittersweet\"Probably one of the most unique and original animes I have seen in a while. It had a very interesting and amazing worldbuilding I mean who thought of doing a sci fi anime that takes place in the future in our solar system which has 2000s technology except for the spaceships and having a old school vibe/tone it. The consistency of this anime was alright, some episodes were just amazing and out of this world and others were a bit dull and were ok.The visuals were good. The art was alright, it didn't have that sharp and crisp look to it, everything seemed a bit unclear and undetailed. But the animation was amazing especially the fight scenes which was hype and the character designs which felt unique and original. The music was just everything! I shouldn't even be explaining. Jazz, country, mixed in with music from Japan it was just sweets for my ears.The characters were good. Even though we didn't get to know about much about the character cast's past they really did an amazing job on writing characters that were original and felt fresh. They had interesting flaws and unique personalities. Majority of the screentime went to the main characters and there were barely any recurring characters.Overall a very enjoyable series. It had some flaws and some confusing parts but also a lot of hype and just crazy moments. It leaves some questions behind and makes the viewers answer it themselves which was sort of a double edged sword for me.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely..."

    "Gungrave": [
        "This twenty six episode series follows childhood friends Harry McDowell and Brandon Heat as they rise from being a couple of street punks to being major figures in the Millennion crime syndicate. At first things go well and they are taken under the wing of Millennion's boss Big Daddy but in time things change; Harry is determined to rise to the very top of the organisation and that will mean getting rid of both Brandon and Big Daddy. When Harry gets his hands on technology that enables him to run an army of the dead known as Orgmen it looks like Harry will run the organisation for a very long time but then after thirteen years he learns that Big Daddy had a daughter, Mika, and he decides she must die too. This is a mistake as the man who helps her survive his attack has the technology to bring Brandon back from the dead. Once back Brandon is determined to protect Mika and have revenge against the people who killed him and the people he cared about.I must admit that I had some difficulty getting into the story during the first couple of episode but after that found myself gripped by the plot and the interesting characters. The back of the DVD case may say this is about Brandon seeking revenge against his former friend Harry but until the half-way point they are still the closest of friends. Because of this we believe in their friendship before we see it break down in such a terminal manner. This also makes it all the more tragic when characters we've grown to care about start dying\u0085 unlike Brandon the others don't get to come back. I liked the character designs; in particular I liked how we saw Harry age over the series; from a young man to a middle aged one with grey hair and a lined face. Surprisingly despite all he did the creators managed to keep his character somewhat sympathetic making his ultimate demise feel as tragic\u0085 I'm not ashamed to admit I shed a few tears at the end! Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want a character led anime that also has plenty of action; just remember some of it is quite bloody so it isn't really suitable for younger viewers.",
        "Oh, come on! How many almost-vampire vampire hunters and almost-zombie zombie killers can we stand? What? Normal guys can't kill zombies? Just look at Berserk! Ahem.Anyway, this series is a clich\u00e9 and nothing more. Anime clich\u00e9s are better than Hollywood clich\u00e9s, but nonetheless, boring repetitive crap. When I saw the scene where the guy purposely accepts being hit but some huge monstrosity just to show us he doesn't care, then fills the creature with bullets to show that he does care, I knew this sucked. But that silly woman he always carries around and the scientist/truck driver that accompanies him... Geez!To avoid!",
        "Yes I'm going to get pitchforks throwing at me if I say this but honestly this show was boring for me to watch. The animation didn't age well, the opening just had a boring song that didn't match the whole shows theme and we've all seen a \"badass guy with guns\" before \" (Hellsing,Cowboy Bebop, Vampire Hunter D). In all fairness, the dubs were great but it's the whole thing dragged on.I found out about this show at #9 through a recent article called \"20 Random Anime You Should Binge While You're Stuck In Quarantine\" on the Ranker site. Yeah I was keeping my hopes up since Madhouse normally does great anime but yup we can't like everything out there folks!On the bright side, I actually would be glad if this was getting a remake like I would want to see an oldie anime like this being redone again !",
        "Gungrave takes place in an undisclosed town that feels and looks like somewhere in Europe. The series focuses on a group of friends that tries, by committing petty crimes, to earn enough money and to perhaps, one day, become high in the social scale. However, the world of crime is very cruel and it will wait patiently to find a good opportunity to crush you once and for all. Sooner or later the two protagonists will have to pay for entering this cruel domain; they will pay a very high price, but, in the end, they will find a way out. The group of friends, of brothers, achieves their dream and they become members of an influential mafia organization. This organization is powerful enough to control everything. Gungrave is a story of how power and influence change people.Characters wise without a doubt I will straight up say that Braden Heat and Harry McDough were my favourite characters alongside Big Daddy and Bear.The animation and art style was very good and it suits the series tone very well.The voice acting in the English dub was excellent including Kirk Thornton, Tony Oliver, Kim Strauss, Michelle Ruff, Dorothy Fahn, Michael McConnohie, Dave Wittenberg, Bob Papenbrook RIP, Lex Lang, Steve Blum, Doug Stone etc.Story wise there are some problems I do have with it like in the first episode it literally takes place between the time massive skip then in the second it goes back to the past on how it all started. Personally I would watch episode 2-14 before 1 if you want it all in order.There is something I didn't exactly like such as I didn't really like how they put a massive age relationship between Maria and Big Daddy who was more like an uncle then a lover. While I know Maria and Braden's relationship wasn't very good but still, if there was something i would change about the story it would be this. While I know it was for the whole profess of Mika being Big Daddy's daughter or whatever but still.Oh and speaking of Mika I couldn't stand her in the slightest look she is cute I will admit and I do feel sorry for her but I found her down right annoying and a pain to sit through whenever she appears on screen. Oh and it's doesn't help that the writing did try to ship her with Bredon.Aside from those bad qualities I thought this was a fun series to watch.",
        "Already familiar with Yasuhiro Nightow's Trigun, Gungrave is a vastly dark, yet richer story. In this world, there are no good guys. Trigun's Vash was a kidder, but deadly with the steel. These guys hardly joke at all and it's a tale of struggling to survive at any cost. There's a theme of brotherhood, loyalty and betrayal almost like a John Woo anime. Soft spoken Brandon is mostly enigmatic and prefers action rather than words. But don't be mistaken: Brandon might even give Vash a run for his money. There are gang hits, conspiracies, and full out urban chaos and it becomes amazing watching it all progress. Hell, I found myself rooting for the gangsters to win! No lives are spared and people don't miraculously dive out of the way of bullets. Mixed with a great soundtrack and some great character designs, Gungrave is raw, gritty and, after finishing it, it even offers hope of brighter days.",
        "When I started watching this series on TechTV'S \"Anime Unleashed\",I gotta say that out of all the shows that I've seen. This one is a real killer. I only seen a few episodes,and after hearing about from Michael McConnohie,I decided to get it. But what really got me into watching this series is the action,and a lot of trigger happy gunfights. But most of all,the characters were pretty cool,and the storyline is the best. My favorite characters in the show are:Brandon/Beyond the Grave,Maria,Mika,Big Daddy,and Bungi. The series also features the great voice talents of:Michael McConnohie(famous for Transformers),Michelle Ruff,Lex Lang,Kirk Thorton,Tony Oliver,and others. But however,this show is the best,and do be careful when watching it. It may mess with your head.",
        "After watching the first episode I thought; oh man, not another cool-paranormal-man-defeating-zombies-anime. It looked very similar to Vampire Hunter D., Trigun and Hellsing. But at the second episode I discovered that this story begins with how our hero became an undead superhero. It takes about 10 to 15 episodes to tell the story of two young friends building up a career in the mob that's controlling their hometown. They start off as petty thieves and end as the chief-executives of the gang. At a certain point the story takes a dramatic twist that shapes the undead character ''Beyond the grave'', wanting to take revenge on those that deceived him in the past.The strength of this show is that it gives all of its characters a tremendous depth by building up their story on a slow pace. It creates a certain emotional involvement with the characters and their (mis-)fortune. They could've just chosen to tell this story in far less episodes and focus more on the action than on the dramatic sequences, but that would most likely lead to a lesser end result. As it is now, it's perfect for my taste.I really adored this impressive story about friendship, deceit, love and loyalty. It may contain some clich\u00e9s, but that doesn't withhold it from being a very powerful piece of anime.",
        "Gungrave is anime it is one the best anime i seen good acting action pack only 1 season but it good anime",
        "no detailed plot spoilers, but a general discussion of the progression of the series.gungrave works best when it is a moody crime drama, somewhat along the the lines of michael mann's 80s series crime story. the speculative fiction aspect--- the org men--- seems like an idea shoved into this crime world to make it conform to the video game and more like something for kids who like bleach. the \"science fiction\" element never fits comfortably with these characters and unfortunately distorts them into laughing evil clich\u00e9, injuring the dramatic integrity of the world.overall, gungrave is somewhat like a mix of berserk (which also begins obliquely) and hellsing, but not nearly as well written and psychologically compelling as the earlier and nowhere near as fun as the latter.bear walkin is a cool supporting character and the friendship of brandon and harry is enough to keep me engaged for most of the earlier episodes, but the action is badly directed and sloppy, which is unusual for a madhouse anime, since they are the most consistently excellent anime studio ever (eg. shigurui, x (tv series), death note, etc.).another negative observation is that the violence seems very toned down from what it should have been-- like the pg version of something that should have been a rough hard R (see berserk and shigurui).i'm surprised at the high rating--- this show succeeds somewhat as a moody crime drama, but really loses its way with poorly handled action (with three exceptions) and laughing \"evil.\"",
        "\"Gungrave\" is a standout anime in its genre, with a compelling storyline and memorable characters. The show is a perfect adaptation of the game, capturing the essence of its source material and delivering it in a visually stunning way.The characters are complex and multi-dimensional, each with their own motivations and flaws, making them relatable and human. The action scenes are top-notch, with fluid animation and intense, adrenaline-fueled battles.The music and soundtrack are also noteworthy, adding to the overall atmosphere and elevating the emotional impact of key scenes. The world-building is rich and immersive, and the attention to detail in the animation and design further immerses the audience into the world of \"Gungrave.\"Overall, \"Gungrave\" is a must-watch for fans of the game and those looking for a well-executed anime in the action genre. It is a testament to the power of good adaptation, and it is sure to leave a lasting impression on all who watch it.",
        "Gungrave is a fantastic anime with a great story and great English voice acting from Kirk Thornton\nTony Oliver Tom Wyner Beau Billingslea Lex Lang Michelle Ruff\nKari Wahlgren and Steve Blum.I also thought the show had tons of memorable characters and I enjoyed the friendship between\nBrandon Heat and Harry MacDowell and I thought\nHarry MacDowell was a pretty great villain.And I enjoy the relationship between Brandon Heat and Maria Asagi. And I enjoy the father-and-daughter relationship between Brandon Heat and Mika Asagi.I also thought the show had great animation a few emotional moments and pretty entertaining action sequences and a pretty great score.",
        "It took me awhile to warm up to this series. It was off to a spectacular start, with a costumed gunman fighting hordes of pasty monstrosities, but I really couldn't care. I could appreciate the great color and lighting, great sound, very distinctive style, but the action was just too contrived and full of superficial actions that only served to create dramatic tension.But I gave the second episode a chance, and it wound back in time to establish characters and tell a gritty yet sensitive crime drama of friendship and hardship, loyalty and ambition, a man's personal wars and loves. Though the action was slower, it was more believable, it served a narrative purpose beyond the scene, and it wasn't the main focus.When the story finally caught up to the setting of the video game, I realized why it wasn't that engaging; the action is better suited to interaction, and watching it isn't as involving as playing it would be. Until there's a port to PC that isn't going to happen, and getting through the final episodes is becoming a chore.It's a shame those comic-style episodes turned off so many potential fans, because the heart of it is an excellent work, and the final payoff is well worth it.",
        "This anime is a gem of its generation, they don't make them like this anymore. Gungrave, black lagoon, samurai champloo, cowboy bebop, trigun etc. I could go on but it was the golden age in action anime. If you haven't seen this or any I mentioned do yourself a favour a treat yourself, because they are truly incredible. PS. Start with Gungrave.",
        "This series, told throughout 26 episodes, combines the very best of mafia movies and anime. It's beautiful action, crisp, clean and stunning visuals, great storyline, sensitive music, and most of all, it's heart -because the makers clearly put a lot of emotion in it-, make this series an all-time classic which is an obligation to everyone who's interested in gangster-films or anime. This series is, without a doubt, top-notch. Because I also forget to mention the dialogues, the great screenplay, and in-depth characters.P.S.Watch the subbed Japanese version, the American dubbed version is somewhat out of shape in the plot. The Japanese dialogues are more subtle and seem to fit more in the series.",
        "Animes are known for their dense stories, touching emotions and exciting plots. Gungrave is a fine anime!The story starts off slow, picks up pace, and reveals a story of two friends entwined with ambition, love, betrayal and revenge. You may guess how it is all gonna end, and yet not want it to end that way.The last episode still gives me chills. The story grows on you, and you start relating with the main characters, rooting for them, hoping for a good amicable end.Story wise gungrave is awesome, decent action, but then it ain't action scenes that make this anime unforgettable. It never is.Short 20 minute episodes, 26 of them, good for an extended weekend watch. Highly recommend. And it gets better with some whiskey ;)Enjoy!",
        "No Doubt, one of my favourite anime series I ever watched. A class. Definitely, one of the best.",
        "No matter how much you try to change your core remains the same.",
        "May contain small, non-significant spoilers. Finally, I've just saw the last episode and I am feeling strange, kind of like a person after being tortured. I won't lie, this anime do have some interesting points, a bleak lights seeing through the darkness of the infantile. This show is definitely not for the grown people. But lets start over.Friendship, trust, family, love, brotherhood, loyalty, total control and betrayal. Those are the basics, the main themes explored in this anime. Harry and Brandon, best friends since their childhood, are going to experience some dramatic stuff in their life. Starting as a small hustlers on the streets, they are becoming members of a very strong and influent crime syndicate. Soon they have a key positions inside, but from here everything can go only down, into the grave. First warning sign for me was Brandon Heat. It is very problematic to have the main character being silent most of the time. Language is a weapon when used properly, but the only weapons Brandon uses are guns and fists. Which is OK but pretty soon it is becoming empty and hollow without the talking. His lack of ability to do so, or probably intentional decision not to speak, is very annoying. It doesn't makes him more cool, it makes him more stupid. Not able to express or to explain himself, not able to talk to the girl that wants him, blindly following some idiotic syndicate rules and people, making sacrifices instead of profits. There are no real questions or doubts, no selfish behavior, no real feelings for him, only to serve and to obey. He is an autistic tool used by others, he has no real personality. As a heroic idol, as admiration icon - he is dumb. I can't respect dumb hero, no matter how brave and dedicated he is. The second sign, more clear and exact sign for the upcoming failure, is the women in this show. There are only three main female characters, and they are the most superficial, most dumb, most worthless and most unnatural characters in anime ever. It was real shame to see each and one of them. There are no real issues that occupies those women, they are plastic toys with stupid smile, a constant victim, a mindless decoration. No will of their own, no needs, just waist of color and animator's work.*** Aahhh, Faye Valentine! You are the only one of your kind. There is no competition here for you. ***And I think I found the reason the first episode and the second half of the series are so bad in the eyes of many Gungrave viewers. It's Mika. Every time I saw and heard this demon child, all I could think about is how can I grab her and choke to death over and over again. It is unbelievable how irritating and annoying she is. I don't have enough words to describe my disgust from this creature, this Antichrist. Please be aware and ready, long exposure can do lethal and irreversible damage. And of course, the last warning sign, more exactly the last confirmation how bad this series is, it's the story. I've seen a lot of anime. I know it is mainly for the teenagers and children, but the beauty is, that grown people can find really mature stuff in it. Thus we have so many anime for adults (no, not hentai). It's the total freedom of animation, the unlimited fantasy, the lack of limitations and boundaries of reality, that can add so much depth and interest into animation. Not Gungrave. The story is very simple, very clear, many clich\u00e9 moments. When you see some sparkle of complexity, some dramatic or even tragic conflict, just before you wonder how does it get here, you realize - this is actually retarded. Because of the context, because of the pointless and the banality of this story. This show is not a smart one, it is ridiculously childish.And something positive for a change - action scenes are not so bad and can be nice to watch. Spilled blood and the killings are more or less realistic and believable. Some of the characters are creative and imaginative on the first impression. Some of the events are nice, some of the moments are surprising, and overall you just watch it because you want to know how it will end. Would you enjoy the ride? Not really. But I guess it depends who watching it.*** Some recommendations for better anime:The series: Cowboy Bebop, Berserk, Ninja Scroll, Samurai Champloo, Outlow Star, Yu Yu Hakusho, Reign: The Conqueror, Last Exile, Bible Black, Black Lagoon.The movies: Wings of Honneamise, Perfect Blue, Roujin Z, Memories, Vampire Hunter D, Steamboy, Lupin the 3: Castle of Cagliostro, Mind Game, Kite, Ninja Scroll, Akira, Paprika. There is more, much more.",
        "Amazing anime, amazing story and build up and then a perfect ending for it...I have no complaints whatsoever. Full of feels and a solid built story, too good that it feels underrated cuz it didn't make a big hit I guess..but if you haven't seen this awesomeness anime yet just ignore the 8.1 rating and go watch it cuz it's much better than that...would 100% recommend this!",
        "I make this short.On the bright side it has a brilliant, perfectly told and unusual story with an ending that surprises but satisfies. Interesting characters, too.Unfortunately it also contains a lot of tackiness, has quite a wooden animation that makes the emotionless characters look the most convincing (Brandon, Bear) and some of the most shallow, ridiculously over-emotional female characters ever will get on your nerves.So: Watching it is absolutely worthwhile but not at all times fun to do.",
        "Gungrave is a brilliant anime. The construction of the story, the characters, and the motifs/themes are all outstanding. When I watched this anime I was addicted after the 3rd episode because of the story and characters. The anime plays like a revenge tragedy, a Doctor Faustus of sorts. Except the way the story is told is all jumbled up which reflects back on the mind of the character Beyond the Grave. The entire anime reflects the mind of Beyond the Grave and in the end we understand and know who he is even if his actions sometimes confuse us. By doing this we see the past that lead Beyond the Grave to revenge in the same way that he remembers the past. We learn with Beyond the Grave what cause The Organization to become corrupt. And the evolution of the human psych drives us to watch further and deeper understand the relationship between the characters. These characters raise questions, motifs, and themes that make the viewer realize that The Organization is more complicated than the mafia may have first looked. Motivation for sins, for betrayal, and loyalty are core concepts in this anime and by the end there will be more questions than answers. But the anime closes as nicely as it unraveled with the story clear but the implications of the story sticking with the viewer long after it is over.So far all of that is outstanding but the anime does falter in the actual animation. There are times where the animation feels forced or awkward. That being said it hardly takes away from the experience and will probably be only a slight annoyance in the beginningOverall I gave Gungrave a 10/10 because all together the simplicity and precision of the anime overall the slight imperfections.",
        "although i came across many animations but the moment i watched this animation it somehow felt very real and indeed the truth about life has been revealed in this animation.Man i cant even think of something else but of gun grave.A Real TRAGEDY of life.truly a real one and the worst one i have ever seen in my entire life.i pay gratitude to the director and to all the group who made it.they really are great. i hope they make many other animations in the future which are not so tragic but are about the same caliber.the action and the protagonist should be the same type but the slope of tragedy must less steeper.well the only thing that i want to say to the directors is to do their best in making such animes in the future also.",
        "Gungrave is about two friends in a small gang. When the rest of the gang is murdered, the only two left are Harry Macdowell and Brandon Heat. In an attempt to get away from their past, the two friends join a mafia organization by the name of Millenion. After many many years in Millenion Harry begins to get dangerously ambitious. When he asks Brandon to come with him on his ascension to the head of Millenion Brandon refuses. In his blind ambition he kills Brandon and so begins the rampage of Bloody Harry. Its now 15 years later and Brandon has been revived through Necrolization to become the ultimate Gun-toting anti hero, Beyond the Grave. Out of the blue, the daughter of Brandon's old love interest Maria appears and reveals the truth of Grave about what happened after he was killed. Now, Beyond the Grave is locked and loaded and ready to dish out some old fashioned justice to Harry and his new violent Millenion. Beyond the Grave is ready to fight and has one mission, the kill Harry Macdowell and his new Millenion. I love Gungrave. The characters are interesting and the action isn't repetitive (some people might consider this a drawback). The voices are perfect, and the show is simply a successful attempt to interest the players of the games. Gungrave isn't a popular anime, and its less popular a game. This gives it a lot of appeal to me, I don't have to hear about it from the majority of Otakus.Gungrave is a less popular show from Yasuhiro Nightow and the Madhouse gang ( creators of Trigun ). Although the show isn't as popular as some of the other animes it is just as good with a dark and dreary look. If you loved Trigun and Hellsing and X and (well if you are an otaku) I highly recommend this title. English dubs are affordable and have four episodes on each disc. You can order the entire series or you can order the entire series, on ebay or the official site, with ONLY Japanese DUBS. Volume 4 is due on January 18. Be sure to look for it.",
        "I saw the reviews and the ratings and thought I'd give this a go, and noticed a VERY disturbing trend on IMDb boards- Otaku Anime-Chan's are giving every anime out there a 7 minimum, and most are at a 8-9 regardless of how horrible it is. This, of course, is one of those.It starts off wonderfully, with great excitement and an awesome storyline! Cool guns, and questions you want answered (don't worry they won't be until ep15 or so), and a cool lead character who again isn't shown until the last arc of the storyline(in the form you first see him in).Enter Episode 2....absolutely nothing like the 1st, even seems to be a different world or timeline entirely. Has NOTHING to do with the first episode, and it remains this way until the VERY END OF THE SERIES! You could very literally skip all the way to 17-20 (out of 26!!!) and not miss a SINGLE THING due to the snail's pace of the story(not even story just endless rehashed filler) and the fact that NOTHING RELEVANT HAPPENS UNTIL THE END! They could be two separate stories, two separate animes and it would have been better.No neat gunfights other than a few, with only two which are noteworthy. Again most of which are in the last few episodes.This show is too blatant a ripoff of scarface, and the stuff they added in to make it watchable disappears after the into and doesn't reappear until the end of the series. This is unfortunate, because it had some potential to be cool.Every character is a clich\u00e9, every story predictable, and in case you don't understand a point, don't worry because it will be flashbacked and rehashed at least 4 times.I really wish I could get the time back I wasted watching this and put it towards a good show, or game, or outside breathing air...anything really. Want guns? Watch Trigun, Trinity Blood, or any of the other gun-slinger animes, but skip this one! It even makes the mafia seem boring (unlike, say, Cowboy Bebop). Point of fact...would you watch it if the cover art was a few guys in business suits lookin all mafia-like, and the name matched the show, and it was called Tha GodfathaZ (with a Z since there's zombie-wannabe's in this),...probably not. If so, then by all means, this is the show for you!",
        "I really enjoyed this anime series, it did a good job of keeping you interested about the story and it's characters. To be clear it wasn't anything I expected though, considering it was created by the same group that made Tri-Gun. Tri-Gun was good, but wasn't great, this on the other hand successfully fixed all of the problems trigun had and if you watched trigun before watching this series they won't even seem vaguely similar. One of the most interesting thing that Gungrave does is tackle multiple characters by presenting them all as good guys, so it's up to the audience to decide which side they support and who they are interested in. There are a few clich\u00e9s but nothing that makes the series boring or seem uninteresting. The pacing is actually quite nice as well. In each episode something that progresses the story is happening and is concluding. With that being said you have to start with the first or second episode to fully enjoy the story. If you miss an episode, you might want to wait until you see it until moving to the next. Character development is this anime's strongest point though. As said before it presents all characters as good guys in their own way. The ending however is the best I have ever seen. No cliffhangers either. Because of the character development and watching the characters grow seeing the ending end the way it does is heart breaking. The hardest part about writing a review for gungrave would be not adding in any spoilers. There's so many interesting topics to debate with this show."

        "I have to say, Lelouch definately acts like Light from Death Note on this. I absouletely like him as a character because he is just darn clever and does have what it takes to get what he wants. The way hes able to control people and the way he is really a sneaky b*stard, makes you think the likes of some of our world leaders today! Yeah it really hasn't changed in this century, if you're reading this review in the next century folks then you would understand what we went through lol! While I don't think the anime is the best but Lelouch does have you on your toes with his evil mastermind plans and you could see also his soft side because of his sister who couldnt walk or see due to PTSD. It really was sad that both their mum died and having the sister witness it from her eyes, then suddenly become blind/unable to walk because of it. Lelouch really is a caring brother and thats what I like about him more to the extent as a character.Well done Johnny Yong Bosch for doing such a great performance as Lelouch!!!!!!",
        "In the year 2010 Britannia declares war on Japan. Which removes japan from having their own rights and freedom and they are addressed as a number known as the 11's and Britannia gains rights to everything.Lelouch as a younger boy promises to give Japan it's freedom and create a happier world for his blind and disabled sister nunnally. While Suzaku has his own story and joins up as a britannian soldier because of a sin he has done.Years later he meets a green haired woman who look really young and beautiful but has lived on immortally young for years gives him this power called geass. This ability can give the user rights to control anyone and to do their bidding. This seems like a cool ability that anyone would want but there is a huge price to pay after overusing it. So, he becomes the anti-hero known as Zero.This is season 1 it is really good and had a pretty good turning point which I honestly did not expect.In the second part after the events of Season 1 his memory gets altered and lots of things change and things happen which never actually happened in his memories. Also in this season there are even more plot twists and surprises which you would have never expected.This season was also very good but not as good as season 1.In story wise it is very confusing at first but you eventually get used to it.Voice acting wise Johnny Yong Bosch, Yuri Lowanthal and Kate Higgins all did a pretty good as their characters. I watched an episode in Japanese and it was pretty as well.There is also another series out there by the name of The Akito the Exiled this series good, well not as good as the actual series but it did a good job at explaining what is going on between R1 and R2.This anime is definitely not for kids as there is lots of violients, strong language and nudity within this anime. I am generally not a fan of animes with server nudity but I gave this one a chance but luckily however this anime was on Toonami once and it was mostly cenored and anywhere online is also censored. However, Funimation and Bandai released some DVD's which are uncensored and you would get the option to watch it in original japanese with subtitles or in English.If you love anime's which have good mech fights and handles drama, comedy, love, tragedy and action then I would definitely recommend Code Geass.",
        "Code Geass is one of those medium-pushers, particularly for anime, that invests in its selected medium to the absolute limit of its capacity; its animation and story are simply stunning with hardly a wasted moment in sight and no wasted time exploring its own self-invented alternate history, continuing the greatness of its predecessor 'Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion: R1'.Code Geass is one of those fantasy stories that introduces so many alien concepts yet the characters are so relateable suspending disbelief for this saga makes it all the more like seeing an age-old piece of Mythology discovered and unraveling before our eyes for the very first time. Despite all the robot-suits and Star Wars villain-esque get-ups worn by the baddies in the show, we feel for the protagonists and their fight against the Brittanian Empire and want to see them triumph.Code Geass R2 is one of the finest animes to be made in the 21st Century, and by far one of the most thematically complex ones to become such an immensely popular cult-classic, if not more-so than that status I just gave it.Code Geass is the show that's turning non-anime fans into fans right now, and for good reason. It's something more than your typical anime romp; it's a new genre.",
        "YES MY LORD..... YES YOUR HIGHNESS..... YES YOUR MAJESTY!!!And I finally finished Code Geass. As an anime, this is nothing sort of a masterpiece.Season 1 was a great introduction to the series. We got an introduction to the philosophy and background of Lelouch, and why he hated the world. There's also a buildup to the character of Suzaku Kururugi, and the dynamic between Lelouch and him was an interesting one. The plot was not too complicated, as I felt this was more of an introduction that set up the series. The action, although wasn't as focused as the plot, was still good and the designs for the mecha were cool. However, the best thing was seeing Lelouch performing feats and charging forward. The ending was a big cliffhanger, but I enjoyed it overall. 8.5/10Now season 2 is where all the pieces that were set up in season 1 came together. Due to other things, I didn't watch season 2 right after 1, but the introduction to season 2 got me right back on track.Plot-wise, there were LOTS of major players involved. However, none of them felt wasted, and almost all of the characters had a purpose in the overall scheme. Even though it might get confusing at times, I was hooked to the story and found none of the episodes boring.The dynamic between Lelouch and Suzaku became more intensifying, as each had to battle with their philosophy as well as setbacks in their paths. I loved their development, as well as the humanity that they had to cast aside for their own goals.There was almost like 2 endings to this series. The first one was in episode 20 or 21, and I felt a major homage to the last 2 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The emotional impact wasn't strong, but it became a major turning point to the end.The real ending was bittersweet, and i was incredibly satisfied with it. The endpoint for the main characters, especially Lelouch, made sense, and it made Lelouch one of the best protagonist that I have watched. The ending also showed major theme about the cost of war, peace, and freedom, including sacrificing one's humanity.On a side note, the ending of Attack on Titan really resembled this ending, but AOT is still a masterpiece in its own way.Overall, I adored the complex storyline, character developments, and the bittersweet ending. Truly a masterpiece. 10/10(Also almost got tricked thinking that the 2019 movie was a sequel to the anime. Felt like if it was it would ruin the beautiful ending of the anime.)",
        "Interesting anime with a good ending although I wish god I found some episodes too slow and philosophical. It seemed that the series wanted to give itself a tone of importance that it could do without. There was already a lot to think about without trying to take more than necessary but the writers wanted to exaggerate.",
        "While this sereis was interesting, the storyline was very chaotic. Lots of characters thrown on the screen to process. The flow of the series is very erratic as well. Still worth a watch though.",
        "Rating 7.9Tsuiraku no sut\u00eajiA ton of fun, a ton of flaws, with a unique ending, (dubbed the \"Lelouch Ending\"). Most flaws stemmed from events happening because the plot needed them to, not because they remotely made any sense. IMO this is slightly better than Death note because at its worse (holes and all) it was still entertaining, while at Death note's worse I had to force myself to keep going.",
        "After Japan has lost the war against Britannia, it's now part of Britannia with it's new name \"Area 11\". After his mother gets killed by terrorists, Lelouch swears to destroy Britannia and that he gets something called a \"Geass\" seems to be a useful weapon to achieve his goal.Code Geass brings out a more than strong character with Lelouch.Insecure at first, Lelouch quickly develops into a narcissistic but dutiful character after he gets his Geass.How Lelouch uses his Geass is also well thought out, as he can only do it once on each human.But because Lelouch is a genius, he naturally knows how to deceive and manipulate his fellow human beings.",
        "I had heard of this and heard lots of good things about this before I had saw the first six episodes of this at Animethon 14 yesterday. Not many people have heard of/seen this show since it hasn't been released into North America yet, but if it ever does get a wide release- I recommend everybody checks it out.Filled with tons of action, blood, and witty humor, Code Geass takes place in 2017 Shinjuku, where Britannia has declared war. Lelouche Lamperounge is a Half-Japanese prince of Britannia. He is long believed to be dead. He has secretly lived, making plans for revenge against assassins sent by Royal relatives for killing his mother and crippling his sister. He is a military genius, but that dosen't help the fact that he's a powerless high school student and orphan. One day, he gets caught in a Terrorist Act's crossfire, tries to help a strange woman named CC. She grants him powers. Now, he has all it takes to be a powerful military leader and lead in the crusade against Britannia's attack.Code Geass is awesome- Action-packed, lots of blood (I.E. The mass suicide in the beginning, when everybody shoots themselves, blood LITERALLY rains out of the wound), funny as all hell, and amazing voice acting is to be found too.If you ever are able to get ahold of this classic rare gem of an Anime, go for it. It's awesome, and it's the best anime I've ever watched. I hope to watch more episodes some time. Totally recommended! Rated 14A for Violence, Gory Scenes, Coarse Language, and Non-Sexual Nudity. (Canada- Animethon 14 rating)",
        "(No Spoilers): Code Geass is one of my all time favorite Animes and one of the greatest in my opinion. This will be reviewing both Seasons.Plot: Code Geass follows a high school student called Lelouch who is extremely intelligent and regularly plays chess and gambles. After been given what is called a \"Geass\" he is able to control others, but may only use it once on the same person. Using this power he becomes a masked hero and leads a rebellion against the Britannia Empire.Code Geass is basically a mecha anime, but it's also political thriller. The animation style is kinda weird at first but soon you'll get used to it and the mecha fights are great, but that's not what makes this series so amazing. This isn't just a mecha anime, in fact I completely forgot it was until making this review. This series is unbelievably thrilling, and honestly it didn't need mechas to be entertaining. Lelouch is a fantastic lead, he's basically a prodigy and plans the entire rebellion basically on his own, and it's really cool to see how he thoroughly plans everything. In some areas it does sometimes seem like he is overly smart, and maybe it could've been toned down a bit, but the show fixes this by actually having him make multiple mistakes throughout the series which greatly affect his plan.A lot of the series follows him trying to continue his life at school and leading the rebellion at the same time. The parts at the school are probably the slowest and weakest of the entire series. It's not bad at all, but it slows the plot down and wasn't entirely necessary. His friends in school vary from being common tropes to actual characters. Shirley is probably the best of the bunch. While she might seem as the cliched love interest at first, later on in the show she becomes a fully fledged character and brings for one of the best parts of the series. Lelouch's best friend Suzaku is also fantastic. Lelouch's and Suzaku's friendship has a great role in this series, and is one of the best parts. Kallen who is an important part of the rebellion was also great, and one of the most badass characters. I just really enjoyed her. Nunnally, Lelouch's blond sister, brought great character moments for Lelouch, and what happens with her also brings for one of the best moments in the series(no spoilers).This series has the characters react in very realistic ways, the rebellion have arguments, friendships are broken, characters are killed. There are several plot twists which made my jaw drop, it's very unpredictable and engaging without having unrealistic twists. The first season is already amazing, but the second season brings it all together and makes it even better. It has a very satisfying conclusion which ties up most of the plot points. This show is amazing and it's a must watch.9.7/10",
        "Code Geass is a show centered around magical powers being secretly used to stage a rebellion against a tyrannical empire. This show has some of the best characters in any anime I've ever watched. With stellar music and animation, the show pops with this futuristic punk and royal atmosphere. The story is great and only picks up, ending on one of the best episodes of anime. Of all the anime I've watched that are older than a decade, Code Geass is one of the best anime of its time.",
        "This anime is so completely UNDERRATED!!I am saddened to think I almost didn't watch this series.. it got put on the shelf as more & more new animes kept appearing & I became so late to watch it, as its been many years since it came out.. but better LATE then never!This series is like The Gundam series in the way that it has mobile giant mech machines being piloted for war called Knightmares.Its got excellent visuals, as well as an impressive array of characters that advances the story along very nicely.The storytelling is what separates this from other anime as even certain episodes that may feel like it lacks much action will end up being very exciting & epic that you forget all about whats lacking.The creativity & vision used in presenting this elaborately well designed story will keep you entertained because at times you are not sure who really should be the antagonist or protagnist because at many different moments you may sympathize with 1 side or the other, while also understanding good or bad is subjective to each of the viewer themselves.Imagine this anime being like a labyrinth, sometimes you go left, right, forward, backwards, sometimes you go in circles or try to cut through diagonally, well this is exactly how i felt while watching it because it takes u on a wild ride that makes many storylines come full circle just when you may have thought the creators forgot all about this or that story.The way the different storylines were tied together was genius & I for one (I'm the biggest fan of Gundam my #1 favourite anime) feel this anime is able to compete with Gundam animes in both action & storytelling.Many twists and turns await you as you watch this anime and I hope you enjoyed this Anime as wonderfully as I have.",
        "Code Geass Lelouch pf the Rebellion is about a 17 year old boy named Lecouch who gets a mysteros power named Geass which is aalble to control the thoughts and opinians of anyone who looks into his eyes. With his new power, the exiled prince of britannia vows to take down the leader of britannia, where he aims to create a world of light and hope for his little sister. A world without war, discrimination and injustice. I watched the firsr episode of thisbshow a few yeara back and sisn't really like it at all. I wanted it to be darker. But the firsrt episode didn't hook me at all. So I ignored it. Until I started to see how much praise peopmw gave the show. I got the ending of the show spoiled. So I knew what the fate of a certain character. But Indisn't know how it lead uo to that, so I gave the show a watch and watched past episode 1 and OMG, thia show is AMAZING. It is like if Death Note and Fullmetal Alchmist had a baby together. It really feela alot like those two shows, but it's different enough and more original foe me to not care too much. Leloucb is possibly on of my favourite main characters in anime. He uses that intelligent brain of his, combined with the geaas and you have this really skilfully, tactical man. Even the other main charactera like Suzaku, Colin, C2 are all so AMAZING. The animation, for a 2006 anime still holds up today. I cannot belive this show came out when I was 9 years old. It still looks AMAZING. The soundtrack is very good. There was nothing I really hated about this show, but maybe in terms id my mixed feelings, I would say the voice acting. I am quite split on this because when the englisb dub voice acting is good, it is really REALLY good. But when it is bad, it is really REALLY cringe bad. I would say the voice acting of Lelouch's little sister is possibly one of the WORST acting I have heard. It makes me cringe every time she speaks, although her actinf gets a tad better. Also, the pacing of the show seems a little too fast at times. I mean, there are some BIG revelations and suprises that happen and you dom't even have time to soak in what has hapoenes because it just foes on to the next thing very quickly. It's ironic because I loved the Naruot series, but the pacing was sooook slow, it felr like the show disn't get anywhere. But with this show, the pacing was so fast and snappy, you can't seem to enjoy certajn things. So if the pacing waa inbetween slow and faat, this could have been a perfect show. But, thoae are just my mixed feelings of it, overwise, a suprisingly entertaining show, with great animatiom, sounstrack and a grwst plot with deep messages. I 100% recommend giving thia show a watch, especially on blu-ray. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe",
        "Its not a bad anime. There is action, some drama, and an OK plot but lets face, it is insanely generic and clich\u00e9. The good news is that the plot is good enough to keep you watching. For folks who like action anime and justice/revenge plots there is enough here to make you want to see how it ends. The characters, as generic as they are, are likable enough to want to see how their story ends. But that is really it. Here is the bad...The use of amnesia is too convenient and plain silly. The struggle between main characters has been done to death and back in shows like Gundam Seed, and Scryed not to mention movies and books. Their struggle here is definitely forced and the situations that pit them against each other is extremely weak. The politics is just laughable. I mean... bad leaders are common but the problem here is that the leaders are doorknobs. Its unrealistic that they maintained power long enough to have an empire. There is a reason why our dumb leaders today cannot accomplish anything meaningful... by definition of being dumb, they are unable to succeed for very long. Then you have blind faith characters, forced tragedies that are more unlikely than winning the lotto, ridiculous romance side plots, bad guys who are insane from power, etc etc.Overall, its above average but I it could have been better. I have a feeling that the author will likely get better over time so I look forward to seeing more work from them as they mature.",
        "His enemy is not just one villain, but a whole empire, one man is about to change it all...Code Geass is one of these epic sagas which stand out ... I could put this anime on a list with such franchises as Star Wars, Matrix, Babylon5, Death Note and Game of Thrones with a good reason...What do these shows have in common ? Storytelling! A very creative story about the struggle of a certain group of characters led by one revolutionary person who is determined to overthrow a regime sometimes at the price of his life...Code Geass is Star Wars of 2009 that very few people have seen... Action, unexpected plot twists , complicated characters, the wish to change the world...If that is the sort of stories you like, it's a must see...",
        "You know, there are boring shows, there are over the top stupid shows, there are shows with lame characters, but this one is just that bad that i don't even know where to start. In this show every event happens randomly, and every character appears randomly as well, no one gonna tell what is going on(well, i suppose no one knows, cause it is just senseless, empty and ill-conceived). But it is just one of it's huge problems. Characters 0/10, no one is interesting at all, they all just goddamn idiots. Third problem is stupid behavior of the characters(happening among stupid action). Fourth problem is a try to sit on both chairs: to be \"epic\" journey and entertaining funny show for kids(with fighting robots kekw). And spoiler: it sucks in both. But the main of this series gaping wounds: there is no point of interest for the viewer at all, neither on local level, nor on global. I don't wait anything, and i don't want to(and also i can't imagine what can any viewer want except \"big britania fight\"). For 13 episodes my count of interesting moments never left zero mark, but my negative meters were all screaming like Geiger counter non stop. Well this is definitely one of the worst thing that i've ever watched, one of the most overrated, not recommended to anyone.",
        "This is a very average show which has been much overrated. Problem with this animation is - the episodes seem repetitive and the plot doesn't move forward much, there are too many loop holes. The story is not well paced, the characters are not someone you will like as they have too many issues and they seem so indecisive.It does have a lot of Mecha and really great fights among them with war and military strategy's going on. Their is the element of mystery and suspense which last till the end in a cliff hanger ending. It even has super godly powers and stuff. Have i left something out...ohh yea it has romance angles and tragedy. In trying to do too much they ended up with a nothing specialI did actually really enjoyed some of the episodes and the brilliant twist and turns it had but the characters and the sometimes silly plots spoiled the overall experience.",
        "I found the first season overrated but wanted to finish the story so watched the second season. It was worse then the first. Atlest first had strategy and tactics going for it. My problem with the series is it has gone over the top with the everything, too many plots and twist which does not add up. You have super powers and then super weapons to suppress them. Everyone seem to be working for the same thing which is World peace but its they who want to being it about. None of the characters are likable. Even the whole them of the plot changed midway.I did like the ending..it was so clich\u00e9 but still awesome. That's the only thing i liked in the second season.",

        "If you told me Code Geass sucked, I wouldn't even flinch. There's too much going on, and a lot of it falls flat. Its a mecha anime, its a high school one, and it has aspects of fantasy. Its serious, its funny, its ecchi. It has feats of genius, and feats of pure power fantasy. It has, no joke, dozens of plot twists. More than a few of them come out of nowhere, and one of them is among the worst plot devices in history. Plot points have unsatisfactory answers, accelerate three times too fast, or get bogged due to clutter.F it. I'll still support this show. Its pretty fun, it has some great suspense, generally good pace, and a few emotional scenes. The characters are mostly likable and three-dimensional. Lelouch, our lead, develops, and has moments of sorrow and heartlessness. And the action is top-notch. These knightmare frames are fast! And no battle is a push-over. Some of the plot twists are mind-blowing, too.A lot of people love this anime. I know more than a few who dislike it. I can't say you should check out the first episode to decide, because that only breaches the surface of Geass's strengths and weaknesses. Regardless if you'll love it or hate it, its defiantly something out of the ordinary.",
        "I dropped this last year after watching an episode. My reason for this is that the animation looked weird. 1 year later, I returned back to this anime. Here is the review.Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is about an estranged 17-year-old boy that has been given supernatural power. He wants to find out about his mother's death and keep his sister safe. It is animated by Sunrise who also animated Cowboy Bebop and Gintama.The story of Code Geass Season 1 is mostly filled with fighting and school shenanigans. The anime has mechas and a lot of warfare, I didn't find it repetitive. The starting of the anime was sudden but when you discover Lelouch's past it makes sense. I personally didn't the school parts. They were used for comic relief and to show Lelouch's friends and how he struggled to keep his identity unknown. The comic relief was mostly filler and unimportant. The fanservice was very cringy but good for bonding. I would like to know more about The Chinese Federation and E. U in the Second Season. Overall the story was good.Lelouch Lamperouge is the main character. He's quite the stereotypical protagananist with a revenge story and wanting to find out the truth. C. C is another important character. She is cold but loyal to Lelouch and thinks well of him. Kallen is one of Lelouch's important soldiers. She is quite annoying a decent character. The characters in the Britannian army were ok. I thought that they got too much screentime and that the Japanese side should have got more, I thought the romance plot with Villetta was pointless. I was not interested in his classmates that much of which Shirley and the girl with glasses were my least favourite.The start of Code Geass season 2 was disappointing. After a suspenseful ending, it's revealed that Lelouch lost his memory of being Zero and of his Geass. We are introduced to his new brother Rolo and to a arrange of characters with their memory stolen. I found the 1st half of S2 repetitive and boring. When the 2nd half happens everything gets going. The pacing is faster, there is more character development and more action. Lelouch, the protagonist is the most anti-hero propagandist I've ever seen. He's extremely well written and unevenly distributed as the most important character. C. C is my second favourite character. Her character bloomed during the season and instead of being a spectator (like in the first season), she has the power to change things and act by her moral compass. The romance plots were very boring.The animation was quite good. I thought that they looked lanky and stick figure-ish was weird but I got used to it. The character designs were alright. The fights were rigid sometimes. The animation was quite good. The OP's and ED's always looked really good and the action was OK.Season 1 OPs were amazing, Season 2 were pretty dissapointing but saved by good animation. I watched the Sub and the voice acting was very good. Sometimes it was pretty emotionless but I found it great. The ED's were lackluster and forgettable. The soundtrack was good.In conclusion, This anime was fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone who likes an antihero protagonist and I will watch the remaining spinoff movies.",
        "This anime is incredible, the story and characters are perfect. You should be watching it.",
        "How I got into it: When I first checked out this series on Adult Swim on Demand,I have to say out of all the anime that Bandai Released,and created,this show is far out good. It was like Gundam in a whole different way. This series was so awesome I had to get it.When I got it: When my big brother got me the first 2 volumes in a set on my 26th Birthday,and the other volumes on my own,it was just like watching it on TV again,the show was really inspiring and it had a great storyline,and it had some good music.Favorites: My favorite characters in the whole show are Princess Euphemia,Lelouch aka Zero,and General Tohdoh of the four holy swords,and C.C.Meaning of the series: What this series also tells us is that wars are very rough,and it is kinda hard through the tough times. And friendship is also another key factor in the show.The series had a great voice cast with the talents of Johnny Young Bosch,Michelle Ruff,Kate Higgins,Yuri Lowenthal,and others.So if you want to see something good,then this series is the one to watch,and after this season,see the next one. It will get better.",
        "What got me into it: When I checked out the trailer of this chapter of Code Geass on the final volume of the previous Code Geass. I have to say after seeing what the next chapter is going to be like. I had to continue watching it.When I got it: When my Big Brother bought me the first volume of this chapter on my 27th Birthday,and I bought the others on my own. It was totally amazing,and I've really enjoyed it. And of course the storyline was different than the previous chapter.Difference: I have to say the difference between the 2 chapters that the first chapter has the first knight mare frames,and later in the next chapter the same knight mare frames,and new ones. And of course some of the characters in the first chapter,and some of them in the next chapter. And new characters in the next chapter.Characters: Favorite character in the show are:Lelouch aka Zero,Suzaku,Todoh,Dietard,Li Xing Ke of the Chinese federation.The voice cast: I have to say that Johnny Young Bosch has a great voice for playing Lelouch/Zero,and Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers) playing the voice of the Emperior. And also to the show introducing Spike Spencer as Rolo.So if you have seen the first chapter,then watch this chapter. It's the best,and you will love it.",
        "Don't just read long reviews, if you're fan of badass characters, amazing action sequences, terrifying plot twists and emotions just watch this Masterpiece. I bet you won't regret at all.After the last episode this anime is a best for me."

    "Puella Magi Madoka Magica": [
        "As this series begins protagonist Madoka Kaname is having a strange dream featuring a mysterious black haired girl; the next day at school a new student transfers into her class; Homura Akemi... the girl in Madoka's dream. Things get even stranger when Madoka and her friend Sayaka meet a strange cat-like creature called Kyubey; it makes each of them an offer; he will grant each of them any one wish in return for them becoming magical girls and fighting witches. These witches are unseen by ordinary people but their actions drive people to despair and suicide; only the chosen magical girls can defeat them. Madoka and Sayaka learn more about magical girls when they meet Mami Tomoe, a girl who has already become a magical girl. As they get to know her and understand what it means to be a magical girl they try to think what their wishes will be... one person is determined that they won't make a contract with Kyubey; Homura Akemi who is in fact a magical girl herself.I had heard that this series was something special long before I watched it and feared the hype would be difficult to live up to; especially as I'm not particularly familiar with the magical girl genre. As it happened I was hooked from the start with the strange nightmare visuals in Madoka's dream which turn out to be those of the witches' dimension. I'm glad that I had followed the advice to avoid spoilers as the series evolves in a way that reveals much of what we have been told was misleading; this leads to a series of reveals as the true nature of the magical girls is revealed to us and them.If you think the magical girl genre is just for young girls then think again as much of what happens in this series would give children nightmares; every day brings chances of death and despair; the cute art style just serves to amplify just how tragic things are at times. The story progressed nicely with the various reveals being spread through the series in a way that meant we'd just come to terms with what one meant for the girls when another was sprung on us. At only twelve episodes in length there is no time wasted on filler material. In case you haven't guessed I thought this was a really great series that every anime fan should watch.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "At first, I thought that this anime was going to be something like Sailor Moon or Pretty Cure, since the artwork and the characters designs looked cute and colorful...However, against everything that I was expecting, this series was actually pretty dramatic, having several dark plot twists (At least in comparison with what normally could be expected from a magical girl series)Fortunately, this series is also very interesting and well made, having an unpredictable plot, good action sequences and excellent animation (Being the most impressive aspect of it the strange and surreal appearance of the witches and the witches \"otherworld\", which apparently had some inspiration from Russian and Czech animation, giving it an appropriately nightmarish appearance) The contrasts between the cute aesthetic used for the characters, with the darkness of some of the sceneries (and several parts of the plot) is pretty effective, keeping a good level of mystery during the whole series. The plot moves very fast, avoiding any kind of shallow or filler material, something that helps very much to the overall rhythm of the story.In my opinion, the conclusion was satisfying enough, fitting with the overall mood of the series, giving an appropriate glimpse of optimism without being something corny or patronizing.Even if \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" isn't the best anime ever made, I appreciate as a different kind of magical girl series, which is able to use some of the most common archetypes from the genre in order to create a fascinating and unique series, which was surprisingly much better than I was expecting.",
        "I've came to this show with high expectations, especially after hearing the dark element that everyone was talking about, but this one was just fine for me. It's a nice story, with the magic girls saving the world by killing witches. The story goes further than that, with the girls experiencing death, despair, hopelessness, heartbreak and such. The main character experiences major character development and the mystery behind that long haired girl who tries to save her was intriguing. But, the action scenes were so so and the art was a bit odd and not my cup of tea. So, 5 out of 10.",
        "I finished watching this recently but literally, it was such an emotional rollercoaster! I would never expect an anime that has the magical girl genre to be so dark! So far, I haven't seen good magical girl series but boy, this is up my street!Definitely give this one a watch folks if you need a \"wow\" moment or even a cry, it is sad ! Enough said lol...",
        "I got exactly 14 minutes and 38 seconds into episode one before quitting. It extremely boring. There is no visual style other than everyone having a squashed face for some reason. I know that character development takes a while, but none of the characters are even the slightest bit interesting. The few conversations happening are boring. Everything about this nothing ball is just BORING!",
        "I thought this show looked fairly childish and girly, which it was, until about halfway through the series. Once you begin to realize the sinister things going on behind the scenes, each episode continually surprises you more and more until its final conclusion. This still doesn't make my list of top anime series, but it is one of the rare anime series where I am completely satisfied with the show's conclusion.",
        "One of only a handful, at most, anime that manages to be truly meaningful and thematically rich. As an allegory it has a lot to say about how women are treated in society, and at how heroic that struggle against it is. But it also manages to be the least of a cop out when trying to embody abstract concepts that the genre always attempts, such as hope, as well as situating that into a nuanced context. All while not having everything just be a deus ex machina.It's honestly a heck of a feat. Even the art, on second viewing, manages to impress. I remember not being very into it years ago, but now I think it's genius and fits really well. This has to be in my top 5 best anime of all time. Though, I'll confess I am not as well watched in it as I was in my youth. But rarely has anything, anime or otherwise, affected me as much as this did.",
        "An anime filled with a huge amount of hard, a well thoughtout story and beautiful animation that tackles friendship, hope, devestation and loyalty.A wonderful anime. 9.2/10",
        "Rating: 6.8This is a rare example of something with good writing: (they explain most major lore questions even if the answers are bad Kyubey literally said magical girls defy all explanations when commenting on their origins) that is just lacking in the engagement department. It just felt meh. Madoka's character was stale up until the last episode, and I just didn't care about anyone besides Homura and Sayaka. There are also notorious plotholes such as Homura letting Kyubey live initially despite having the ability to stop time, Sayaka saving Madoka despite not knowing where Madoka was, world governments not doing anything about magical girls despite Kyubey stating they literally evolved humanity and have been around since ancient times (so magical girls existence isn't a secret), Madoka's mom letting her \"brave the storm\" in episode 12, ect..I tried something new ended up not liking it.",
        "It begins very cheesy, as Urobuchi described as a healing series, however, what occurs in the first two episodes has the only purpose to manipulate your expectations. After the third episode the shows true nature begins to creep through and only in episodes nine and ten that the full nature of the whole fictional universe is revealed. Truly a marvelous piece of entertainment and also a work of art. Its a very rare accomplishment, a TV series combining artistic value and entertainment value.I never cried watching TV, I never felt so affected that I was unable to sleep, but Madoka managed to affect me on a very deep level that no other TV series (including Evangelion) has ever managed to match. It set a new standard for what I came to expect from television: brilliant writing, memorable characterization, over the top visual style.",
        "I have never seen a magical girl anime that was so good at mixing cute, innocent characters with dark storytelling, and I still managed to enjoy this even without seeing other Magical Girl shows of which it is a darker version, like Sailor Moon, which I will totally watch after making this review. Madoka Magica works as a subversion because it does something new by putting your typical cute innocent magical girls into dark situations, but you can feel for them when you know their desires and goals. I'm not a fan of dark and gritty anime, but when Madoka Magica still works for me because it can pull it off by being so compelling and engaging, then you know it did something right. I love the characters Madoka and Sayaka, and when I watch this again I will definitely pay more attention to Homura. However, I find It very odd that Kyoko only debuts after Mami is gone when they should both be main characters in this show, but I guess they are not as prominent as Homura or Kyubey. I actually think that the Star vs. the Forces of Evil episode Baby was a reference to the Kyubey from Madoka Magica, while the title character's design is a reference to Sailor Venus from Sailor Moon, as they both have a long cape of golden hair.In shows with short seasons like this one and Good Girls, you can easily get lost if you don't watch all episodes in order, you might forget what the main characters' end goal is as they delve deeper into more dark situations, but it's still riveting to watch nonetheless because you want to see where the story goes. It was also very fascinating how the credits change with the tone of the episode, like playing Eversion. Episodes 1 and 2 have a light, happy feel with Madoka and Sayaka hugging, Episodes 3 through 8 and 11 have a much scarier song with Madoka turning into a witch, Episode 9 has a somber, tear-jerking emotional song with Kyoko holding onto a drowning Sayaka, and Episodes 10 and 12 are the same as the show's opening theme. That reminds me, you should really watch the 10th episode before watching all the other 11 episodes in order, and it is the first time Mami and Kyoko are in the same episode together. Mr. Enter really got me into this show when he announced an admirable review of it in Animated Atrocities #158. At the time of this IMDB review, Enter still has not done an admirable Puella Magi Madoka Magica review yet, and never has for 600 days after this review. I also like how Christine Marie Cabanos and Sarah Anne Williams, the voices of best friends Madoka and Sayaka, were both relatively new to voice acting when cast for the English dub in 2011, when Homura and Mami had more experience being magical girls, and their English voices Christina Vee and Lauren Landa had more experience with voice acting before Madoka Magica.",
        "This is top tier quality anime, Puella Magi Madoka Magica has every right to be as popular and famous as it is. It is the inspiration for one of my favorite genres of anime, it's characters are memorable and are authentic, making us hurt when they are hurting, making us smile when they are smiling, and making us cry when they are crying. The story is well thought out and very put together, the soundtrack is amazing and the animation is top tier! This is an all-time favorite that is one for the books!",
        "I've been hearing many good things about Madoka Magica for a decade, so I finally decided to give it a shot. I definitely agree that this is a truly excellent and unique show that deserves the highest praise.Not that everything is perfect. I needed quite some time to get used to the untypical animation style of the characters, which appear (even for an anime) rather young. Thankfully, there is none of the typical oversexualisation, so yay for that. Another just as large issue is that Madoka Magica does start out with its rather generic premise: middle school student Madoka gets offered to become a magical girl to fight evil abstract beings called witches. And for the first three episodes, that's pretty much what's happening.The ending of the third episode proves that this show isn't the kind where the magical girls all go home to victoriously eat ice cream at the end of every day. The intensity picks up even more over the following episodes until the second half of the twelve-episode show remains truly excellent. The characters are all wonderfully fleshed out, the plot is interesting and well thought out, yet there a none of the anime-typical silly tropes and somewhat uncomfortable ovsersexualisations (I'm looking at you, Neon Genesis Evangelion!). There are a lot of surprisingly emotional moments in this show, along with impressive cliffhangers, a thorough sense of dread, overwhelming wholesomeness, yet also a generous portion of realism.Except for the style of the characters, I found the visuals rather stunning. The depiction of the abstract 'witches' was at times a bit... interesting, and at others positively gorgeous. The soundtrack also has some nice things going. I'm not entirely sold by the English voice cast, perhaps due to their squeaky little girl voices; this might be yet another anime you'd prefer to watch with subs.All in all I found this highly rewarding. Plus, it's the kind of show you could possibly even watch with your conservative relatives... maybe.",
        "It's always really something special when you have a show that comes along that totally misleads you in a very good way and I think this was the textbook example of how to do that. The first two episodes is essentially world-building. It slowly but effectively pulls you into this story and immediately after that, it does a complete 360 with the ending of the third episode.I do find it interesting how it takes the concept of the magical girl and humanize it in a way that can implement a sense of realism. Every single one of these characters go through a conflicted journey and whether it's tackling their own self-beliefs or morale, the creators make sure that is showcased front and center.The plot might have been what hooked you in but the story was what kept you watching.",
        "When I first heard about this series,I have to say that a lot of people have been getting into it. I have to say that after seeing people dressing up as the characters at Anime Cons,this is a show that I wanted to see. After watching the series on crunchy-roll,I really wanted to own it. But after buying it on DVD,and watching it in English,it feels like watching it on Crunchyroll again. It has a great storyline,and the characters were amazing,and the dimensions where the battles take place reminds me of .hack//sign. But what this series reminds us that we should be careful on what we do. We all need to take responsibility on our actions,and never be reckless on what we do. I do believe that the Magical girls in the show have tried to be careful on what they do,and what fate they have. But however,this is one of a kind,and I think you all need to get this show,it's the best.",
        "I don't know why I liked this anime so much, but I did and that's what matters.",
        "The deconstruction of the Magical Girl Genre of anime has become one of this years smash hit anime series as well as another personal favorite of mine. Puella Magi Madoka Magica jumped to be my favorite of the winter season and most likely it will go down as my all time favorite of 2011. My interest in this mostly stemmed from a like of Magical Girl Shows and sealed by Yuki Kajiura's involvement because when she makes the music you can't go wrong.First impressions were \"yeah okay they have all the magical girl tropes Yuki's music is good enough; hey where's the ending theme?\" but the show for sure got more interesting when it got darker by episode 4 and considering Mami was for sure not coming back from the dead in any kind of deus ex machina as well as the torment the other characters go through as the series progresses.This is one of the darker Magical Girl Shows I've seen, I guess I should have expected it from the creator of Phantom of Inferno (adapted into Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~) as for the director Akiyuki Shinbo, who I'm not overly familiar with but I did some reading on him. From what I gathered all I was really expecting was some artsyness which made me go \"oh cool an artsy magical girl show.\" But again wasn't expecting anything overly groundbreaking and invigorating.After episode 10 Home Run Homu Homura-chan easily became my favorite character from the series as well as one of my favorite anime characters of all time. The fact she continued to reset time and try to save Madoka only to have to watch her friends die over and over again....She's got moxy! Really that can't be healthy....The other characters even managed to stand out as well. You have Sayaka who loses it when the one she loves and makes her wish for goes for another girl, the bomb drop of the purpose behind the Magical Girl, Kyoko's own tragic past and Mami's as well. Sadly perhaps the only character who didn't get as much attention was Madoka however I will give praise for the fact she had to wrestle with the idea. While she is the titular character it becomes more apparent afterword that the series is really told from Homura's point of view.As I mentioned before one of the reasons I jumped right on this as opposed to waiting was Yuki Kajiura's involvement. Ms. Kajiura who has written solid classics in the past such as the .hack// OST, Noir, MADLAX, El Cazador de la Bruja and Tsubasa Chronicle once again was able to step up to the plate. The music is wonderfully written but suffers from a few generic pieces in the mix. You have wonderful tracks with a strong emotional grip which can evoke the images of the series but you have the dull everyday tracks which feel more like scratch. If I had to rank it with some of her past works I'd put it with Elemental Gelade which was a good OST but not one of her very best either. Regardless the OST is more than worth a look at especially for fans of Kajiura's music group Kalafina which delivered the stunning ending theme \"Magia.\" The art and animation will strike you a bit strange with a combination of unusual designs. Even I wasn't sure of what to make of the cotton balls with mustaches as well as the acid trip design scheme for the Runes. Each Rune gets more elaborate and strange as the series goes on and many are quite creative. Sayaka's witch form which takes the environment of a full symphony orchestra is a brilliant example of environmental symbolism. Homura's apartment alluding to her time manipulation skills. The art direction is solid even of the characters designs look sketchy and unusual. You have a mix and match of landmarks from around the world from a glass prison to a giant oil refinery to a wind farm, this will be an art student's orgy.Of course things got complicated for enthusiastic watchers during the 2011 Northern Japan Earthquake and Tsunami putting the anticipated finale on hold but happy to say it was creative and daring. The series almost reconstructs itself on the spot with Madoka's final wish and creatively shows Magical Girls from around the world.Puella Magi Madoka Magica easily one of the best series of the season if not of all time. The same way Hideaki Anno's \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" deconstructed the Giant Robot Genre. Shaft/Aniplex's Madoka deconstructs the Magical Girl Genre. And like Evangelion this series is quickly becoming a marketing and franchising juggernaut with toys, even books talking to fans of the show including acclaimed filmmaker Mamoru Oshii, shops and other materials dedicated to it.This is the first deconstruct of the Magical Girls genre of anime that I have seen personally, I don't know if Princess Tutu or Akiyuki Shinbo's other magical girl series \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha\" falls into that. Puella Magi Madoka Magica doesn't fall into a lot of the old traps seen before and it doesn't try to model itself too much to other successful series in the past such as \"Sailor Moon\" or \"Cardcaptor Sakura\" though it certainly plays with the staples established by those series.If there is a sequel and there are talks of one, I wouldn't mind a reconstruct but it would be nice to keep it relatively dark and dangerous. Hopefully no earthquakes will complicate things this time and hopefully it can be as good as this, the original.",
        "I started watching this knowing nothing except that it was a 'dark' magical girl series. I've never seen any of the magical girl stuff (unless Claymore counts?) so I had no idea of how it was using/subverting the usual tropes. Still, it was pretty amazing... and very dark. By the time I got to the 9th episode I was feeling pretty distraught over the fates of all the characters and how awful the whole system was. One thing that particularly stood out for me was the animation and the various styles to represent the bizarre Witches and the Labyrinths they create. While the main characters usually remain in regular anime mode everything else becomes a wild collage of symbols and strange creatures that symbolize the Witch and her obsessions. Each one seems to be a mysterious story unto itself. Don't let the cutesy character designs fool you though... this isn't for kids, both because it's so disturbing and also because I don't think they'd really understand it once the true nature of the magical girls starts to come out.",
        "i really liked it, despite it being about young girls...the only other magical girl series I've watched is sexy magical girl which is a crazy hentai...this was nothing as mental as that...i had heard this was very dark, and i didn't think so to begin with, but maybe i was thinking 'dark' in terms of horror, which this isn't really, it is 'dark' in terms of despair and hopelessness...its actually a very intelligent, well thought anime, that had me guessing up til the end and keen to watch every episode...Madoka meets a strange creature that looks similar to a small dog, with long ears that talks (it is anime, so that is not as weird as it sounds!) named Kyubey. He offers to grant any wish she wants in return for making a contract for her soul, to fight witches for the rest of her life...what will her one wish be? awesome animation, interesting characters and a gripping story, but probably too deep and possibly disturbing for younger viewers (theres a lot of trippy imagery in this!)...its pretty awesome...",
        "What would you give for any desire you could think of? *Note: I've seen the entire TV series & the sequel movie \"Rebellion\". I put this title off for months because every time i'd see the thumbnail for it, its these cutesy magical looking girls and my thoughts were how bad and stupid it would be, i was so wrong i wish i watched this when it was recommended to me! This anime really makes you think on such a deep level, its so beautiful from artwork to story line. Lets start off by saying this is NOT your average \"magical girl\" genre, its not some PG crap child aimed anime. This show is definitely for the older audience. There is so much substance in this show, its very hard to go into detail without spoilers, so lets talk about the music. The songs and audio for this show are amazing, you can just feel every scene so perfectly. The artwork is some of the most magnificent drawings I've seen from any anime, from the perfectly detailed city's to the amazing detail to the designs on the windows & side walks its all spectacular but what really blows me away is the labyrinths, every time they enter a witches lair the world becomes all trippy. Quite literally if you've done larger(?) amounts of acid at once(by yourself) then you'll probably find the visuals even more amazing because it captures exactly what being on large amounts of acid is like. This show is amazing from the first episode to the last movie(rebellion), it will surly stay in your heart and will remain a favorite for anyone willing to give it a shot without prejudging its \"girly/cutesy\" look.5/5: Why perfect? Watch it(the movie too) and find out, its one of the few who earned perfect. I can't think of anything bad to say. The movie also has about twice as much trippy-ness as the TV show. **For those who've done acid, i'd say 3-4+ hits done by yourself would be enough to understand what i mean about the visuals of the labyrinths. Why do i say by yourself? When tripping with anyone and become completely alone are two completely different things and you probably haven't touched the vale if you haven't tripped in your own solitude.",
        "I watched this show when I was younger and only remembered it as a masterpiece and now I rewatched it after years and I can still feel the same emotion as if I were watching it again for the first time.I can remember the feeling deception the first time around and I believe that this show is unpredictable the first time for everybody. The first few episodes are little boring but once you watch the whole 12 episodes and rewatch the first few episodes you realize things have been in place foreshadowing the truth since episode 1.It's a bit hard to recommend a show with an art style like this to friends because it really does look like a magical girls show and in my opinion it is, however it has a lot more depth than the typical magical girls show. Speaking of art style, I absolutely think the art is amazing and so meaningful. They get so creative towards the end of the series and character design is very appealing as well.Plot, the plot of this show is basically what caused this show to blow up to the degree it had. Going into this show blind is the most enjoyable experience.Music always hit, production knew when and how to implement bangers.Symbolism. There's a lot of images, a lot of dialogue, a lot of \"actions\" that have great symbolic meaning, and nothing is spoonfed to you but it's all there for your own speculation.Overall this show has so much uniqueness, definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen or heard anything about this show. It's a great ride.",
        "The packaging is definitely off brand for the series. The cover art and opening music theme portray a series that looks like it'll focus on teen romance and relationship drama. And magic i guess. The show then becomes a journey into fantasy/sci-fi and fatalistic existentialism. The art is interesting, as various scenes into the witches' territories are a bit psychedelic. The story was a bit loose and jumbled, but it evolved with enough interesting concepts of mankind's place on earth and in the universe that it kept me sufficiently entertained through the end.If you're expecting this series to be the greatest series ever or a masterpiece due to the other reviews, well, don't raise your expectations too much. I guess it might be, depending on your taste, but if it isn't, well, you can always throw Death Note or Food Wars on standby.",
        "I have never really been a fan of the \"magical girl genre\" of shows. They have never really seemed interesting or enjoyable. But one of the few magical girl shows I have been able to watch is \"Madoka Magica\", one of the most popular in it's \"genre\".Madoka has gotten a lot of praise, and I can see why. It really changes how the \"genre\" was seen in a unique way. Making a seemingly kid friendly show into a fairly dark thriller can be very interesting. It also never seemed like it ever tried to shock it's audience. I heard that the third episode was supposed to \"change everything\" but i found that the tone was kept pretty consistent over the whole show. Sure, it is pretty dark in the end compared to the first episode, but it was never jarring in the way I found re:zero to be. The tone slowly becomes darker and darker, but never too dark to make it feel \"edgy\".\nBut while I can praise it for it's concept, especially for it's time, I can't say I enjoyed it as much as the general public seemed to.While I found many aspects of the show to be fairly interesting, like how it comments on what it means to be human and how there isn't an objective good or evil, I can't say I enjoyed a big part of the show. The show was never consistent with it's quality in my opinion. I could be really interested and invested in one episode, and then be really bored in the next.\nI could never decide on what I thought of the show cause it would always change. And as a consequence to that, I found a lot of the story to be very forgettable. You can say how many deep themes or characters as you'd like, but the fact that I didn't find a lot of the show to be very enjoyable remains. It may change my thoughts next time I watch it (If I ever do) but it doesn't do anything about the enjoyment I already had (Or lack of it).And I just want to mention the ending. At the last few episodes we learn that Homura, someone who has seemed very cold and unlikable, is revealed to have traveled back in time several times to change Madoka's fate of dying in the battle with Walpurgisnacht, a story of which we have seen several times but that I found fairly interesting anyway.\nBut the consequence of making these new timelines just to save Madoka made it so that the whole universe centered around her. And in the end when Madoka becomes a magical girl, she becomes a god.\nWhile I found it interesting how making a timeline just for one person made the universe center around that person quite interesting, the moment Madoka became a god, she wasn't a character anymore. Madoka, an already pretty perfect person, becomes the ultimate perfect. She has no flaws, she isn't human and I can't relate to her in anyway anymore. So while it was interesting how she became more powerful the more timelines there were, making her a god made her a worse character in my opinion.\nLike I said, this could have to do with one of the themes. How there isn't an objective good or bad. That a good thing could become a bad thing (The whole concept of the magical girl in this universe is kind of a metaphor for this). Madoka destroys earth in the process of killing all witches (I think that happened at least, I was kind of distracted the whole time. Please tell me what actually happened if I was wrong) which shows that even though the wish of killing all present and past witches was good, it's consequence was bad.\nBut they also never talk about it more than that. They never go into too much depth, of how it is impossible to be perfect, even though Madoka became a god. She is just a god, and is perfect and therefore her choice was good (Which is kind of was happens with christianity and other religions in some cases...).In general, I found the show to be kind of forgettable. It was fairly enjoyable when I watched it, but I don't think I would ever rewatch the show if I don't have a good reason to.\nSo yeah. I think I might give it a 7 or 6 out of 10. A 7 for now at least.Hope I don't get put on blast for this...",
        "The concept of Madoka Magica in its essence is the same as any other of the Mahou Shoujo genre, what impacts is the way it is treated, addressing a message of maturity and loss of innocence, this becomes memorable compared to the others.It is not necessarily the first Mahou Shoujo to deal with adult themes, but it is the best when working on the turning of a script, it is not for nothing that the anime became known for establishing the \"rule of the three episodes\", proving that to have understanding about the that work is really about and has to offer, this number of chapters seen is necessary.In addition to being beautiful in its art direction and symbolism, Madoka Magica brings a fluid animation and unlike any other anime seen before, more precisely when the main characters face their enemies with unique characteristics.What could be just another difference has a direct impact on the work, since it feels like being out of place and vulnerable, and not only in these magical worlds, but also in the physical world, the anime shows an empty immensity, in spite of being beautiful.What can irritate many who watch it is the one that gives the title to the work, Madoka is the typical fairy tale girl, who always seeks optimism and romanticism in the most tragic situations, but just a careful look is enough to understand that this despite carrying the anime name is an observer and driving force of the script, Madoka could be seen as us, the viewers, who are as confused and frightened by that situation as the same, leaving the highlight almost entirely for the other characters in the story .Madoka is much more than a subversion of genre and script, this anime must be contemplated for its character construction that differs from the majority, placing human situations in fantastical universes that end up being in the background when compared to the drama of the characters.Highlight for the composition of the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura that has become a jewel in the anime world, with just a few seconds in our ears we are able to recognize its singular characteristic, and remember the exact moments when it is presented in the series.",
        "Madoka Magica, unlike many other magical girl series, offers a new viewpoint on the magical girl anime genre.Madoka Magica is known for being a dark magical girl series, while still keeping that magical girl feel.Although being a short series, with about 12 episodes I believe, it's amazing and even has 3 movies, as well as spin-offs.Normally, I'm more into brighter magical girl series (Sailor Moon, Precure etc). However, I actually really liked Puella Magi Madoka Magica. The art style is beautiful, the main characters are very likeable and the story line is incredible.It would be a crime to not watch this. You NEED to."

        "This anime is so hard to watch like its about a group of 5 people who moved with their lives and not be friends anymore because of the 6th person they had in the group tragically died from an accident. Then afterwards we see the group finally connecting together and then the spirit of the 6th person disseapears but is still watching over them. When everyone was crying that they'll never get to hear their friend again, I failed at not trying to cry. As well as this, Classroom Assassination and Clannad: After Story were the saddest anime I've seen so far and like it does open your eyes!Really great anime like it deserves the best saddest anime award definitely!",
        "I watched this anime in English as I always have a preference of dub.This anime is truly amazing and inspiring. I just finished watching all 11 episodes and I can tell you this I never regretted one bit.At first it had a very slow start and I was having second thoughts on whether if I should drop it after the first two episodes or not but as a continued watching I am just glad I didn't stop.The art style and the animation is truly unique. It bodes well with characters as the move and talk. Also every part of the background is very detail you would not find any parts incomplete or wonky as the shows.I would also like to add on that the theme song for this anime is interesting and it adds a refreshing filter to each episodes. The music also fits the scenery very well.There are many like able characters and of course the few comic relief. We get to explore many different themes such as jealousy, grief, friendship and learning from past mistakes and we can become a better person. Which is the strongest message this anime has.The voice acting was very good Griffin Burns did an outstand job as Jinta.My final words: watch this anime you won't regret it.",
        "The animation is good. The characters are good. It's only 11 episodes so it doesn't stretch out overly long. But the story/directing was changed too much from the original concept and near the end became a predictable pot of emotional mayhem.That's its flaw: the final episode becomes far too heavy rather quickly, and is an emo-fest from the beginning to nearly the very end. Yes, it portrays a good moral concept, but it is trope city. I suppose one can't blame an anime for using tropes, because that's one of the standards of what makes anime what it is. But it could have had more of a surprise ending. Instead it has all the flavor of typical Asian films: the main characters pouring out their hearts to each other and the audience, and like a tidal wave it's too much and too sudden.It's not that we weren't presented hints of this throughout. But that's the thing: it's like the director said \"Here, watch us fill this bucket\" throughout the series, and then suddenly pours the whole bucket on the audience at one time.The story relies very heavily on the concepts of ancestor worship and reincarnation, to the point that both concepts become a major plot device. Some may find this objectionable. But it is an Asian film so such is expected. In this case though, it struck me as somewhat over the top. Much of the story is rather heavy-handed, when more subtle mystery and mystery-revelation would have worked better as a plot device.Would I recommend it to others? In this case I'd have to say no; it's just too excessive in several areas to form a well-rounded story. I liked some of the characters; others were uber-cliche. The highly-predictable exactly-as-you-expect-it ending is somewhat anti-climactic. I give it 6 stars as above average because of some of the enjoyable characters and initial presentation, but because of the increasingly heavy story and plot devices can't place it among the top animes.",
        "The second anime I watched from A-1 pictures. Truly one of the most depressing yet uplifting story. The premise was not really new, but there was still unique elements to it. The first 2/3 of the plot was the complexed development of the 6 main characters and their relationships. Although they were childhood friends, certain event to one of the member drove the group apart, yet created a \"peace\" between them. Throughout the story, they all had to break this \"peace\" and move on with their lives. Because of the great developments of these characters, the ending of this series became tear-jerkingly painful. The anime, with its execution, sent a powerful and hopeful message about friendship, confronting personal trauma, and most importantly, moving on from the trauma. Absolutely beautiful animation and characters. 9.5/10.",
        "Rating 4.8Favorite Episode: N/AAnnoying and average, the whole story could've ended in 2 episodes if the protagonist did you know what to prove to his friends you know who really came back.

        "I started watching this anime having pretty high expectations, hearing that is emotionally touching and that by the end I'll be crying. And here I am having felt nothing...The premise seemed interesting enough to give it a shot, but gradually the anime was becoming a giant mess with no characterization for the people in it. I didn't even felt i knew these characters by the end of the anime. But the biggest problem was Menma herself for me and the lack of backstory for her. She was 9 episodes out of all the 11 of the anime only annoying and while I was midway through the series I was constantly asking myself, what's the point of this anime? Why am I even watching it anymore? There was absolutely no backstory involving her death or why the other guys felt so guilty about it. It was just like another season prior was missing. I was constantly asking myself this too: Why am I supposed to care about the story? There was zero effort in showing the reason she died, the reason they felt guilty altough there was enough time for flashbacks with the characters as they were younger. And don't even get me started on the whole ghost-Menma-thing who made absolutely no sense. I could go on and on about why it didn't made any sense, but I'll summarize in a few words: if you want to have a ghost that act differently (than how ghosts were presentented \u00een other mediums) in an otherwise pretty normal world you need to at least explain some basic rules about it, instead of just throwing stuff around at the viewer hoping that melodrama would cover up for it.In conclusion, I'm only giving this show a 7 because it had some fairly entertaining episodes with some moderately character moments, pretty good music and a good enough ending (although too melodramatic), but aside from that this anime is a complete mess all over the place. 7/10",
        "Beware: it's a heartbreaker - the uplifting kind, but still. Don't watch the last episode if you have stuff to do, it might emotionally compromise you for a while.I have watched this anime three times now (twice in original Japanese and once with an English dub), which is a lot for me. It leaves me in tears every single time. When I was younger, I would watch the ending by itself if I was really congested, and it consistenly cleared my sinuses right up.AnoHana tells a beautiful story, driven by memorable characters and the intricate drama within a group of estranged childhood friends. It's concise, only spanning eleven 22 minute-long episodes; I love a series that doesn't wast my time, and this one's total runtime amounts to less than 4 hours.AnoHana does suffer from the same follies that most dramatic anime suffer from: namely cliches, over-explanation, and preachy themes that leave people like me shouting at their TV's \"I get it already!\". There are moments during a pivotal scene where, in a needlessly explanatory revelation, the characters call themselves \"selfish\" and \"pitiful\" so many times that I found my eyes rolling even as they were filled with tears. Additionally, the premise is played with a bit too much, often to a plot-breaking extent, for the sake of drama. They try to address most of them, but clearly just for the sake of people like me, and I don't need to be pandered to.To be honest, all of this series' negative aspects seemed to be working their hardest to ruin my immersion, and they often succeeded; however, this series still had me crawling back a second and a third time to have my heart broken all over again. With all its faults, faults that usually ruin a cinematic experience for me, AnoHana still walks away from my critical gaze with a great score.",

        "This is one of the saddest slice-of-life anime I have ever watched. The main protagonist of this anime, Jinta Yadomi loses his childhood friend in an accident. For the next five years, he spends his life as a recluse, withdrawn from the society. Dealing with the loved one's death is never easy no matter what the age is. The anime is about how he tries to pull himself out of this misery and what circumstances he gets into as a result of shutting him off for 5 long years.Now without conflict, there cannot be a drama. There are quite few conflicts in this anime and these conflicts are presented and resolved beautifully. That's where this anime emerges as a winner. Communication is the most effective way to resolve issues or conflicts.The story has been told beautifully. We cannot help but feel sad for the characters. The last scene of this anime stays with us forever. Once watched, it cannot be forgotten. The anime has a bittersweet ending. We feel satisfied but it also leaves us heartbroken.This anime shouldn't be recommended to anyone. The others should be forced to watch it.",
        "Anohana is a slow-burn. It's a show that takes it's time with developing it's characters and progressing its story. It's not boring by any means and it doesn't drag, which is always great. It's just that there isn't really anything exciting that goes on, especially during the first couple of episodes. If you're someone looking for an exhilarating action-packed experience, this is definitely not it. But what this show does offer is a charming, insightful and touching look at how a group of friends deal with the grief and trauma of losing their friend, and how they help each other get past it and move on. It's quite beautiful really. The way the characters develop, their relationship with one another and their interactions between them is what makes this show so entertaining to watch. Anohana also reminds us that we should cherish our childhood memories and friends, and to also never lose our true selves - our essence. It definitely has it's sad and sentimental moments, but it also has some pretty genuinely funny moments that stand out as well.But, with that being said, the biggest problem I had with this show is that it tries a bit too hard to be sad and sentimental. It tries to force the tears out of you instead of bringing it about naturally. Unfortunately, because of this, it ends up feeling quite sappy and phony. By the end, it becomes so melodramatic that most of the sentimental moments end up becoming funny. Like how the 'Secret Base' song and sad piano music would play every time someone started crying, or how the voice acting would be over the top, or that final moment when they were playing hide and seek. It ultimately ends up feeling corny and forced. The other problem I have is with Menma. They made her character look too meek and childish. And on top of that, she comes off kind of annoying at times. I understand she's supposed to be a little girl and we're supposed to sympathize with her - which I do, I do feel sad for what happened to her. But I can't help but feel that if her personality and physical appearance would've been more mature, then maybe I would've been more invested in her character and would've cared more. For being considered one of the saddest anime and a certified tear-jerker, I feel like it didn't really live up to it's expectation or reputation. I honestly felt let down, like I got scammed or something lol. I definitely felt the feels and I could sympathize with the characters, I just didn't cry. Which is unfortunate because I was looking forward to crying. If they would've executed the sad/sentimental scenes towards the end a bit more genuinely instead of forcing it, then maybe I would've cried. Don't get me wrong, there are moments that are genuinely sentimental that make you reflect on life and the past, but I feel like these moments get overshadowed by the melodramatic sappy moments at the end. I did find the ending satisfying though. I like how they concluded everything on a sweet and hopeful note.Would I watch it again? Maybe, but I'd have to be in the right mood. Was it exciting and captivating? No, not really. But was it entertaining? Yes it was; I really enjoyed the story and following the characters' journey. Do I recommend it? Yeah sure, I can recommend it... lol.Style/Aesthetic: The art style and aesthetic are beautifully conceptualized and well thought out. The characters and the world have this sort of vibrant and cozy aesthetic. The animations are wonderfully fluid. They're unexpectedly intricate and creative at times.Story/Plot: The premise is great. It might feel like nothing really happens during the first episode, but that's only because it's used to setup the story and introduce all the characters. The show has a very character-based plot. It's a coming-of-age story about friendship and grief with a supernatural twist. The show has an air of innocence to it.Characters: This is what makes the show enjoyable. The characters are incredibly well fleshed out. Each one defined by their distinct personality and trait. They have enough depth, backstory and emotion to them that you feel invested. Each one stands out from the other. I love how they all bonded over playing Pokemon on their Gameboy's when they were kids. That was very nostalgic and relatable to me.World/Setting: The world feels cozy and welcoming - think Miyazaki, but more realistic-looking. The landscape shots of the city and mountains during the sunset were gorgeous. Very beautiful use of colors in this show. The sky looks like it was painted instead of hand drawn which gives it an almost surreal feeling. The world feels lived in and natural - it's beautiful.Dialogue: The dialogue is evenly paced. It's not fast and there's not an overload of information going on.Soundtrack/Music: The op is sweet, it sets the tone nicely for the show. The overall soundtrack is cute, feel-good and sentimental. Again, it does feel like the show tries a bit too hard to be sentimental at times when it doesn't need to. Like they'll just be eating food together and then the emotional piano music will start playing. It's the way in which they insert the music during certain scenes that makes it feel like they're forcefully trying to make you cry - it feels disingenuous. Almost like the emotions or the tears aren't well-deserved. So in this regard it does tend to feel kind of corny at times.",
        "Anohana is a show that I didn't expect me to enjoy as much as I did because of how much I really didn't care for the first episode of the series, but as the I watched the next 2 episodes because I give shows 3 episodes to impress me I started to fall in love with the characters and the story of this anime. The characters in this show are honestly so developed and by the end of this 11 episode journey you wish there was more because of how much you love these characters so good thing there is a movie that continues the story. The music is also pretty good from the amazing opening, closing, and the song that plays during the credits the music in this show is really good and also the score is pretty good too. The voice cast is also very talented and I thought they did an excellent job playing each of there characters. This show also has comedy but not as much as say your lie in April did but still this show had me laughing because of 2 of the main characters. The animation is also stunning to look at for a 2011 anime the animation honestly does hold up and it is honestly really pretty to look at. The message of the story is also really great I don't wanna say the message because it can easily spoil what the anime is about. Don't get me wrong is this a perfect show no, My biggest problem with this show is the first episode that honestly almost made me stop watching this show but I'm glad I choose to keep watching it because I really did love this series. Overall, I really did love anohana it's not my favorite anime but it's defiantly a show I did enjoy from the second episode on, and I do recommend you go on this journey you'll not regret it.",
        "The Story is too sad to begain with but have some thing that is turn point to the Comedy. It is package of everything.",
        "Recently finished watching this anime and absolutely will recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to watch it.The anime talks about Menma who died after falling in a river and Jintan being the only one who could see her then tries to tell the others about Menma showing up but at first no one other than Poppo trusted what he said and deep inside they all couldn't stop thinking about Menma as they all missed her and wanted to see her and not just Jintan, despite what the others said or whether they were angry or acted like they didn't care they all suffered and couldn't stop remembering the day Menma died and Menma could see they were upset in later episodes and the end was emotional when they all could see Menma and not just Jintan.The opening song and end credit songs are perfectly fit for this anime too and although I have seen clips of the end, I ended up crying and getting emotional, it's a really chill anime with no violence or gore but a really emotional and sad anime and it's amazing, hence the recommendation of this anime:D.",
        "I'm still hurting. This was amazing. I'm speechless. I can't even leave a proper review. I can only tell you to set aside time to binge it. It's so worth it.",
        "A girl comes back from death to spend time with her childhood friends. They have all grown up into high school and college kids but have all grown apart over the years. She comes back and brings everyone together again. It is a very sad story and it will bring tears to hour eyes. Don't miss this one!",
        "Emotional; Nostalgic; Well-Animated; Slow Paced; InspiringI legitimately was not super into this for the first few episodes, but somehow I found myself caught up in the characters, their interpersonal interactions and their story. I really love a story that makes me cry, and this one for sure exceeded",
        "\"We'll grow up. And as the seasons rush past the flowers blooming along the roadside will change, too. I wonder... What were the names of the flowers that bloomed during that season? They trembled slightly in the breeze, felt little prickly to touch... and when you moved your nose close to them, they gave off the dress scent of sunlight. In time, that scent will fade. And we'll grow, But... I'm sure those flowers will continue to bloom somewhere. Yes. We'll go on... granting the wishes of those flowers forever.\"Anohana is about a group of friends that get separated when a friend, by the name of Honma, dies and the trauma gets too much for them. We see how much they have changed over the years, and how it affects all the characters. But one day, Honmas ghost appears at Yadomis house, the main character. At first, he thinks that he is hallucinating, but he slowly realizes what is happening.The first episode gives us a pretty good idea of what happened the day that Honma died, but it leaves things so that the characters find out more of what happened. So even though the first few minutes doesn't do a great job at setting up that Honma is dead and not just Yadomis annoying sister (at least for me), the rest was great.As the show goes on, you get to learn more about the characters and their past. And because of that, none of the episodes feel unnecessary. Cause they either showed us something that would affect the show as it continued, or it hinted at something that would happen in a later episode. And that's something this show does really well. You might not see it first time watching. But if you rewatch it, then everything seems so planned. Like some of the animation that shows hidden feeling, that you see if you know what feelings the characters are hiding.But something I was surprised at was how it handled the dramatic elements of the show. All the ways that the characters coped with their trauma, all felt very realistic. putting on a facade, not getting over the past and regret are all ways that the characters cope with their emotions, and it's presented very realistically. But my problem with it though is that most of them cope with the same thing. Regret. Sometimes it makes sense, cause it actually had a part in Honmas death, but some didn't. One of the characters was very emotional about wanting to send Honma to heaven so that she could accept his apology but he didn't do anything?! It got a bit annoying when everyone was competing about who's fault it was for Honmas death. Cause there has to be other ways to be affected by trauma other than feeling like it was your fault. Please educate me if I'm wrong, cause I'm interested.My favorite scene in the movie was easily in episode 6 when Anjou comes back to school after what happened before. I don't want to say what happened, but I'll try to explain why I loved it. When Anjou comes into the classroom, you can see how the classroom starts talking about her when she comes in. And when you see her sit down and you hear everyone whispering about it, it really feels like torture. So when Yadomi stands up for her to take that attention to him, it really made me happy. It made Yadomis and Anjou's relationship feel more realistic.And then we get to the ending, which is what got me to watch the show. I had heard so much praise about the ending. Hearing that it was one of the saddest endings in anime made me curious. And even though I liked it, it was pretty disappointing.\nThis is where I'm going to talk about some spoilers. So here's your warning!\nI didn't get why everyone loved Honma so much. She wasn't very interesting. She just felt like the cliche cute little sister. She wasn't a terrible character by no means, but I didn't get why both Yadomi and Atsumu were in love with her when Anjou and Chiriko were both much more interesting. So when everyone started crying in the end, it just felt too melodramatic.There were, of course, other things I liked and disliked. Like the music that set the tone very well, the sometimes bad character animation (mainly when seeing the characters from a distance. It kind of looked rushed. Otherwise it was really good), and some inconsistencies in the story. But they weren't as important to me as the things I have already said.So if you haven't watched Anohana yet, I would highly recommend it! 7/10",
        "Pros:\nDecent story\nCharacters have a little depth\nEnding is touching and a little unexpectedMeh:\nWay too much crying\nA number of things are predictableCons:\nObvious plotholeThis is a sweet anime that is apt to make you cry. The storytelling is very good and slow as it is, it keeps moving. The characters to have some depth, at least as much as you can cram into these 11 episodes, though it is a little unreal.An obvious plothole is there were obvious ways to prove he was not hallucinating. Also, the amount of crying was a little annoying. Ignoring the backstories, the crying, and the plothole (which isn't hard to do), it's decent. I would recommend this anime if you enjoy tearjerkers.",
        "Now hear me out a little here. I know that to some of you that may have not watched the series but was able to hear or catch a glimpse of reviews about the plot story of this show will probably disagree with the title of my summary but seriously, please allow me to explain myself. While it is indeed heart-breaking that we are shown a story about a cute little girl dying from a tragic accident, the softness and pastel like color approach of this animation simply allows the viewers to feel the value of friendship and a subliminal message to carry on with life despite the darkness of the story itself. I think that this is indeed feel good animation movie that was based from the series. The Music and approach explains a lot once your able to finish the whole story in general.",
        "It's really heartbreaking at the end. But I really loved this series. I can't let Menma go. I just finished it. And the end of the final episode. I also shout that, I love you Menma! I'm in tears now, sorry for this foolish review. This is the best anime you should watch!",
        "Originally I was interested because I love shows and movies that deal with grief. However, each episode got harder to watch. I had a friend I was holding onto like in the story, and I wish so badly I could've had a genuine goodbye like this. It hurts and I was in tears as well. But it helped.In terms of the actual quality of the show, it instantly has made it to my top five anime. Highly recommended for all anime fans. No sexualized content, innocent, with a strong helping of tears and laughter.Thank you to the creators who helped me say goodbye to my dear friend.",
        "I find quite cheap when an anime evokes an emotional impact on its viewers by making all the characters cry and pour their souls out to each other... I mean, I could have handled it all if it were dosed correctly, but the amount of melodrama in this anime just exceeds all the appropriate amounts. Yes, the psychology beneath the characters is really complex and well elaborated, but it isn't the sole thing that an anime can stand on. There are also a few inconveniences and plot holes, alongside the fact that the characters feel \"love\" while only about ~11 years old... like, give me a break.I do, however, like the animation, music and the way the theme of letting go a deceased one was handled.Since the accent is on the characters and their relationships, the plot is kinda nonexistent; therefore it doesn't really do it for me. Perhaps you will feel different about it; after all, it's only 11 episodes, you've got nothing to lose."

    "From the New World": [
        "I saw this film at a private screening. I've read the book many times and I was very interested to see the modern adaptation set in LA. I was very pleased with the film. It has a cleverly written screenplay with an intriguing plot where nothing is what it seems. I was impressed with actors, especially Steven (Nathanael Theisen), who is very impressive, especially in the scene of delirium. The plot is great and just like Dostoyevsky did in his book, the director/writer also confronts the concept of the free will. The great thing about this film is that even if you haven't read the book you'll get involved in the plot very quickly. I recommend this film to Dostoyevsky fans, but also to all people who enjoy good cinema. I hope to see more from this director.",
        "Notes from The New World represents a wealth of classic wisdom thoughts brought to the fore by the producer.I particularly liked this movie because it takes us on a journey through contemporary culture and wisdom. Throughout the film, dreams and harsh realities of life, live side by side.The actors are definitely a strong point of the movie.Moreover, this movie faithfully describes many aspects of our society.Notes From The New World, is a superb adaptation of a classic novel by Dostoyevsky.The background music is superb!",
        "I had the opportunity to watch ''Notes '' (private screening) and I was really impressed.Honestly, there is a lot of our society that can be seen in this movie. It shows how people can be really alike in spite of their differences. It also helps to realize that the world has not changed that much.It reveals the deep feelings that we all hide. It shows the power of choice in life, and how it is hard to be who we want to be when the past is all we know. I really enjoyed this movie, because I could relate to what we see in society, and how opposite worlds meet each other.It has opened my perspective. It has helped me to see beyond the surface, and the often judgements we see everyday. After all, regarding our professions we are just humans trying to find our own place in this world.",
        "I saw this movie in a private screening and I really like it. Modern way of showing classic story of Dostoevsky looks unusual and interesting. Actors feeling them roles and acting natural, there are no feeling of fake imitation. Cinematographer job also looks good and it's pleasure for eyes to watch it. Duration of movie is not too short and not too long, you can get into story and to understand it. Also if you don't know Dostoevsky you can watch it like a separate work of art. And if you are a fan of Dostoevsky it will be useful experience for you to see this modern movie adaptation of novel. It's entertaining and unexpected work, full of interesting characters and locations. So I highly recommending this movie for people who has sense of cinema language and taste of good films.",
        "This movie is what the art of film is all about. It doesn't just present a famous literary tale--it refracts it through the prism of the camera lens. There have been several other attempts to present modern renditions of Dostoevsky's famous \"Notes from the Underground,\" but this movie takes it far beyond that. It's a story within a story within a story. After a stunning opening shot of Los Angeles seen from underground (the metro station), we're exposed to the amazing sight of none other than Dostoevsky himself, beard and all, tromping through the streets of Los Angeles. But as it turns out, it's not really Dostoevsky; it's an intense young guy portraying him. And what's driving this dude? Ah, there the plot thickens. Let's just say it's a world of competing agendas, of boxes hidden inside other boxes. This is one of those films that would take far too much time to describe; it just has to be experienced.",
        "I saw the rough cut of the film some time ago. It was a private screening for the industry guys in the sound mixing studio, in LA. Recently I've watched the completed film at the Marbella Film Festival, Costa Del Sol, in Spain. The movie considerably improved - honestly, I didn't expect the final version of the film to capture the essence of Dostoevsky this good.I'm glad to have seen the general idea of \"Notes From The New World\" being manifested successfully in the modern times and in a place like Los Angeles. The acting was surprisingly good and the build up of the suspense left me wondering what would happen after every scene. The scenery and cinematography were pleasing to my eyes. We don't get to see these kinds of films very often and I hope the director Vitaly Sumin has more projects on his plate. Overall, it was a delightful experience for me!",
        "I happened to see Notes From The New World some time ago when I visited Athens, Greece and was invited by a friend (a long time Dostoevsky fan) to make a short journey to a film festival in Corinth \u0085 I do recall that I was pleasantly surprised by liking the film so much. It was a clever, modern American adaptation of a European classic book with an intriguing plot where nothing is what it seems like at first. Back home I thought about this movie from time to time\u0085 There was some good acting and production design \u2013 especially the use of colors (particularly red \u2013 in different combinations) but more importantly I felt an enigma in it that I couldn't explain. So I've decided to read Notes From The Underground by Dostoevsky but couldn't manage to finish the book\u0085 I stopped in the middle then and returned to it just recently when I got a virus (probably in the gym) and fell sick and spent about a week in bed. Somehow I returned to the reading of \"Notes\"\" and this time was fascinated by the book. Evidently, it was easier to watch this film than to read (for the first time!..) the source (Dostoevsky's book) but after reading the book I thought that I understood the film better \u2013 it had the same depth of feelings representing a rich and complex picture of the absurdity and pleasure of our existence and therefore the movie was faithful to the book in this sense. That's how I recalled the nice time I spent in Greece with a friend and I recalled the movie that we both liked\u0085 I was curious to know what happened with it so I googled it on my laptop and found this page and decided to leave a note about my feelings. Unfortunately \u2013 while using Google again I couldn't locate a DVD of this film. Apparently the movie wasn't released yet. Will wait.",
        "My former girlfriend bluevelvet599 sent me a link to this page with her fresh review about Notes From The New World. She didn't tell the whole truth, or rather she avoided certain facts that I think could be of value for the film buffs. The truth is that right after the screening in the Corinthian-Peloponnesian film festival I was very angry with this film and hated it very much. Being myself an artist of partially Russian heritage and a Dostoevsky admirer I felt that Notes From The New World is a profanation of his writings and his philosophy\u0085 There's even a scene where the heroine, a former Russian actress who became a high class call girl in Los Angeles while being drunk, nicknames the great writer \"an angry old testament prophet\" and demonstratively destroys his portrait in a theater lobby\u0085True she was nervous and afraid of the Russian mafia killers who were after her\u0085 But why express her feelings (or rather the feelings of the writer/director of the movie) and in a so nasty way?!...On the contrary, bluevelvet599 had an entirely different opinion than mine. She claimed that I'm a conservative, a typical \"old European classicist\" (or something of this nature \u2013 which actually in a certain way is correct and was one of the reasons for us coming to Athens) who prefers the \"old world\" to the \"new world\" and don't see, or rather feel the whole picture, the deepest meaning of the film's values (she calls them now in her review \"the absurdity and pleasure of our existence\")\u0085 I told her that she has no right to defend the film without even reading Notes From The Underground (the book that the movie claimed is its source for the adaptation). Honestly, I doubt that at the time we visited Athens, being a typical representative of the computers/I-Pod based generation, she read any of Dostoevsky's books\u0085 In short, we had a fight. I angrily left the room in the hotel and had a long walk in the sleepy Corinth. I do recall that there were a great number of wandering homeless dogs in the nighty streets of the city. Some of them apparently wanted to befriend me, followed me and strangely enough managed to calm me\u0085 I then bought a couple of hamburgers in a fast food joint for the new friends and returned to my hotel. Using the computer in the lobby I found the site of Notes From The New World and watched the trailers and some related videos displayed there. Well,although I don't think that the trailers faithfully represent the film, rather they represent a similar sensitivity\u0085 But then something happened to me\u0085 I suddenly UNDERSTOOD that I\u0085LOVE the film\u0085 I do recall that something similar happened to me after the screening of Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\u0085 First I hated the film very much and then after about a year happened to watch the film on TV again and \u2013 using the biblical terms \"saw the heavenly light and was converted from Saul to Paul\"\u0085 or if you wish (using the expression of bluevelvet599) I underwent a transformation from Mr. Hyde to Dr. Jekyll\u0085 All in all, as far as the depth of feeling is concerned, Notes From The NewWorld is one of the most truthful adaptation/transformation/conversions of the inner values of the greatest book of the world cultural heritage I've ever seen. Really it's great to be alive! I would suggest to whoever isn't afraid of the Truth in regard to \"the absurdity and pleasure of our existence\" \u2013 go and watch this film whenever available. Back in the hotel in Corinth - I cut a couple of flowers in the inner garden of the hotel (nobody've seen this) and went back to our room. After I'll place this review I intend to give bluevelvet599 a call. Let's see",
        "When I received an invitation to the private screening of Notes From The World, I began to think that setting the story, which was based on Dostoyevsky's \u0084Notes From Undeground\", in modern Los Angeles might end with a failure. To my surprise, distance of thousand kilometeres and 21st century do not constitute a problem, due to the fact that motifs presented in the film are quite versatile.Moreover, the acting is definitely a strong point of the movie. The scene of Steven's delirium was convincing and reminded me of Raskolnikov's (a character from Crime and Punishment) such a state of mind, so Notes From The World might be related to other Dostoyevsky's novels as well. Hovever, even if someone is not familiar with Dostoyevsky's works, they will be definitely involved in the plot, which thickens every minute.I do recommend seeing Notes From The World, because it is another good example of adaption of Russian classics.",
        "I've had an opportunity to attend the private screening for this film. \"She is like a firework or a bomb!\" - This is my first impression of Sonia, one of the lead characters of the story (she's characterized as \"angel\" on the movie home page \u2013 www.notesthemovie.com) because she is not only beautiful but also unpredictable like terrorism. She causes the deaths of many people in Notes from the New World's story.For Steven, Sonia indeed may be a girl who combines in herself the qualities of mother and \"femme fatale\" or should I also say \"love and terrorism\". Is this is why she is a sort of a special \"angel\" for him? I must say that I do worry a little bit about Steven when he starts again his life with Sonia. So, the ending theme is very meaningful.As of this writing, I think we don't need to live underground to isolate ourselves. All we have to do is have cell phones. And indeed \u2013 now we could find many tweets from different Steven-alike guys on the internet. This genre-straddling film is about both the past and the modern things."

    "Dragon Ball Z Kai": [
        "Much more enjoyable with the filler removed, but the music change is a terrible decision. vegeta's theme makes all those scenes 100000x better (1 viewing)",
        "I am proud to be a fan of Dragonball Z. This perfectly captures the spirit of the series just like the manga. As someone who frequently goes to Books-A-Million, I managed to read all the Dragonball Z manga volumes. I didn't get the episodes of the show on DVD or anything. I just watched them whenever they were on. It was really hard to catch them all because there were just so many of them. It's also great that this version is uncensored. Then again, I heard it's STILL technically a kid's show in Japan.It's probably just a different culture thing. Of course, this might just be the fact that it's airing on Adult Swim. It's easy to see this classic series done at a much better pace. I still love the original series. They even managed to work a little bit of filler into this show. It shows how anime works and what it is in its raw form. As I haven't most of the original episodes of the show, this was a real treat. ****",
        "There are many famous anime out there and among the most dominant is none other than the Dragonball saga. While the first series simply titled \"Dragonball\" went for a somewhat more comedic route, this second series went all-out with the action and drama. Even though the franchise was not intended for kids, even the edited versions of this show were a ton of fun. get ready to power up because this is Dragonball Z Kai.What's unique about the second series is that you get to learn much more about the vague origins of characters like Goku and Piccolo. The storyline is more intricate and the action scenes are a lot more intense (and I mean literally planet-shaking intense). Things get really brutal and everything in sight gets blown away. I love that crap! It makes us all look forward to the next action scenes. Some of the characters are a load of fun too, like the ever awesome Piccolo and the delightfully despicable Vegeta, their personalities and interactions with other characters stealing the show. The villains are pretty cool as well like the sadistic Frieza and the menacing Cell, who instill terror into even the bravest of warriors.What I really like about this series is how dark it gets. In the original manga and the Japanese uncut versions of the show, things get really violent. Even edited, it gets dark with the serious dilemmas and numerous deaths that go around, which makes it more appealing to adults. I guess shows that go this route tend to be pretty successful like that.My only real problems (and they're not really a big deal) is some odd/exaggerated moments and a lot of the screaming. Other than that, this is one of the best action/adventure series and anime I have ever seen. This show is sure to give you one hell of a punch and it's guaranteed to bring out the super saiyan in you. Check it out. KAMEHAME-HA!!!",
        "From a personal point of view, \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" is one of the most entertaining shows on television. I will admit that I am not a fan of Japanese animation, nor have I, until recently, been an avid fan of the \"Dragon Ball\" franchise. I had a friend in high school who loved \"Dragon Ball Z,\" and I saw a part of one episode when it aired on Saturday morning on KTLA back in 1997. My local cable provider did not provide Cartoon Network until about 2002, so I missed most of what American fans saw of \"Dragon Ball Z.\" I had mixed feelings about \"Z\" when I started seeing full episodes. I found the serialized form in which episodes were shown---in the style of a soap opera---difficult to follow and to enjoy. You have to commit to watching the show for weeks for it to make sense. The villain could take fifty episodes to vanquish. Only serious fans could watch \"Z\" on a regular basis; all others would find the series tedious and boring. I liked some of what the show had to offer for a while, but found the long storyline hard to enjoy after several weeks.\"Dragon Ball Z Kai,\" which is an abridged version of the original \"Z\", is far more enjoyable simply because it has less episodes than the original show to follow. The fights against the foes seem to conclude more quickly and the plot flows much more smoothly. Much of what I like about \"Kai\" has to do with the voice over artists who voice the main characters. My favorite is Christopher Sabat's rendition of the villain Vegeta; this actor portrays the extraordinarily powerful super-villain with a confident, worldly, and cocky attitude, expressed with a raspy voice that emanates the sneering arrogance that defines the character. Goku's sweet-sounding voice is a stark contrast to Vegeta, embodying the former's nobility and innocence. Since the fights are more concise than the show's previous incarnation, they feel quicker-paced and are therefore more intense.While some parental groups may object to the violence of this program, it does have important themes and lessons to teach children. The heroes, in particular the main protagonist, Goku, do not win against their foes easily, and are therefore encouraged to persevere and work their hardest to win again against their enemies (the Wikipedia page on \"Dragon Ball\" enumerates the moral lessons one is intended to draw from the comic book in which \"Dragon Ball\" was published). When Goku is vanquished by his first enemy early in the series, he is undeterred, and, rather than giving up, decides to train harder than before to fight even more challenging enemies. The heroes' love for family and friends, as well as feelings of compassion for enemies, seem to overcome the lust for power the enemies have. Parent's ought to give \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\" a chance, and determine if there is merit for their children based on the themes stated above.Grown-ups may find this show rather unsophisticated plot-wise, and will find the fact that characters provide frequent exposition about plot developments to be annoying; in other words, the show tells you what is going on rather than showing it through action. I think adults will be drawn to \"Kai's\" action sequences, and these might make up for the forced exposition provided by characters. In spite of the \"telling\" rather than \"showing\", I dug \"Kai's\" storyline, action scenes and basic themes. This latest incarnation of \"Dragon Ball\" is better than what I saw on Cartoon Network. I'm hooked, and I'll watch it when I have a chance.",
        "I can understand some people not liking very much the pacing the original Dragon Ball Z due the excessive amount of filler episodes (I think some of those filler episodes were good, like the one where Goku and Piccolo get their drivers license) but I must confess the pacing of Dragon Ball Z Kai is a bit rushed at moments, diminishing the tension and dramatic impact of several parts of the story.In addition to that, there is a certain level of censorship that tones down the violence of some scenes, in order to make the series more (modern) kid-friendly.To get things worse, in my country the dub changed several of the voices, and the new choices were not as good as the original Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z counterparts: Fortunately, most of the original cast finally returns for the Majin Bu saga, which also has a better pacing, being way less rushed than all the previous sagas (which at moments feel like recaps)For those who.can't stand fillers, this series probably is \"better\" than the \"dated\" original, but I think something is missing here, which is part of the charm of the classic Dragon Ball Z.",
        "DBZ Kai was something I had to watch and after hearing it was an edited version of the original DBZ I was like \"Ok, let me see what it is\" And I have to say I am glad for it. I can see all the major arcs in condensed form (159 episodes without all the filler episodes that brought the original Z to 291 episodes. While I enjoyed watching Z, the filler episodes and long drawn out fights really made me think of some of those as background noiseIt basically has all the good parts, and I enjoy watching it because it's like getting the best of the show. Some of the colors have been softened and I do believe the voice cast has changed partway but I haven't noticed a huge difference so far (80 episodes in) I hope you truly enjoy this version of DBZ as it is the best and most concise version of the series",
        "Dragon Ball Z Kai took what was already an overly-long, awkwardly- paced, zero-stakes anime that, admittedly, was a highly influential show and redid it better. The show was more sleek and at least watchable, but it still has major flaws.In short, I don't think Dragon Ball Z was great, but it was definitely important. It exposed a new generation of adults and children to a medium that was pretty fringe in the United States up until that point. However, no amount of cultural importance could really change the quality of that show. The show was plagued by unbearably long charging scenes, transformation scenes, reaction shots, and filler, not to mention stilted dialogue, bad dubbing, and unfunny jokes that are just really dated. Characters that were pretty paper-thin, a contrived plot that was sometimes compelling but moved along at a snail's pace, and the only saving grace (the action) was mostly interrupted by all these other terrible things that I mentioned.Dragon Ball Z Kai took an already flawed anime and made it a lot more enjoyable. Pull out all the filler, update the animation, and get some new voice-actors (most of which were superior, a few being inferior). It took out a lot of the choppiness and the show ended up an above- average show that's not a classic. But, you couldn't help but feel when watching it that they were just milking the cash cow to try to squeeze more money out of it, just like another show I can think of . . . it's on the tip of my tongue . . . GP? CT? No, that's not it, never mind. In conclusion, the show's fine, better than the original, but definitely not one of the 250 best television shows of all time.",
        "Years ago before dragon ball z Kai I watched a bit of Some Poorly dubbed Dragon ball and Dragon Ball GT and the laughable ocean dub version of DBZ (with Some of the worst Acting known to man)I think dragon ball z Kai is the best of the series Much better than the 1999 Funimation dub because It is much more faithful to the manga.Unlike the original Dragon Ball Z, there is very little filler. As a result, the pacing is much quicker and comparable to that of the original Dragon Ball anime.The English dub by Funimation is really good. It's also more consistent with the manga and is somewhat more mature than the English dub of Dragon Ball Z.Gohan's new Voice is cute but childish (a lot of funimation dub fans hate Gohan's new Voice but i like it)Even Freiza's new Voice was epic and much better than his Funimation dub VoiceIt has Great intros and outros, Memorable music, with theme songs for some characters like \"Saiyan Blood\", Vegeta's theme.It has No filler arcs.and the animation was superior to dragon ball zBut The remastered Majin Buu Saga episodes were done on a lower budget than the Saiyan Saga/Frieza Saga/Cell Saga episodes, and it shows.this series is not as bad as what the Funimation 1999 Fans sayIf you miss dragon ball z than dragon ball z Kai is all you need Because it was the best version of DBZ",
        "I am what you may call a Dragon Ball person.I started to watch the original series back in the late 80's when they were being aired in France before most other countries besides Japan itself.I was done with the all thing when it wasn't even being aired in the US.I watched it again and again and again along the years as well as all the movies and specials that exist.In fact, Dragonball was part of my youth and the benchmark for all animations afterwards.So, when i learned about Kai and the fact that they were cutting stuff off and leaving a lot of the fillers in th trash can i had a \"purist\" reaction and refused to watch it as i considered that the original work should be preserved intact in my mind.Nevertheless, with the appearance of the new movie Revival of F, i decided to give it a try as it was the only Dragonball material i had never seen.Well, i must say that this is a lot better than the original.Even if some fillers were fun and interesting, i agree that the pace of the Manga was much more proper for a Shounen anime of this kind. This Kai version shows this perfectly.This new version is action packed like it should have been and settles many stuff like plot holes and other inconsistencies created by the original Z series by the fillers.These fillers were being made up out of the manga because at the time, Akira Toriyama was actually late in the manga comparing to the anime. This show was so popular that the animation was ahead of the ink and they had to invent stuff and exaggerate the time of power ups and stare contests between fighters.The Kai version is so much better, I recommend everyone to see it and forget about the original because, well, a good 1/4 of it is made up material without story validity.Dragonball seems to be more alive than never with Kai reaching the end of the series and new movies of legit material being produced by Toriyama.It's staggering to see myself, 25 years after the first Dragonball episodes i saw as a kid, still trembling of joy at the sight of new Dragonball material.To me, this is undeniably the greatest anime franchise that ever existed.",
        "Biggest turn offs for me are the change in the voice actors and the different dialogue that characters say. Both those combined make the kai version of Frieza very disappointing and unintimidating.",
        "I honestly despised DBZ Kai when I first tried to watch it on TV. The music and voice changes were unbearable; however, after spending the last few days watching the initial episodes, I realized that this remake is actually phenomenal. Once you get used to the changes in the music and voices, DBZ Kai is quite entertaining.I am actually glad that the fillers are gone. I remember watching DBZ reruns and couldn't help but get bored when Goku was travelling to King Kai's planet. DBZ Kai has done a good job with sticking to the most important pieces of the plot. I am still in the Frieza saga of DBZ Kai, but I am very impressed with the overall content.I have seen the Funimation, Ocean, and now the Kai dub of DBZ, and I must say that I find the overall script of Kai to be superior to the other two dubs. I find the content to be more insightful in the Kai dub. One of my main deterrents from watching this show was the fact that they stopped it at the Cell saga. I am more ecstatic than ever now since I just read that the Majin Buu saga, which in my opinion is the best saga, is being released sometime in August. As a result, I feel that DBZ Kai is worth the watch.",
        "The boring story is always the same that goku's friends are in crisis and goku help them and defeat the villian literally we know the villian is going to be defeated so many expected things and the hero is the strongest and nobody is strongest than him what kind of story is that.",
        "DBZ is considered one of the best shows created by man, and it is no lie. They decided to remaster it with different voices and no fillers, and i am NOT disappointed. First off, let's talk about the voices. Every single one was improved. Even Gohan, even though he sounds like a little girl, its a lot more fitting for a toddler than a tween voice...And Frieza's voice doesn't sound like a chick anymore, he sounds like a creepy chilling villain now. But, this show hasn't been getting good responses by original DBZ fans. They say that they completely ruined the show by cutting some scenes and changing voices around. THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THOSE PEOPLE: GET OVER IT. YOU CANT STOP IT SO JUST GET OVER IT AND WATCH YOUR ORIGINAL DBZ INSTEAD OF BEING CRYBABIES ABOUT IT. So overall, this show is worthy to join the DBZ family in my book.",
        "I like this show but it's not as good as dbz this show is literally Dragon Ball Z But no Filler let's be honest dbz filler is actually good Heres My list of Pros and Cons\nPros\nGreat Script\nFights are still as good as dbz fights\nFrieza Voice\nAmazing Soundtrack Saiyan-Frieza Saga\nCons\nTERRIBLE VOICE ACTING (Besides Frieza)\nAlot of the good filler is gone. NOW IN MY OPINION YOU SHOULD WATCH DBZ BUT I DONT HATE KAI BECAUSE KAI WAS MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO DBZ THOUGH ONCE I WATCHED DBZ I LIKED IT MORE",
        "I'm just reviewing the first 4 seasons, not the final chapters.First things first. The voice acting is a 10/10 and I think all the replacements did a fantastic job. You can see how the old voice actors really improved. Their vocal inflections, timing, emotion, etc is a 100x more pronounced and believable. I really enjoyed Frieza's new voice. Chris Ayres's rendition of Frieza was genius. Gohan's new voice actor also does a wonderful job.Filler is more or less absent or at least not noticeable. The pacing is also vastly improved. I didn't find myself clock watching or fast forwarding throughout my viewing of any of these first few seasons. Is there some \"duh\" moments? Yes. After all this is meant for a teen audience. Anyways, I found every minute to be entertaining even though I've already seen the original, I always loved and found the occasional jokes, funny reactions, and roasts refreshing.The only things I didn't enjoy was toei's replacements for some of the cells, no pun intended, but some of the replaced frames look really really bad.. . Other than that, it looks better than the dragon boxes (just my opinion), it sounds better than ever before, and the writing is much more mature and faithful to the manga.Music: I'm not a big fan of Kichuci's original score, so I found a way to replace the music with faulconer. There's a kazenshuu post with audio files that allow you to replace the music with faulconer's. This literally is perfect, the whole series is now nearly flawless.P.S. Chiaotzu and Puar are still unbearable but thankfully only on screen for like 5 minutes total. I'd rather have ten filler episodes revolved around Yamcha than watch 1 minute of chiaotzu and puar.",
        "dragon ball Kai is the same as dragon ball z, but its uncut and remastered and HD all together there's only 100 episodes in total when dragon ball z had around 200 episodes the story is all the same but all the fillers are all cut out so there will hardly be any wasted talking and mostly fighting I'm a really big fan of dragon ball I've seen all the episodes and the movies. So I'm a big fan i recommend this to everyone if you want to start watching dragon ball z start on dragon ball Kai Dragonball Kai is the best anime ever made and always will be you should also watch dragon ball and dragon ball gt there are all 10 out of 10",
        "I've been a lover of Dragon Ball Z for most of my life. Z was my obsession through childhood and I remained an avid fan even as an adult. I've been there through the quirky Ocean Dub, the poorly-translated VHS fansubs, the garish orange bricks... Dragon Ball Kai isn't just the best version of Dragon Ball Z, it's the only version of Dragon Ball Z anyone should ever watch, for anything other than purely nostalgic reasons. DBZ was bogged down by a nearly unwatchable amount of filler. And I'm not even talking about filler story lines like Garlic Jr. or Goku fighting a star. What dragged Z down was the constant stalling: scenes of people powering up for two episodes straight, replaying the same scene of people staring at each other three times. Entire episodes pass with absolutely no progress on the primary storyline.But Dragon Ball Kai fixes all of this. The great fighting and exciting story of Dragon Ball Z is finally, for the first time ever as an anime, brought to its due glory. This is the Dragon Ball Z that should have existed from the very start, the definitive, superior version. Thankfully, the terrible new music turned out to be plagiarized, and Z's original soundtrack was restored. So truly the only thing that's better about Dragon Ball Z over Kai, are the opening and ending themes. Kai's new themes are cheesy and clich\u00e9', while Cha La and Zenkai Power were pretty cool. Admittedly, it's not 100% without flaws. The Saiyan Saga cuts out a smidge too much, and feels ever so slightly rushed, while the Cell Saga kept a smidge too much filler, and it's noticeable. But the Freeza Saga is perfect down to the very frame. To say that Dragon Ball Kai is better than Dragon Ball Z doesn't even do it justice. It's the only version of Dragon Ball Z that should exist. It makes me embarrassed to have held the original Z in such high regard. I used to take a blind eye to Z's innumerable flaws because I had such a history with it. But now that Kai has come out, and it is such a genuinely spectacular show, I'm proud to be a fan again.",
        "The original DBZ had too much filler it was good on tv as there was time gap in watching episodes. It was very streched. I you want to binge watch then watch this.",
        "I've enjoyed Dragon Ball Z for over a decade, along with everything else Dragon Ball and this is no exception. Dragon Ball Z Kai is enjoyable, and even though I enjoy (and dislike) some of the filler in DBZ, Kai is in no way to be classed as terrible for taking most of it out - some minor bits have been left in.The dialogue has improved, I like Frieza's new voice actor and the original voice actors have improved slightly. Gohan's new voice actress I was fine with it at first, but it did start to annoy at times, now after a while, I have sort of got used to it again.When it comes to the music, I prefer the Japanese version of: \"Dragon Soul\", \"Yeah! Break! Care! Break!\" and \"Wings of the Heart\" I really enjoy \"Saiyan Blood\" and \"Only A Chilling Elegy.\" I enjoy all of the music in Kai even if Kenji Yamamoto \"borrowed\" it, I also enjoy Shunsuke Kikuchi and Bruce Faulconer's music so I don't really have an argument over music.DBZ is there when I want to hide away for days - DBZK is there when I want to watch it quicker. Then I also have the option of Dragon Ball and Team Four Star ;3 It's Dragon Ball, I like it all, even GT.It's not just for young children. The DVD's are uncut (there is blood, a little less blood than Z but added \"swearing\"), the television version is censored for a reason.The Buu Saga, is on the way! I hope they keep the worms in, I guess they won't though :(One thing I am annoyed about is that the UK will have to wait or may never get the Dragon Boxes of any of the series' or the movies. Unless bought from overseas at high cost.",
        "Was a great one with all the extension removed and story only on mark. However the series started to get boring in Cell Saga. But overall you should prefer Kai.",
        "The Dragon Ball series has always been my favourite anime and Kai is no exception, if you liked Z but didn't like most of the fillers then you're going to love Kai. It has little to no fillers HD quality and probably improved on the voices, I also like the new \"Dragon Soul\" song at the start too! I do have some problems with Kai though one being that everyone in this show just loves to kinda break the fourth-wall, the show is literally riddled with exposition and it kinda of gets annoying this is the same in Z too, but I kinda didn't care at the same time because the show is so good, and lastly Gohan's character development is kind of choppy in Kai not so much in Z though, Z's version of Gohan's development was much better due to the fillers, but I get why they didn't because they wanted to avoid the fillers for Kai. Kai is also much shorter than Z too, the Frieza saga in Z ends at Episode 107, while Kai ends at episode 52 due to the lack of filler, but I think it is a good thing considering the fight between Goku and Frieza last for 3 hours in Z. Overall I love this show if you're someone who has never seen Z and want to see a version most accurate to the manga then watch Kai you'll love it.",
        "I read the manga 13 years ago. This Dragon Ball kai is the what in TV was called Dragon Ball Z, from when Goku appears with his son Gohan. I've always disliked DBZ for the very frequent and boring fillers it contains (DBZ is more than 200 eps in total) and I wondered how a \"serious\" adaptation from the manga would be since I've enjoyed the manga very much. Now this surprise, I'm much older but it is fun to see Goku&Co adventures again. I've seen about 30 episodes so far and I think a good cut and paste of the original DBZ is being done, even if there are occasions when some little fillers are still present and maybe others when they cut too much (not real fillers) but it was probably necessary.So this is a very rare possibility to see a popular long anime without boring and useless fillers and anyway it is a still very good fast paced action-fighting anime with energy blast and flying characters even if it has obviously outdated animation (about 15-20 years).",
        "Becoming a fan rather late into the game (After the original Toonami was dead and Gone), I thought I'd never have a chance to get to watch it. I started watching Z online, but the slow pace and constant filler breaks caused me to initially lose interest. Kai was the perfect remedy for that. After removing the filler, the end of the Cell arc of Kai was placed at 98 episodes. Literally HALF of the original's near 200. There still is filler (Gregory, the Frog Ginyu, and Mr. Satan's (Hercule in the Televised version) pupils) but far more condensed and only left in when the characters introduced could not be removed from the Animation. This made Dragon Ball Z Kai the extraordinary lightning-paced battle anime that you'd expect Z to have been. The majority of the English cast returned, with few exceptions where more fitting actors were found, or, in the case of Frieza, the old actors couldn't meet the Demand. The few changed actors are Incredible. Kai kept Frieza as the Chilling, Sadistic Villain he was in the Japanese version, and Chris Ayers provides the voice Talents to match.From what little I'd seen of Z, i knew the TV version was Censored, cutting out blood and, from the start of the Frieza arc, direct references to Death. But that was also solved with Funimation's release of Uncut DVDs. I was presently surprised to find that, along with mostly uncut footage (Some edits were made in Japan to fit new laws in place since it's original 1989 run), there was an uncut Dialogue track as well, reinstating all references to Death as well as introducing mild swears (Let this double as a warning to parents. If your seven-year-old son wants a copy of this Anime on DVD, you need to know this). This dispelled all rumors I'd hear that Kai was a just little kids show.All this was backed by an astounding new soundtrack, which I was saddened to hear was removed due to copyright infringement. (If you want as much of Kai with the removed score as possible, find the \"Part\" sets. the first four contain the Original Kai score)And those of you disappointed this version does not extend to the final arc, you will be pleased to know that it has been confirmed that it is in production, and is speculated to be released later this yearAll in all, I have to say that Kai is the best version of Dragon Ball Z yet. Aiming for new fans with a child-safe television dub, and catering to the old fans with its uncut DVD version. I was very pleased with it, and I think that if Old fans could take off their nostalgia goggles, they'd definitely agree.",
        "I REALLY don't understand why people praise Kai, I watched half of the Saiyan Saga IF THAT and I just wanted to stab myself in the face and rip my ears off...the transition from old anime to new is just dreadful they should have just redrawn the entire thing and added the original voices, stay away from Kai and watch the remastered and uncut version which is superior to this abomination.They did nothing but trash the name of Dragon Ball Z, GT was almost as bad as this THING. Thankfully we got a new series that follows on where Z more or less left off.Again if anyone is new to the series stay away from this pile of rubbish they decided to more or less in my opinion half arse and then slap a new sticker on it.",
        "Dragon Ball Z Kai is an excellent recut of the original Z for everyone who enjoys them some Dragon Ball, especially Z. If you also prefer the manga, or just hate the majority of DBZ's slow-paced extra segments, or worthless filler episodes, This is the version to watch. It has every piece of canon material from the manga, with some short filler either due to animation from the original Z being unable to be changed, or the staff leaving some in for whatever reason that could've been removed, but didn't. It leads to a faster-paced storyline that's been streamlined a bit for many fans of Z. Though there ARE a few redrawn scenes to replace damaged frames. Some are simply trace jobs, while the others are completely new. They fit decently though.This is also the version of Z to get for excellent home releases. If you didn't know, Z has some of the most horrendous home releases I've ever seen. Terrible color correction, terrible remastering all around, really, plus cropping the show to 16:9, leaving us who want to enjoy the show as it was produced out of luck unless we track down the Dragon Boxes, which are LONG out of print & expensive on sites like eBay. This series was properly remastered frame-by-frame in Japan for High Definition airings & releases in its original 4:3 aspect ratio, minus The Final Chapters, which was done by a different team several years after the first part finished airing. Still, it's much better than FUNimation's remasters, I'll tell ya that. If you wanna get someone into the franchise, this is definitely the way. Personally, I DO wish that they reanimated everything from the ground up, but I understand why they did it as they did.Then there's the English dub. Minus some recastings (Kid Gohan, Kid Goku, Bulma, Frieza, & a lot of secondary & tertiary characters voiced by Chris Sabat in Z) because of actor/actress availability in the intervening years prior to 2009, all of the main voice actors returned to reprise their roles & they sound GREAT! Sean Schemmel especially, since he now gets Goku's character completely. Yeah, they didn't simply reuse audio from Z, they rerecorded everything from the ground up. The added benefit of this, other than improved acting, is that since FUNimation's a better dubbing company since 2003 when the Z dub finished airing, they have the resources to not only get better translations prior to dubbing but they also have access to better writers for their dub scripts! This means no mistranslations, other than the oddly-put line of dialogue, & some dubisms returning either out of keeping with pre-established terms from previous dubs, or some inconsistencies with attack names that were changed in earlier dubs from the original Japanese. Safe to say, if you're an English dub fan, the dubbing is phenomenal! There IS one thing I have to bring up though. In The Final Chapters, the series' recut of the Buu Saga, there's a scene recapping the events of the Cell Games from the previous arc. Prior to broadcast, it was teased that Team Four Star, of Dragon Ball Z Abridged fame, would be voicing the actors in the reenactment of the events. When it finally aired & was released to home video, it was discovered that they were replaced with the original Z audio from the same scene last-minute. It's speculated it's because the people at Toei found out & forced the change in dialogue. The original audio for the scene was accidentally released on X-Finiti & subsequently released to the internet after a fan recorded it. It's a shame because I love DBZA & it's a shame that the audio couldn't be kept, but that's the business, I guess. On the Japanese side of things, the original Japanese cast, though there were some recastings due to actors either dying or not wanting to come back, rerecorded their dialogue as well, mostly because Toei junked the original audio masters some time after the show aired for some reason before they could really use them on future releases. If you want a clearer-sounding DBZ in Japanese, this is good for that as well. I should also mention that the music has undergone a bit of controversy. Originally, for the first run of the show, Kenji Yamamoto, who also did the score for the Budokai games, composed the score for the series. However, it was eventually found out that he intentionally ripped off the scores for Avatar & Terminator Salvation without Toei's knowledge. His score was subsequently replaced on both sides of the Pacific with the original Shunsuke Kikuchi score from Z for the first part. The Final Chapters uses a new score composed by Norihito Sumitomo, who also composed the scores for Battle of Gods, Resurrection F, & went on to do the score for Dragon Ball Super. Some of his compositions don't fit, but most of the rest reminds me of Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury's score with how they were synthesized. Kind of fitting, I think. As for the openings & closings, most of them are great. 'Dragon Soul's' a great theme song, especially when sung in the English dub by the legendary Vic Mignognia. Final Chapters is no slouch either. 'Fight It Out' is also pretty good & goes with the whole retro vibe you get from the show, considering it originally ran from 1989-1995 & the original animation reflects that. Though the Japanese Final Chapters theme that was a part of the Japanese broadcast, 'Kuu-Zen-Zetsu-Go' was no slouch in being awesome either.Altogether, I enjoy Kai. It's, definitely, my version of Z, especially since I don't care for the Z dub too much. I recommend it to everyone who likes good TV."

    "Future Boy Conan": [
        "Though Hayao Miyazaki's work at Studio Ghibli is known the world over, few outside of Japan seem to know or care about the work he did before that in the 70s and early 80s. It's a real shame, because works such as Future Boy Conan (1978) still hold up well today despite the choppy television animation.The plot is chock full of iconic Miyazaki themes and archetypes which look forward to his later films and manga. The post-apocalyptic setting, motif of flight, morally ambiguous characters, and environmentalist theme should all be familiar to hardcore Miyazaki fans. In fact, the whole thing feels like a dress rehearsal for the later Castle in the Sky (1986): the relationship between Lana and Conan mirrors the later bond between Pazu and Sheeta, the villain Lepka resembles Muska, and Captain Dyce and his crew bring to mind the Dola pirates.Despite the similarities, though, Future Boy Conan stands well on its own. I would even go as far as to say it equals (or in some cases, even betters) Castle in the Sky. Being a 26-episode TV series, it has more time to let its characters develop and grow. One major difference between FBC and later Miyazaki is it's broad comedy. There's lots of goofy slapstick and silly moments that you don't see the like of in post-Nausicaa Miyazaki. Still, it's good comedy that never feels out of place.I know most anime fans won't watch anything preceding Dragonball, but Ghibli fans and Miyazaki diehards will enjoy this series without a doubt. It helps show you where all those ideas, characters, and themes of his later films were first allowed to be fully expressed.",
        "This was Miyazaki's first TV series he directed. It aired in Japan back in 1978 a year before his first film \"Castle of Cagliostro\".It's about an alternate future when WW3 ended in 2008. After that most of the earth's continents are underwater. And forming small separate islands.On one Island there's a young Boy who's no ordinary kid. Has super strengh and can hold his breathe for a long time. Lives alone with his Granfather on a lonely island where several people use to live on.One day how ever when a girl appears on the shore of the island that's when Conan goes on his adventure to see the rest of the existing world he didn't know existed.\"Future Boy Conan\" is a unique anime series. It showed how great Hayao Miyazaki was way before he got into movie making. A total of 26 episodes each one continues from the other. It's like watching a really long movie.Has everything you'd expect from a Miyazaki made Anime. A Boy and Girl with mysterious powers or past, Anything that can fly, pigs, women with good role play, and hope for a brighter future.This was known to be Miyazaki's earlier version of \"Castle in the Sky\" the 2 Main Characters look a lot like Pazu and Sheeta, and the main villain looks almost like Musca too. This anime had a lot of reused ideas he used for his later anime films too.Sadly this anime has never been debuted into English before. Even if it did 20 years ago TV Cencorship of America would edit out the violence and certain drug use.When will it be available in English, only time will tell. It's highly recommended to those who admire Miyazaki and anime. Conan deserves to be on the top 10 classic Animes of all time.Those who want to see it, try Fansubs or internet search to see the series. It's worth watching.I give it a 9/10 for a cool anime.",
        "A fabulous series, Miyazaki's debut as a director, which was broadcast on Japanese tv in 1978, later dubbed into English, and has now been remastered on blu ray for GKIDS. After a world war in 2008(!) involving \"geomagnetic weapons,\" the earth's environment has collapsed, swallowed up by the oceans, with only a few surviving islands and scattered communities of humans (interestingly, the series was before global warming concerns were widespread--the vibe is mostly biblical). My kiddos and I watched this over the month of June, about one 22-minute episode an evening. They were endlessly fascinated by the misrepresented future-past, and by the energetic, hopeful Japanese songs accompanying the intro and closing sequences. But most of all they loved the distinctive animation and gripping plot, which is closest to Nausicaa, but also anticipates most of the early Ghibli films. This was especially true of the central figures, Conan and Lana, who are a near replica of Potsu and Sheeta of Castle in the Sky, and Monsley, who is basically a mean-spirited Nausicaa. In some ways, the show is very dark: as my daughter pointed out, when the evil leader of Industria, Lepka, restarts the \"poison moth\" plane (apparently a geomagnetic weapon), he seems to have no other goal than to destroy the remaining peoples and rule from above until it runs out of power and crashes: a kind of species-wide death drive. But overall it projects a relentless optimism, above all in the laughter and tenacity of Conan and Lana, who ultimately succeed in re-founding humanity.",
        "Highly dramatic and engaging, this TV series was near perfect and shows Miyazaki's talents for the first time he directed something. Interestingly, Miyazaki's characters that he developed in this TV series served as prototypes for the films he made. Indeed, this TV series is actually one 26 episode long film with many subplots that constitute each of the episodes.Also, it is impressively dramatic considering it was a TV series marketed for children. The Japanese animated TV series were always much more dramatic and complex than American animated TV series, but in the 1970's anime it was still in its early stages and wasn't as well developed as it became in the 1980's, when it's range expanded to all demographic groups.An excellent TV series, indeed, one of the most powerful ever made. Yes, I said powerful for an animated TV series from the 1970's, because it is.",
        "Future Boy Conan. I agree - the show was amazing in many ways - storytelling in particular, comedy and of course the attention to details. I watched it as a kid but it was so entrenched in our culture that I looked it up as an adult so I can re-watch. This is now the 3rd time I'm re-watching in the past 10 years.However I had to write this review after reading the others who are praising Miyazaki for his creation but never mention that it is actually based on the novel: The Incredible Tide. I did not read the novel so I cannot say to what extent does it resemble the series and while I do not doubt that Miyazaki is great, come on; give credit where its due. Alexander Key wrote the original story and even the character names are very similar, who knows what else did Miyazaki borrow.",
        "Even rewatching this now, the story is epic, many great twists, keeps you edge of seat, not a dull moment, great characters ad the funny parts are hilarious. This is a masterpiece well ahead of it's time. If you have never watched it then put in on your bucket list. For years before I was searching for this on VCD. The whole artwork is great especially for that time. A must see. If you watched this in 1978 and now is still so good then you know it's a 10/10. A timeless masterpiece. Thank you to Nippon Animation and team and voice artists for this diamond gem. Only now after more than 40yrs I realized rhe voice of conan was done by a female actor. I should have known as alot anime boys voices are done by females and not males but it was a nice interesting surprise which made me appreciate the skill of the voice actors. Mieko Nobusawa voice for Lana is also absolutely excellent. A must see (now) cult following anime tv series.",
        "For everyone that likes animation, one name usually stands out: Hayao Miyazaki. Most know him from his incomparable film career, but he earned his dues on television first. He worked on the HEIDI cartoon, a number of others, and this FUTURE BOY CONAN.It maybe telling that the two shows I most remember growing up are exactly HEIDI and CONAN. I've loved Miyazaki's work even before I could understand they came from him.Conan is an absolute adventure, with loads of sentiment and joy. It's Miyazaki stretching his storytelling muscles.",
        "THE BEST animated series of all time. CONAN!!!!!!!!!!",
        "I have seen all 11 of Miyazaki's films multiple times, being a huge fan of his and Studio Ghibli's work, but in my opinion, out of all the works he has done, Future Boy Conan is his masterpiece. I absolutely adore this show! I loved the story, I loved the characters, I loved the chemistry between Conan and Lana, I loved how gripping the whole thing was and it ended on a great note!Future Boy Conan could be the most underrated and overlooked TV show of all time. I've seen this show twice and honestly, I'm tempted to call it my favourite TV show of all time (NO JOKE!). It is that good. So many people are missing out. If you are a Miyazaki fan, I strongly recommend you check out 26 episodes of brilliant story-telling. All the episodes are available in 1080p quality on KissAnime, subbed only. What are you waiting for? Watch it right now. You will not be disappointed!If only most kids TV shows nowadays were even close to the quality of Future Boy Conan.10/10 from me!",
        "This is one of the first Miyazaki's. He made it in 1978. Was originally released in Italian then dubbed to Japanese. Future boy Conan is a story about a boy and his grand father who were the only survivors of the third world war. Apparently, there were more survivors who did not learn the lesson of preserving life. The anime is not about super beings or the supernatural. It is about ordinary people with ordinary powers driven by pure feelings of goodwill and platonic love. Miyazaki engraved his name in history and in the heart of generations to come with this anime. He gave life to those characters who live in our heart as people we know and learn from. The story line is superb. The characters are lovely. The drawing is magnificent for a 1978 anime. What else are you waiting for....don't miss this anime.",
        "I would say its the best \"animated anything\" of all time, but to avoid excessive hyperbole I reluctantly confine myself to \"Japanese anime TV series\". This is one of Hayao Miyazaki's earlier projects (by no means earliest), and yet it is his best. The colors are not as rich, the animation not as fluid as in his later works but its still his best. Its a 1970's anime made with 1970s techniques, yet you could not want it any other way. The character's drawing is simple by later standards, monotone faces, quite flat, but they are unforgettable and their visual \"flatness\" only emphasizes their depth of character. The scenery despite the limitations of technology is simply beautiful. All in all, what Miyazaki achieved with this series is the equivalent of replicating the Mona Lisa using nothing but crayons. I will say no more. Except that I pity that part of the world which never had the pleasure to watch it or even hear of it.",
        "There's only one thing to say about this series - get it now! Of course you've probably seen it if you're even reading this but if not then sort it out.I'm not going to write a review, there are plenty available, this is the internet. I've said all that's important already. Only thing is there aren't enough stars to rate Miyazaki's work on IMDb.Incidentally you may want to read the English short sci fi novel called \"The Incredible Tide\" by Alexander Key upon which this series is based.This animation series appears to be a prototype for Miyazaki's film Laputa: Castle in the Sky - at least its chief characters Pazu and Shita are based on Conan and Lana of this series.Also check out Sherlock Hound, all of Masterpiece Theatre series and the amazing 1968 collaboration featurelength animation 'Horus Prince of the Sun' by Miyazaki and Takahata.",
        "Although it is old, it is a beautiful and wonderful anime",
        "If you like early Miyazaki animated films like Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Nausicaa, and Lupin: Castle of Cagliostro you will enjoy watching this TV series. On the surface it seems like a simple children's adventure story but because Miyazaki is such a fantastic visual storyteller, he greatly elevates the material into a fun animated adventure.The characters are strong willed, independent, charming and cute. However, some of the characters are just archetypes that don't have much depth but it's not a character study show. The drama comes from the unexpected conflict between the characters and the well structured plot that evolves over 26 episodes and takes a group of characters on an adventure. The dialogue at times can be simple but you have to remember that this show was made for kids. Even at it's worst the dialogue is still funny to listen to. I would definitely watch this with friends and fans of Miyazaki movies.Here are some aspects of the show that made it interesting for me to watch as an animation nerd. Conan is pure miyazaki and an expressive representation of what all young boys aspire to be. Lana is strikingly similar to the Lucita character in the film Castle in the Sky. Captain Dyce is a prototype of a dumb but silly pirate leader seen in Porco Rosso. Mosley is a prototype character of Kushana from Nausicaa and has a redemptive character arc similar to Zuko in Avatar the Last Airbender. Jimsey is the comic relief character who mostly thinks only of food. The bad guy character is your typical James Bond villain who wants power.There are hundreds of shots in this tv show that Miyazaki would later recreate in his later films. It happens so often that you could make a fun drinking game out of it. My sister and I enjoyed looking out for these shots and the visual similarities added another layer of enjoyment to watching this. Here are the films that I noticed shots that the layouts / staging of the characters and environment were later recreated in subsequent Miyazaki films: Castle of Cagliostro, Nausica, Castle in the Sky, Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, The Wind Rises.I watched the Japanese Dub Version but will watch the English Dub on next viewing.",
        "Conan is a cult case in Portugal, at least for people who are now around their thirties. Having been broadcast in 1984, it garnered a lot of following and deservedly so (it has been put on sale on DVD the past year - 2004). The story, has most of the themes that populates Miyazaki's work: man as the entity that destroys nature, the conflict between nature and technology, elements that would be developed in features like \"Castle in the Sky\" or \"Princess Mononoke\". I've been a fan of Mr. Miyazaki's work for some time now, and that started with Conan (and I personally remember having the cards that were placed on sale at the time it was first shown) - this show was magical, funny and the main character represented a freedom that every kid longs or aims for. The animation nowadays is dominated by computers, but somehow this work is a true classic: you still look at it with awe and amazement, for all the uniqueness that made it so special when it first was shown is still all there. A must see!",
        "How I wish I was a child seeing Conan, if not to enjoy without knowledge of Hayao Miyazaki, but to have been able to go to school and talk about it with all my friends. It would have been my favourite show. Instead I've made do watching older, it's excellent though.To explain the plot, the world has been partially destroyed by man through use of nuclear weapons, tilting the world on its axis, thus sinking most of the land and destroying civilisation as we know it. 30 years later the few survivors are on living on a small island, Conan an 11 year old boy lives with his grandfather peacefully, until a girl washes up on the beach. It would be criminal to go much further since one of the best features of 'Conan' is its storytelling, and at 26 episodes it can take it's time.Directed by Hayao Miyazaki with some help from Isao Takahata, Conan displays many of the traits of a Ghibli movie, best described and a cross between 'Laputa: Castle in the Sky' and 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind', both in plot and design. It could be said that these films improved and expanded on the ideas in Conan which could be taken that Conan isn't worthwhile, but it's more like Conan is an opportunity to see 13hrs of Miyazaki doing what he does so well.Personally it's very difficult to review Conan, I know I love it, but there's so much to write. The plot is pretty complex, its twists and turns are genuinely surprising. The characters are great, since it's early Miyazaki there's a lot of slapstick, much in the vein of Miyazaki's Lupin III movie, the art direction is certainly of lower quality than his later offerings, but it was his directorial debut. Conan is dated in terms of animation, but again like in Lupin the characters are simplified, thus allowing animation to go smoothly, plus the backgrounds are beautiful, the ideas flowing, the design of the main boat is cleverly an upside down boat adapted to sail, at least I think it is! Its a few years before Joe Hisaishi is working with Miyazaki, so the music is less grand, but sweet and catchy.Conan is a fantastic, while dated is as good a show a child or adult could watch today, plus another excellent Miyazaki project for the converted. I really can't praise Conan enough!",
        "Do watch it. It is very rare to find these days anyways",
        "hello dear web site managers and miyazaki funs. I am one of the fun of miyazaki s products.especially adventure of Conan is my favorite. I need friendship help for find adventure of Conan s DVD or etc. this miyazaki s product is so important for me to show it to my children and to my friend.because I live in turkey and we have not got that product here so if there is any chance to find that movie and if any person want s to help me to find that movie I will be grateful. Please contact me from email address below.Best regards Ozcan Bavlibavliozcan@yahoo.com",
        "i saw that series may be 10 times, it was my favorite and still is, to my knowledge they still run the series in Baghdad TV.the story, the drawing, the coloring, the robots, the castle, and the flying wing, all these were smashing great.i wish they turn it to a movie, it was one hell of work, and every kid and adult favorite in Iraq back in the 1980. the show was a welcome change to Iraqi channel and a new introduction to sci fie to Iraqis , people started to like sci fie as a choice to see . the show talked about dictatorship and people control ( something every Iraq back in 80's know it), so the show hit more than one spot.",
        "It is one of the few animation series that I remember being broadcasted here in Portugal when I was younger (1984). I didn't know who the author was, but I loved it. Best of all, in those days here in Portugal, they would show Japanese Animation with the original voices (Japanese) with Portuguese subtitles.Now about the series: It has drama, it has action, and it has comedy, all packed in fantastic animation (for 1978). In one series we see all the themes Hayao Miyazaki would use in his films. And a lot of characters are prototypes of others he creates in his films. Fantastic!",
        "First off let me start by saying that the current cover as of 10.31.2015 for this series is wrong. I grew up watching this show. It aired where I lived in mid-late 80's. It became an instant classic. Most people do not realize that this is a Hayao Miyazaki production. For its time this was beautiful and remains so to this day. The story is captivating and the music is phenomenal. I can say that Future Boy Conan is children friendly. It has an older Disney feel to it. Keep in mind this series was first aired in 1978. But it was released in HD for those interested. I recently (no more than 2 months ago) re-watched the entire series. Considering how rare this series is, If you can find this series, buy it. I assure you, you wont regret it.",
        "The story of human stupidity blended with the poetry and artistic power of japan animation. In my opinion the best work of Miyazaki and one of the most instructive story about war and peace. The overall plot is perfect and has the rare quality of being suitable for every audience. The story leverage on the respect of nature, importance of friendship, the damages of war and human madness. There are a lot of characters all with a realistic behavior that can summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the peoples. The authors describe incredibly well some old lifestyles, the beauty of the nature, the simplicity of a normal life without extreme technology.",
        "We as children dreamed of being somewhat like the characters in their independent, strength, and heroism. This series have influenced many people I grew up with watching in both good and bad ways. First seeing Conan or Adnan strengths, diving and swimming abilities encouraged us in becoming athletic, outgoing, adventurist children who got themselves in a lot of fun trouble. But at the same time every person I grew up with started smoking because of one of the episodes where Conan takes a hit (not sure if it was cigarette or a drugs) and thus I remember them smoking at the age of 10/11 . as a parent I'll avoid having my children watching the smoking scene. having this said, the characters developments are amazing, simply all characters are totally good or totally evil , and there were strange behaviors from few characters that didn't fit their development - for example the Captain burning Conan house while they are a sleep knowing they will burn alive ! There were also VERY POWERFUL emotional scenes that were not given the credit or the attention. one of my best cinematic scenes was the time Conan was chained underwater and Lana swam up to take a breath and give it to Conan- that was an extremely powerful, sad and emotional scene that should included music and giving its time and climax- other scenes were familiar the famous titanic scenes that were possibly influenced from this series. and maybe Jacky Chan took from this as well . Other than that I got nothing else to say- I wish there will be a movie that captures the characteristic comedy of the same characters - Oh well -",
        "Seeing Conan as a child thanks to my father, I can confidently say this movie opened the way to the various other works of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli movies.Now, many years later (I am 22), after watching many other animated series, I can assurely argue that this is one of the best animes ever created.In a style similar to Akira, Future Boy Conan set a standart and an example for animes such as Cowboy Bebop, Rurouni Kenshin and many others who would later be considered the breakthrough animes of their generation.The series consists of only 26 episodes, being short without disregarding character development, displaying amazing creativity and attention to detail and leaving the viewers with the satisfied sensation that they have lived the whole adventure, which is now complete. Not having a dull moment, a filler episode or any sort of fan service (a bit like Hunter x Hunter, Full metal Alchemist, Mob Psycho 100 or Death Note).Truly a masterpiece, funny but with depth, beautiful story telling and beautiful animation.A Miyazaki's work ahead of it's time which sadly remains unknown for the majority of the younger generations which many times ignore great animes for being too old."

    "FLCL": [
        "FLCL, aka Fooly Coolly, aka Furi Kuri, is a surreal six part anime from Studio Gainax. It follows twelve year old boy Naota Nandaba whose life changes after a bizarre encounter; one day he is hanging out with his older brother's girlfriend when a girl on a Vespa crashes into him. The girl, Haruko Haruhara initially thinks she has killed him but it turns out he is okay apart from a bump on his head. Strangely the bump grows into a horn like protuberance which later grows into a giant robot and breaks off\u0085 after that things get weirder! I won't describe more of what happens; it has to be seen to be believed.Long before I watched this OVA series I'd heard that it was a bit strange but wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not; now I've seen it I can say it is a good thing! The plot may be strange but if you can accept the happenings it does make sense\u0085 just about. The animation isn't of the highest quality but that suits the story; at times the style changes so that it looks as though we are looking at pages of the manga. I watched most of the series in Japanese with English subtitles and thought it sounded good; I also watched one episode in English and even though I rarely watch dubbed anime I thought the English voice actors did a good job. If you are an anime fan I'd definitely recommend checking out this classic series although I'm not sure I'd recommend it as an introduction to anime as it might be a bit too weird!",
        "Granted had the series gone on I would not have a clue as to how it would have continued with the story. It wrapped up rather nicely, though I have to say it had a really strange ending. Then again the whole series was rather strange and I am sure it was a metaphor for one thing or another not to be taken to literally. My guess something along the lines of a boy going through puberty, or something along those lines. The story has a normal, well not exactly all that normal boy going about his daily life. He has kids that are his age that he sort of hangs out with, but he also hangs out with this older girl that apparently dated his brother who is now playing baseball. Well things are not normal in this town (the giant iron that goes off and is some sort of factory is proof of that), however things are getting even less normal when a gal driving a little scooter soon hits the boy and leaves him with a very nasty head wound and soon moves into his house and life. The boy lives with a rather perverted father and introducing this gal as a new member of the household the cartoon shifts to a manga format. Yes, this show is wacky and crazy as there is also a robot and other objects come out of the boy's head (yes, you read that right). The whole show is very funny and very high energy. One of my main complaints is that sometimes the pacing is too fast and you miss a lot. The characters are great with the crazy alien chick that moves in is very funny as is the dad. The boy at times is a bit whiny, but overall I liked all the characters. To bad the show could not run longer, but on the plus side it is a rather easy show to collect on DVD.",
        "I don't know why some people criticize this anime mini-series for being absurd and random: While it is true that \"FLCL\" is completely absurd and random, those are the main reasons of why this is so entertaining to watch, being a completely unpredictable animation that is also very funny and well done.I liked very much the characters of this series, which were very likable, strange and interesting: The contrast of the \"sanity\" of more \"down to earth\" characters as Naota, with the craziness of characters as Haruko, combined with the many eccentric events that take place in the course of this story results in something very original and fascinating, which never fails to entertain.It also helps the fact that this incredibly well animated and has nice music.Also, the little South Park homage in one of the episodes was simply awesome.\"FLCL\" is something crazy and wonderful at the same time: I'm not sure if this is supposed to be something \"deep\" or \"symbolic\", but personally I enjoyed it very much.",
        "The only reason why I got to watch this anime last night was because I hear the likes of Akidearest, The Anime Man and CDawgVA talking about this on YouTube and I'm like \"Sounds fun, I'll so watch it then !\". When I did watch it, omg I thought I was watching a poorly drawn anime show with such extremely irritating characters. I really can't stand them like seriously, having a immature 20 year old woman always involved in scooter accidents and a brothers desperate lonely girlfriend going after a 12 year old is pretty much distasteful.  Call me what you like but this anime personally sucked for me. I do like the iron building involved but other then that, get this anime away from me....",
        "To start my review off I will start by say I had no idea what this anime was until I recently found Season 2 (Progressive) and Season 3 (Alternative) were announced. So I thought if I want to watch those I need to watch season 1. This is a very good anime all thing considered. I can see how Teen Titans (Original) got its inspiration. At first though I found it weird that a robot was coming out of a noggin but later on I got used it.What I really find beautiful about this anime is the message behind it and the responsibilities of growing up. My only dislike of the story was the love relationship between Haruko and Naota because Haruto is like 21 and Noata is around 10-12, I know its an anime , but a love romantic relationship between a child and an adult absolutely sickness me. However, that was only drawback but they could have explained what exactly is Haruko and her origin. But Kari Wahlgren did a good job voicing her even though the actual character was annoying.Once when my watch list is free I can't wait to check out season 2. However I hope they bring back some characters from season.If you want an anime which is really mature and is robot associated I would recommend FLCL.",
        "Review By Kamal KThe story in this anime makes no sense. Infact, I suggest you don't even try to understand it if you want to enjoy the anime because it will reveal just how dreadful this anime is when you fail to get it.Its truly amazing how this anime was hyped as a glorious masterpiece comedy but when I watched it I didn't even laugh once. This is when I was TRYING to like the anime as well. I came in with expectations and a desire to love this show. I came out totally confused, bored and disgusted by it.But art and animation are undeniably top notch. I have found nothing to complain about in this department.Overall\nOne of the worst anime's I have ever seen.",
        "I like surreal experimental films and animes. I don't mind when it's bizzare or even incohrrent as long as it got a point. Now this anime is bizzare and it does got a point but it is also disgusting and gives so many wrong messages. This must be the kind of anime that makes many people hate anime, over sexualized girls all over being extremely teasing with nonsensical plot and visuals.\nThe sad thing is the creativity behind this anime is huge with amazing animation and so many creative ways (even though silly) to showcase the symbolisms. The story is about the coming of age story of Naota and everything else is his sexual growth it's problems and the woman involved. Now the anime is already pretty nonsensical with the other story arc of the alien girl who uses this boy as portal to bring robots to use them against an alien corporation. But the problem is this non coherent anime got only one thing that makes sense to everyone, it's about how a 12 year old boy is manipulated and used by 3 girls among them 2 older girls and one of them adult, along with a horny father in the house it's always about sex. A sex comedy about a 12 year old boy is not ok. It's ok to show a 12 year olds sexuality and sexual awakening, it's even ok if it is sometimes comical but this show is just atrocious in that aspect. The boy is completely manipulated by girls. At the beginning he's manipulated by the 17 year old girl who was his brother's ex girlfriend and she uses him for her pleasures even if it's not so extreme. Then the alien girl comes and starts manipulating him and he totally falls for it, even at the ending when he could have been better off he's still not out of it. In the middle of the anime the whole sex and death thing with the father is too weird and even after that the boy falls for that girl. \nAll these problems are secondary because it's almost impossible to figure out all this. The biggest problem is while figuring out what's happening one would assume to get something out of it but not something so disgusting, disturbing and appalling. The amount of phallic symbols used in this and the use of cultural references for sexual awakening would be enough to think they aren't symbols anymore. It's almost like pro pedophile.",
        "A series long recommended, with two new seasons announced to premiere in 2023 I thought now the perfect time to finally watch and catch up on this show. Following a young Naota Nandaba, a 12 year old who runs into a vespa riding, guitar-as-a-sword wielding space being Haruhara disguised as a 19 year old girl who hits him upside the head and creates an interdimensional portal in his brain that can bring robots and other random objects across space and time. Pronounced \"Fooly Cooly\", directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki, and written by Yoji Enokido (both of which worked on Neon Genesis Evangelion), FLCL is a deliberately bizarre trip that never makes any sense but does have some cool animations along the way. With references to everything from Transformers to South Park, each season follows a new protagonist interacting with the ever ageless Haruhara as she fights against / works with the N. O., some sort of space police agency, and against the Medical Mechanica which is something I still don't really understand. Series one is by far the best, and I was able to get over its nonsensical-ness because of its cool animations and fairly funny / witty dialogue, but the constant up-skirts / butt-shots / innuendos really got old really fast. Still fairly tame compared to many other anime, I really didn't think it brought much new to the formula unless not making any conceivable sense is something that could be considered new. I managed to finish the series in the mere hope that something would begin to make sense but I can say, no, it never really does. Again, if you're a fan of animation, I'd say that's definitely reason enough to check out the first season, they do some cool stuff, but the rest is very meh, and unfortunately after finishing I'm not near as hyped for the new stuff coming out next year.",
        "My all time favorite anime series.  It's difficult to explain and must be seen to enjoy its creativity and cleverness.  This is one of best ways to show the strides GAINAX is making as well as other greats like Evangelion, Gunbuster, and others.Almost everyone in this series undergoes change especially Naota.  I finally watched episode 5 and 6 and I never picked up on the role of Naota's brother.  How about lefties, sour and sweet, or mild or spicy??  \"Brittle Bullet\" may be my new favorite...how can you not be amazed by its final scene and the rich color schemes.  Haruko is epitome of female anime coolness and she looks so creepy with that smile and no eyes!  Mamimi's manic self always brings a laugh and who wouldn't want their own Canti? Great secondary characters who just add more to the richness of the story. And a heavy emphasis on EYEBROWS. The show is linear but tangents are strewn throughout which makes this a great series and repeated viewings.  I probably still won't get it, but I think it's meant to kick back, relax, and enjoy the show.  Also, FLCL would not be the same without the Pillows soundtrack which fits perfect with the show.  The end credit sequence makes you want to get a vespa.For those who enjoy originality, terrific tunes, and just so bizarre it's tasty anime to munch up.",
        "FLCL is a mix of reality intermingled with the imaginings of a 12 yr. old boy. In a stream of consciousness that flows into a stream of sub-consciousness we follow a 12 yr. old boy through his life. Sometimes adventures, sometimes normal, sometimes utterly crazy and insane.(MINOR SPOILER) In one episode (the last one?) he sees a corpse which was behind the curtain which drapes the kitchen sink. He doesn't react for a second. You see the rotting flesh and know what it is. But suddenly the boy is screaming, running off down the hall with the corpse clinging to his back.I was scared like that once and remember thinking \"it's right behind me and about to jump on me!\" And so his imaginings become part of the episode w/o the audience being told this is what he is imagining - what he is going through in his head.The constant stream of juxtaposed images is extremely well done. The technique is done as well as it can get. Many styles of animation are thrown together in a pleasing blend which lead you along - if you let them. Looking for a rational flow of information is not going to happen. Here you must let it come to you... just like life. 10/10-Zafoid",
        "Rating: 5.9Favorite Episode: FurikuraA coming of age story about puberty and mechs, guitars, portals, unrequited love, manipulation, etc.. This is akin to Evangelion as the plot and presentation is so sporadic and interpretive it's difficult to get a handle on what's going on. Most of the appeal comes from its unorthodox presentation of its themes and metaphors like Naota hitting the satellite symbolizing him facing his fears and taking an active approach in his life, it's also a sex metaphor as when Naota swings his bat all the girls lose it and Naota also comments \"If he rushes he won't be able to get it up\". But other than that it was a mess. Plot points like: Why some people have portals in there heads, why is Medical Mechanica \"omniciding\" planets, how a powerful being like Atomsk got captured, why Naota jumping into canti allows him to control it, why guitars are used as weapons etc. Were poorly explained and rushed, a show shouldn't require a dissertation of interpretation to comprehend. At that point, it's convoluted.",
        "I have to stop saying \"Best Anime Show I've Ever Seen\" because I'm always finding better ones, so I'm saying \"One of the best\". Anyways, This is seriously one of the best animes I've ever seen. At first when Adult Swim aired this, I thought that this show was confusing and had no plot. But now that I actually had an interest in the show, I found out it was because I didn't pay attention to it last time and now I did.This was a very exciting anime and I'm sad that It's over. They need to go up for another season. What happens to everyone? How about the high school chick? Harakuo or whatever her name is. It leaves us to wonder..I recommend this anime for all anime lovers out there. You don't know what you are missing. Best six episodes ever seen.",
        "FLCL is a great anime with many deep rooted themes and meanings, however it also can be interpreted as pure insanity and honestly does not need to be known as anything else. FLCL has dynamic animation and designs. With a great soundtrack and great writing, the show feels super enjoyable to watch. FLCL is an anime that can be analyzed forever or not at all.",
        "I read the Manga, and didn't like it so I thought maybe the show would be better, but it's just as bad if not worse than the manga. The story makes absolutely no sense, and while it is supposed to be one of those nonsensical, doesn't make sense stories until the end, the least they could have done was give more information so that you didn't feel as lost and confused. I know a lot of people like this series, but I just couldn't get into it. The humor is there, but the story is not. It's just a shallow and boring experience that is not worth your time or your energy.",
        "This is another one of those Love/Hate anime's, encapsulated by the first episode.\nIt's intro is strange bordering on insane, seems to make little sense and you're left wondering what's next as the credits roll.Of course the following episodes include more insanity but slowly the story begins to unfold.\nThe series even manages to squeeze in a few \"coming of age\" tropes in a way that feels natural, which is saying something in a anime about a guitar swinging space alien taking advantage of a poor middle school kid.Only the viewer can decide which passion they'll feel, maybe I'm wrong but can't see many people being indifferent to FLCL.Pro's:\nDistinct art style.Unique story.Not predictable.English dubbing.Unlike anything else.Con's:\nNot of a fan of the really bizarre art style during the \"wacky\" portions.",
        "I knew this anime was bound for greatness, but I had no idea it'd be this good. When I saw the promos, I was a little confused, but when I saw the show first - hand, it was worth it. It was really confusing, but that's the fun of this anime... plus its several pop culture references. (like last night when they mentioned Crystal Pepsi.) I laughed the hardest when I saw the first episode and they showed an extremely fast manga animation! Although it's only 6 episodes long, this anime is worth a look.",
        "Here's a tip relevant especially to FLCL. Ordinarily I despise anime dubbing, but as I watched the final two hours of FLCL words flew so fast and furious that I had to experiment. First thing I found was FLCL's dubbing isn't awful: no twenty-year-old voices from forty-year-old mouths. Even so, something was missing.My solution went like this. (1) Turn on both English subtitles and English audio. The two never match, and FLCL is no exception. A maximum information, more than from either alone, comes from both played against each other. (2) Make a point of switching back to Japanese at regular intervals so as not to lose important rhythms.Other than that, FLCL is superb, wildly Freudian (or something along that line), and, for its electric guitars, one of three great musically based anime I can think of at the moment. The others, of course, are Cowboy Bebop (but not its awful movie) and Samurai Champloo.",
        "Liked by guys who saw it on Toonami when they were babies and were impressed by the pretty colors. Basically like Cowboy Bebop in that way. Flashy trash.",
        "This anime is a 12 Year old boy who meets an alien who wields a guitar.It is animated by Gainax and written by Yoji Enokido.It is a very fluid and well animated anime series. It is action packed and full of colour. It has the best animation that I have seen.The anime takes part in the town that is seemingly, isolated from society. The plot is a little weak and it makes very little sense.The supporting characters are often pushed away to make room for the main characters so the Main characters are nearly always on the screen.I found the Dub much better than the Sub and I would definitely recommend this anime to anime lovers.",
        "I may not be an otaku (heck, I cannot stand otaku!), but I know good animation when I see it, and FLCL is not. What kind of Anime is it suppose to be? Action? Sci-Fi? Comedy? Hentai/porn? PWP (no plot) anime? If you said No plot, you are right!There is ugly character designs, no plot, no characterization, no real funny humor, just humor ripped off from \"South Park\" and \"Beavis and Butthead\", only worse. Though Excel Saga got pretty bizarre, at least it was ORIGINAL! And though Excel's plot was simplistic, it was still better than the plot in this! No wonder it lasted six episodes!When will Gainax do a GOOD show? They haven't yet so far *sigh*",
        "Welcome to Fooly Cooly, GAINAX's worst idea ever!  This braindead cartoon has no plot, horrible animation, and has some of the worst characters in existence, with no background, personality, or anything.  You have some weird, pink haired girl smash stuff, a kid with robots flying through his forehead, and a robot dog!  With little originality, and weird visuals, you have to wonder what the show's creator was smoking at the time this was created.BOTTOM LINE:  I have one thing to say to Adult Swim:  GET RID OF THIS NOW!!!!",
        "Furikuri it's a really great series, with a really good phasing, really good animation, A great soundtrack and with a really deep message after you rewatch it.",
        "Is so damn enjoyable, and actually has a deeper message of what means of being Adult, I love every single frame of it, the characters, the music, animationEVERYTHING ITS GREAT.",
        "A show that runs on pure emotion and adrenaline. Truly a once in a lifetime experience.",
        "FLCL is so worth a watch, if you're at all interested you'd be doing yourself a favor to check it out. It's got feels, it's got heart, it's got a moving and rockin' score by band The Pillows. It's not about some kind of weirdness value like you're maybe thinking, it's a unique work of art that just might click with you.FLCL is a coming of age story that immerses us in the topsy turvy world of a teenage lad. And does it better than most movies or shows I've seen trying to tackle it, at least for me. It tackles that awkwardness and sadness with a sense of fun and adventure, among many other great things about FLCL.One of my favorites, and really just thinking about it is moving to me, I think FLCL will stand the test of time very well."

    "One Outs": [
        "Look don't get me wrong, I like my psychological genre type of anime and appreciate Madhouse for producing pretty great anime. However, I just felt after watching a few episodes that it just didn't click with me. It could be the fact I'm just not interested in baseball and like I've watched some good sports anime such as Haikyuu!!, Yowamushi Pedal and Free! so far. Hate valleyball, rusty with cycling and need to swim again but yet, those three anime were actually intriguing to watch!Just unfortunately, One Outs isn't part of my approved list...",
        "One of my friends suggested this anime when I was frantically asking around for other anime once I finished Death Note. I didn't have high hopes from it, but that was before I got sucked into the intense mind manipulation by the title character, Tokuchi Toua !! He reminds me of Yagami Light or L, as you please, and has a stark contrast from other genius level characters with an aloof, whimsical, arrogant and devilish nature. The only one aspect in which the anime could have improved was to have a little bit of back story on the title character, but nevertheless, doesn't take away the shine from an extremely solid and well built plot. For sports fans, this will take you to another level and I guarantee you, this will NOT disappoint !!",
        "One-outs is criminally underrated. The show basically revolves around Tokuchi Toa (who is one of the most intelligent and tactful Anime characters), and brings out how thorough manipulation of mind can devastate any champion player in the world. Take a bow Tokuchi..\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\nWhat I thoroughly enjoyed was the way Baseball and human behaviour have been linked together. The amount of vision and thought that has gone into making this show is phenomenal. Not to forget the amazing opening song..\ud83d\udd25\nThis literally deserves a second season..\nJust amazing..\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb",
        "You would not think that gambling and baseball works good together, but this anime proved me wrong. When the story really began it was mind-blowing. You would think that it would get worse over time, but it was great until the end.\nThe side characters may be a little unnecessary, but the main character...oh lord that guy. Fantastic.Go watch it! Start at 10 o'clock in the morning and finish it in the same day.",
        "This anime is all about strategies and manipulation or showing the baseball club dark world business",
        "One of the most amazing anime I have watched. The show is crisp and will keep you at the edge till the last. Every episode will make you crave for more. Please come up with season 2",
        "There's something captivating about watching someone constantly outwit those who want to bring him down. The main character Tokuchi is smooth, arrogant, and always out-thinking anyone who thinks they have him cornered, battling his enemies in their minds and sometimes flat out breaking people with how much he can beat them in a game of wits. The show is clever in how it ramps up the ways in which it backs Tokuchi into a corner with seemingly no way out, or thwarts his first plan only to reveal it was a feint or he had a backup all along. The series ends in a sort of weird place and I wish more of the manga had been adapted, but as I'm left wanting more I'd say that's a good mark for the show. My biggest criticism is that the supporting cast behind Tokuchi, with the exception of his catcher, can be at times dumb or boring with how far behind Tokuchi's thinking they can lag. Overall though it was a ride I enjoyed start to finish and while partly because I love baseball, I think this is something for anyone who enjoys a good bit of deduction or psychological battles rather than physical ones.",
        "Since this is my first review, I cannot profess to know what I'm talking about, but know that this is my honest opinion about this anime: I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! Sorry for screaming it out to you, but this is how I feel. My dear friend who gave me the instruction to watch this is forever in my debt. For a young woman such as myself, that has no interest in baseball whatsoever, to non-stop watch 25 episodes of One Outs is in itself a statement of how intriguing, fun and clever this work of animation is.It is not a simple work of entertainment, it is an entertaining anime that commands you to think. Each and every character has their own unique personality, with of course Tokuchi being the smartest man both off and on the baseball field.In the end, all the elements that compelled me to watch it, the intelligence, the pride, the money, the attitude and the teamwork, all of it made me long for more once I reached the final episode. And yet, I'm perfectly content with how it ended.So don't hesitate, just watch it and love it!",

    "Ouran High School Host Club": [
        "I have not read the mange nor watched the anime. So, this was my first time picking up Ouran High School Host Club and it did feel like watching an anime.As it is a parody (I think) the characters and the events are copy paste from the classic shoujo manga trops that can be found in the genre. However, I did find the acting a bit over the top, as well as the some scenes. But the settings and the clothes seemed quite good and it looked as if the production had really invested in the representation of the Ouran High School.Overall, the story was cute, although you have to watch the movie to conclude it. The romance was kind of off as well, even though the love triangle was good.So, five out of ten."

    "Death Note": [
        "This is a super-difficult anime series to describe--especially to those who are not anime lovers. This is because the plot is so totally bizarre and complex, but I'll take a stab at it: I death god (\"Ryuk\") is bored, so he drops a death notebook randomly to see what occurs when a mortal finds it. A brilliant high school student, Light, finds it and soon realizes that if he writes a person's name in it and concentrates on the face of that person, then they will die! At first, Light uses this notebook to kill off the evil scum of the world and he becomes a pop hero--though no one knows who is doing these murders or how they are done. Eventually, the police decide that murdering these scum is bad and try to put a stop to it (why, I don't know--he is performing a community service).At this point, most viewers will likely side with Light and the story isn't all that compelling. However, the writing is brilliant, as Light slowly transforms from a well-meaning young man to someone with a god complex--and a person willing to kill ANYONE--whether they deserve it or not. The anime really has a lot to say about the notion of power corrupting, though I would sure be willing to use a death notebook to see if I would be corrupted (look out DMV workers with an attitude and trial lawyers, here I come!).As is typical of any anime, the original manga is slightly different and the live-action movie is even more different yet. I advise you to give the series a try or watch the first movie (which is even better). Even if you are not a huge anime fan (and I am NOT), you'll enjoy it if you are willing to give it a try with an open mind.",
        "After bored Shinigami (god of death) Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world it is found by an equally bored school boy named Light Yagami. Light soon discovers that the instructions in the note book aren't a joke and any name he writes in it will die! He believes that he can use it to bring justice to the world and soon killers are dropping like flies shortly after their details are made public. It isn't long before it becomes clear to law enforcement agencies that somebody must be behind the mysterious deaths and they work to discover who alongside a mysterious detective known only as 'L'. The public also realise what is going on and the killer is given the nickname Kira (Killer). As the series progresses Light plays a game of cat and mouse with the police; at times it looks certain that he is caught and at others it seems that he can get away with anything even when he is enlisted to help the police.This is a really gripping series that even those who aren't a fan of animation should be able to enjoy. The plot is tight with all the rules of the Death Note explained so we aren't left wondering about possible problems are two people sharing a name and such like. Light is a great protagonist; he is clearly becomes psychotic and frequently kills sympathetic characters just because he fears they could expose him. While this is very much a drama there are some enjoyably light moments such as Ryuk's craving for apples. At thirty seven episodes the series may seem a little long but it needs that long to tell the story\u0085 in never seems rushed nor does it feel like any episodes are there just to pad things out. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of anime or supernatural thrillers\u0085 and don't worry if you've already seen the live action version; this deviates from that story and has a totally different ending; an ending that I wasn't certain about till I saw it; as the penultimate episode ended I had no idea whether he'd get away with it or not!These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "Death Note (2006-7) is a 37 episode series I recently watched with my daughter on Hulu. The storyline focuses on a young man who discovers a book that upon touching unveils a Yugami that only he can see. The Yugami is a demon like creature that instructs him on the rules now that he has opened the book, one of which is every name written in the book leads to the person's death. A task force is identified to track down the young man when they start seeing patterns in his killings. A series of cat and mouse ensues between the young man and law enforcement. My daughter and I loved this series. The dialogue is great and the characters are both entertaining and frustrating. I couldn't help but think that the Netflix series Money Heist must have stole a lot of ideas from this series. There are a lot of clever aspects to this storyline and unpredictable moments. I also loved the animation style. Overall, this is an entertaining series that is entertaining for both adults and teenagers. I strongly recommend watching this and would score it a 9/10.",
        "Light, a Japanese high school student, finds a so-called Death Note, that enables the user to kill people by writing their names in it. He sets about cleansing the world of evil, while the police try to determine who he is... and stop him. This is the first anim\u00e9 series I watch, so I can't draw comparisons to others. It gets extremely visual at times, but at least half of the time, it isn't, particularly. The focus is on the writing, the twists, the mind games. There is a lot of cat-and-mouse going on, and we follow the investigation. Thankfully, both the law enforcement and our young lead are rather smart, so it is a very even match, and quite interesting to follow. In fact, at its best, this keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you'll find yourself watching multiple episodes in a row. At least until about the halfway point, after when it, at times, seems to not particularly move forward(and it suddenly decides to follow something that hasn't been brought up at all prior to that point, and sometimes soon after stops doing so). There are a few plot threads that go nowhere, or that could have been removed to tighten this up. The characters vary... L is awesome, definitely. We do have some that are clearly mainly comic relief, and yes, this does have a little of the silly humor that can be found in a lot of mainstream manga. The animation is nicely done, with some stunning moments and impeccable style. There is brutal, bloody, violent content in this. I recommend it to those who like the concept and want to see it explored, or anyone who enjoys this kind of detective thriller. 8/10.",
        "\"Death Note\" is simply one of the best anime series from the recent years, having an outstanding animation, very interesting characters and a magnificent plot, filled with many unpredictable and surprising plot twists, keeping a high level of tension from the beginning until the ending of the story.The main premise of this series was pretty attractive and very well developed, making a great use of some supernatural elements in a realistic context.The motivations and psychology of the characters are portrayed in a very convincing manner: Their complex personality's serves as the main core of the plot development, resulting in one of the most fascinating mystery series ever made in the history of television.The animation is simply excellent: Not only the character's designs are beautifully made (Having all those designs many subtle details which are able to combine realism with the stylish characteristics from the anime aesthetic) but also has a flawless atmosphere, which captures perfectly well the overall mood of this series. The use of colors and light effects is equally brilliant, keeping a high quality level in all the episodes. The voice acting and the music are pretty effective, complementing the greatness of the plot and the animation.\"Death Note\" deserved all the hype and praise that it received, being one of the most brilliant television shows that I've ever watched. It would be the perfect series if it wasn't for one little detail: Misa Amane. She is one of the most annoying characters ever made, and she feels totally out of place in the context of this series. I know that there is too much hate directed toward other characters (Such as Mello and Near) but none of them were so irritating and dumb as Misa. Maybe is just me, but I feel like this character were from a completely different anime, and that's the main reason why I don't like her very much.Other than that, this is a magnificent series, which I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't seen this yet.",
        "Without a doubt the best anime series I've ever watched.It was very clever, there were some nonsense of course, but I ignored them. This serial was very good.. The music was also good. But the last episodes were so bad, I didn't like the finale either.",
        "I'm not an anime fan at all, simply because I've never given it much chance but also because the few times I have, it's just not for me. But a friend heavily pushed me to see this, and I'm glad I did. It's an anime TV show that I could see having influence on many of the dramas going on right now (Breaking Bad perhaps as one of them). I saw the dubbed version, but the voice acting was pretty spectacular. It hits some rough spots, the second half or so (after the first 15 or so episodes) isn't as great as the first half, but the final two episodes are magnificent and end the series on a very high note. This is definitely recommended, it's full of extremely moral dilemmas.",
        "On the first 10 episodes, I thought Death Note was rather interesting and different. I have heard of it before until 6 years later, I went onto YouTube and finally got around watching it. Although as I watched the 10 episodes and the second Kira Misa appeared, I just lost interest. I even lost interest because they were still looking for the real Kira. I had to skip the 26 episodes and I got to the final episode. I was actually so sad that Light died. He was such a hottie good or bad. Omg his sidekick Ryuk was so creepy, every time he appeared, I had to look away. I know he's meant to be scary but for god sakes, he doesn't blink or show any emotions, it gives me bloody chills when a cartoon character looks like that haha! I wouldn't call this my favorite anime but I would call it an anime to remember!",
        "This anime had such an interesting premise. Is killing all evil the right thing to do? Light becomes obsessed at the end.",
        "I watched first 6 (out of 37) episodes and I'm hooked. Although this type of animation goes on my nerves, it's not as bad as in other anime I encountered so far, and the story is so good that I have to see it through, no matter retarded looks of Shinigami and all the other flaws of the genre. This would be excellent feature thriller, either movie or series. If possible, in Japanese or European production, although I doubt even Hollywood could screw it too much. But, speculation on the side, in this form, I rate it8/10As the series progressed, I was more and more tempted to give it a 9, or even 10, but the last episode was a real disappointment. Someone who has been living a triple life for six years and playing the game at such a high level would not make such an amateur mistake. I knew they will get him eventually, but I was expecting some highly intelligent mindfak, not the outworn cliche of a villain exulting in the face of the enemy before his plan succeeded. Final rating8,5/10",
        "This series is a boundless wonder, it is one of the most beautiful cartoons that exist. The plot is wonderful, the characters are all characterized to perfection and in general the series manages to keep you in tension throughout its duration, too bad the ending is slightly pulled away.",
        "Japanese Manga (comic book) artists Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata did not know the phenomenon they were about to unleash upon the world when they created \"Death Note,\" which intricately blends elements of fantasy, horror, and the murder mystery into one deeply mystifying and engaging piece of art. It was serialized in Japan's \"Weekly Shonen Jump\" magazine before being given a green-light for a Madhouse-produced OVA series in 2006.The story finds its main character in Light Yagami, a bored Japanese high school honor student who one day accidentally discovers the \"Death Note,\" a notebook of otherworldly origin that gives him the ability to kill anyone whose name is written in it. (The Death Note originally belonged to the rogue shinigami - death god - Ryuk, who was bored himself and wanted to see what kind of havoc could be wreaked upon the world of the living.)After a little trial & error, Light begins to see the virtues of what has been dropped into his possession. At first, he uses the Death Note to rid the world of evil, by eliminating many of society's worst criminals. So in short order, Light goes from being a bored high school honor student to a serial killer with delusions of godhood (he's later named \"Kira\" - \"killer\" - by fans of his work). Light's actions are not without consequence, however. Thus, the story adds two wrinkles: It doesn't take long for the authorities to find out that the deaths are somehow connected, and a police investigation is launched. Wrinkle #2 comes in the form of Light playing a cat & mouse game with the authorities and the mysterious and reclusive criminal investigator L, who has vowed to find out who is behind these mysterious deaths and how they're getting away with it.Having never read the original Manga, I can easily say without any bias that the show has to be a perfect (and logical) elevation for \"Death Note.\" This is one Anime' that really caught my eye, since I saw it on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim late one night, and I've constantly been barraged by the Anime' DVDs and original Manga at the local bookstore. So I took a chance and I can say that \"Death Note\" is now one of my favorite Anime' shows from Japan.This is a moody, effective, and stunningly envisioned and intelligent Anime'. Being a fan of Anime' myself, I know firsthand that intelligence is never in short order in this genre. The story twists and turns and goes a great many places that are incredibly hard to predict. Also as a fan of fantasy, I'm glad to see that \"Death Note\" is pretty dark fantasy, and paints a rather chilling view of a world where the lines between life and death have become so blurred that it seems the two coexist. This show is fairly disturbing, with a very disturbed lead character who lives in a world of amorality and is hard to connect with, but he is such a strange and intriguing character, nonetheless.I hope that wherever \"Death Note\" goes, it goes to some place good because, after all, once we're gone, all that we'll have in the end is the Death Note.10/10",
        "Death Note is a highly acclaimed anime series that presents a unique and compelling story. The story revolves around a notebook falling from the sky, which enables a human to kill an individual whose name is written in it. The protagonist, Yagami Light, uses this power to create a utopia where he is god and punishes criminals for a perfect society. However, the question remains whether killing individuals who have done wrong and will do so again is right. Death Note raises complex moral questions and challenges viewers' morals, making it a highly acclaimed anime series. The series' first 15 episodes are filled with suspense as the characters' methods for identifying each other are explored. However, the second arc is criticized for being unnecessary and potentially causing the series to lose some of its luster. If rated separately, the first would receive a 15/10 rating, while the second would receive a 9/10 rating. Despite these flaws, Death Note's intelligent story deserves an overall 10/10 rating.Anime characters Light and L are fascinating and intelligent, possessing a captivating yet insane personality. They are an appealing pick for the game because of their distinct and endearing qualities. A confusing and reckless disaster, Light's calm, calculating figure is propelled by his ambition of conquest with the Death Note. His metamorphosis from a cool, collected figure to a rambunctious mess is a clear example of his character development; other characters also exhibit this, albeit less dramatically.",
        "When asked the question; \"what is the best anime,\" Death Note should be in the conversation. This show is GRIPPING. The viewer is almost always on the edge of their seat. The characters are very, very intelligent and capable in their roles.It's an awesome show.",
        "Even people who aren't into anime may know what Death Note is. It's a franchise that's turned people into fans of the medium. For me, this series has a damn-fine story told throughout its 37 episodes. We're introduced to bored high-school student Light Yagami comes across a book simply branded with 'Death Note'. And the book's power is that 'the human whose name is written in this note shall die'. And the book does just that. Now Light is stuck with this book, along with its owner: Ryuk the 'shinigami'. After using the Death Note to kill some petty criminals, Light starts a crusade to vanquish evil, and 'will become the god of this new world': Kira.Death Note is well done, and becomes a fun ride and more complicated one, when its best character, 'L' (we never know his real name), is brought into the story in Episode 2 and is Light's equal. And 'L' is my favourite part of the show. He's smart, can outguess even himself in the most outrageous circumstances, and he's completely unpredictable. You can also never tell what he's really thinking; but he fights for JUSTICE! This dynamic is akin to James Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes, Ernst Blofeld and James Bond, The Joker and Batman; Light and L are no exception to these great rivalries.The story of Death Note is masterfully adapted to the television storytelling format, it looks just like its source-comic book ('manga': as they call comics in Japan) and its amazing cast of characters makes the show easily worth a watch from start to finish.You want to watch anime but don't know where to start? Well, start here. You'll thank me later.",
        "It was a rewarding experience to rewatch this classic. However, \"Death Note\" follows the classic tragedy of many shows where it falls flat towards the ending. To be frank, it starts going downhill after L's death. The two characters brought in to \"replace\" L could not reach the level of his character. I understand that the manga is slightly different in terms of character building and pace but I think it became harder to watch in part 2 of this anime. The plot became pretty complex even before L's death but at certain point I just couldn't keep track of all the death notes with different ownership and such.But outside of its shortfall towards the end, I felt it was excellent. It's such a good premise and throws interesting questions about justice and morality. Light is probably one of the best characters ever written. He's a great example of a villain that is easy to get attached to because his purpose seems somewhat just on the outside. He's extremely charismatic to the point of a cult leader and his only downfall would be hubris. He also makes a real impact in the world dropping crime rate down. Whether this is effective or not is debatable, but it still balances out the reasons why someone would hate him or love him. His game of wit with L was truly masterful writing and I enjoyed it very much.I also loved its dark atmosphere and music. The soundtrack is actually so amazing that I do listen to it on a regular basis. It maintained a consistent quality to the anime itself and we always appreciate that. Overall, I very much enjoyed \"Death Note\" and appreciate all of its characters but I just wish it didn't fall flat. But I would certainly recommend it to anyone despite its shortcomings.",
        "Though this is different from the genre of anime I normally watch, I was blown away by Death Note's execution and original, inventive storyline. I had always been intrigued by its concept of a notebook that can kill anyone whose name is entered in it, and that alone was enough to convince me to watch this supernatural crime thriller anime, and it was just outstanding! I've just now finished watching all episodes on Netflix, and I kind of feel blank.The show raises a lot of moral questions about justice, capital punishment and vigilantism in a very plausible manner. Instead of giving us clearly defined hero, the anime gives us a rather complex protagonist we might even have trouble rooting for at times. It's a first-rate thriller, and a powerful character study at the same time. Throughout the 37 episodes, the show gives you edge of the seat suspense and intriguing twists, as a result of which it becomes very addictive and hard to stop watching. Action scenes, although present only in a few episodes, are done really well and the dialogue is intelligent. And yes, the soundtrack elevates this show to a whole new level of excitement. I couldn't help but listen to the intro music every time I picked up to continue watching the show.No doubt this anime has been such a success with the viewers and has left a memorable impact. To anime fans who enjoy crime thrillers with a supernatural twist, this is definitely recommended, but adults who enjoy live-action shows dealing with similar topics can watch it as well, because it's only the format of the show that's animated. The story is very well mature and intelligent enough to be enjoyed by someone who doesn't even watch animation in general. Fun fact: Having known I'd love the show, I'd got myself a copy of the Death Note (notebook) in advance. No wonder it's a memorabilia for me now!",
        "This anime succeeded my expectations! I heard about this anime,but didn't pay attention to it because I thought it was just another anime about demons! It is true it has an supernatural element to it! But for the most part this anime is a thriller! And a very good one! I have seen 21 episodes now (i think there are five left) and the tension only is building up! This anime is full of twists and turns and is very exciting to watch! As the story goes on matters get more complex,more people get involved. But the main reason to watch this show is because of the mind battle between \"Light\" and \"L\"! \"L\" is a special agent in charge of the \"Kira\" case! \"Kira\" kills criminals in order to make the world a better place! (The way he does it is a real mystery for the police but not for the viewers because we know kira is using \"the death note\")! \"Light\" is \"Kira\" and knows that \"L\" is close in capturing him! Of course \"Light\" wants \"L\" dead so he can continue his quest! And \"L\" wants to stop \"Kira\"! Each time when they get close to their goals they outsmart each other! You don't know what to expect!This is such a thrilling experience! This anime is tense and serious but also manages to throw in some humor to lighten up matters! I am hooked! Go watch this anime immediately!Seen all 37 episodes (28june2007)! A good ending! But I would have ended the series earlier (after episode 25)! Than the ending would have been more powerful and satisfying! Still it is one hell of an anime!",
        "I am glad to see that despite the average of 9.0 from numerous voters... there are still many people here who can look at this anime series from an objective point of view and openly state its flaws.No need for me to go into details or spoilers at all. I've seen about every Death Note there is to see (aside from the 2017 American series which I refuse to watch just on principle). Like many here I understand the Death Note concept and found the original move to be a masterpiece.But this anime... it was like packing a 2 hour movie into a 14 hour slow-motion treadmill. As pointed out by several others-- plot concepts were repeated, concepts thrown in and then ignored, and by the 20th episode I was feeling like Ryuk... bored bored bored. Although well-presented, this felt like nothing more than someone trying to drag out the original story lines to as many episodes as they could possibly milk. But the cow ran dry long before the series ended.Filled with gaping plot holes, lack of logic, areas of ridiculous complexity and jump-the-shark \"logic\"... this felt like an old Charlie Chan movie mystery where one person says \"I have won because\" and the other person says \"Except I foresaw that and\" and then the first person says \"But I knew you foresaw it so I\" and then the second person... well, you get the idea. Savvy viewers can only handle so much of that stuff before they start thinking \"seriously?\".The gore in the very final episode was unprecedented in the series, gratuitous and totally unnecessary to ending the story. There was a strong feeling of anti-climax pretty much through the entire last half of the series (if not before). I started questioning where they were going somewhere after the 10th episode. At the 20th episode I was asking \"how long are they going to drag this on?\". By the time we got to episode 30 I had given up all hope and watched the rest on sheer \"closure\" factor-- let's get this watched and over with.One major mistake in production which I don't understand (probably had something to do with legal rights) was the change in the theme song about halfway through. They went from a barely-tolerable beginning and end song to a total-trash, super-heavy-metal theme song that sounded like it came out of some stoner's garage band. If the purpose of that \"music\" was to convince us there are insane people in the world... it was a total success. I like just about all kinds of music, but that second theme song was a loser in both concept and performance and did nothing to support the series. It turned Death Note into Dead Note and was a terrible choice for theme music.One scene especially (no spoilers) where someone was going to murder two people in cold blood to eliminate Kira-- all I can say is the writers must have been smoking weed when they came up with that lame concept. That didn't make any sense from any viewpoint, and certainly was not Death Note. They had a shark jump the shark on that one.In the end the series was way too long, too contrived in plot, and had too many unbelievable points and logic flaws to stand up to examination. No matter how much someone may have enjoyed the original Death Note movie, if viewed honestly this anime just doesn't stand up to the standards of good anime or the Death Note concept either one. I'm a great fan of the original 2006 movie... but I was yawning 2/3 of the way through this series. The story line was forced and mediocre at best. As I've stated with a couple of other Death Note wannabe's... we don't need yet another Death Note; the original was just fine.",
        "Start really great.\naddictive binger.\nprobably lasted too long.\nstill, great soundtrack and ideas.\nvery recommended.",
        "Funny, yet entertaining!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "Well, at least almost nothing. 20+ episodes is just way too much of pointless conversations in combination with more or less interesting twists. If it would have been condensed into half it could have been a good show. There is suspense, thrill, depth, intelligence and moral but also randomness, repetition, cliche and shallowness. Maybe I miss the point of my 1st anime series but from a pure entertainment side it's in my POV average at best.",
        "After re-watching this again, I'm reminded how brilliant this anime was. Everything was there, the plot, the cinematography, the character development, the directing. Plus there was a lot of philosophy about morality, and life & death.Light was compelling at the meticulous killer for justice, Kira. In fact, the first episode with him is what draws you in. L was brilliant. There was something sad about L. L's death episode was very sad and good, tho I was disappointed they killed him off. He was a very deep character. The relationship between L and Light is almost like a love affair. They are frenemies. If it wasn't for Light's dark path that he chose, you get a sense they could be best friends, maybe more. Notice Light nor L ever really seemed interested in women. Light pretended with Misa Misa and Kiyomi. I got man-crush vibes from these two in their cat and mouse game.Misa Amane was annoying as hell. Yet I think deliberately so. She's a twit, yet very clever too. I think her screeching was the worst though. Uh boy. Ryuki, the Shinigami was hilarious and one of my favorite characters. Aizawa was probably the most interesting out of the police force team along with Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Matsuda really was an idiot, lol. Mikami's life story and role were really good, I thought.I think the series falters when they kill off L and bring in Near. There was no depth to Near, and he comes off as a smug little...um..something, and frankly robotic. He seems like a weak imitation of L. Why have an imitation when you can have the real thing? I think the ending was really good with Light finally getting caught. But I think it should have been written with L being the one to finally catch him. The series tries to promote that Near and Mello were really like L, so therefore L is the one that caught him. But this came off as very weak reasoning. I suspect that was written to \"make it ok\" that Near was the replacement for L. Yeah, nobody bought that.More weak writing when it's revealed that Mello teamed up with Near to finally catch Kira. It was like, did I blink and miss something? There was no developmental path that occurred that would suggest that Mello would suddenly change, or would even be willing to die to get Kira. In fact, the writing after L was killed wasn't as good as before that event. I wouldn't say it was awful, but just weak, and jarring with the sudden introduction of many new characters. Also, they wrote Light as being not as smart as Near and it became a bit cringeworthy in that sense. There are good parts after L, but the series just didn't have the same compelling dynamic afterward.Finally, there's the philosophy. I suspect a lot of people would agree with Kira. That evil people should be killed. But though one can understand the sentiment, especially if you are a victim, or family of a victim, the problem with it is that some people CAN be rehabilitated and can become good productive citizens. Sometimes there are extenuating circumstances, as well as social constructs such as extreme poverty, not to mention mental illness situations. Also, there ARE people who are charged and/or in jail that are innocent. To further demonstrate how wrong Light was, he DID kill good people such as the FBI agents and others that were working on the case. He made the mistake of thinking he was God, and his extreme hubris left no room for love & compassion for all of humanity. This is why he was evil. He was a psychopath. 10/10. (I thought about giving a 9 but took into account the overall awesomeness of the series.)",
        "The Death Note manga is a socialist artwork between a painter and a writer. But in fact the person who is credited with elevating this manga to such status is the writer and author (Tsujumi Oba). This person weaved an interwoven plot with strong and pivotal turns at all times, and even made sure that his plot was wrapped in a difficult police character. Unlike all other police work, Death Note is one of those works that took the general concept of policing and transformed it completely to serve a different purpose. These plots are known to be a group of benevolent characters, pursuing a group or another evil person. And in these plots, the matter is not personal or mostly psychological. But in this work of art, the matter took over time personal curves that led to unexpected turns in the plot.Therefore, when we transfer the axes of the plot from the general axes of all the characters to the private axes of two particular characters, we are really here to make matters completely personal, and the personalization of the situation here led to pushing each of them to exert all possible effort and strength in order to achieve victory, whatever the cost or means. Made for it. In this anime, the writer placed the chase between (person) and (person). And each of them has a very high IQ, and each of them is able to carry out the most heinous crimes without leaving a trace of him, and even turn the tables on their owners at any moment. But one of them chose the path of truth, and the other chose the path of falsehood. Now in this anime, we see literally two people who can be called (god) in relation to cunning and the ability to reach the end by harnessing the capabilities of the mind. Here we witness the struggles of the ancient (Olympian) gods once again on the ground, but with false identities and endless pursuits. And between this and that, we find that events escalate and the plot begins to twist little by little until we find ourselves in front of mind-blowing events and fueling emotions in an unimaginable way.",
        "Light Yagami, an intelligent high school student, embarks on a crusade of secrecy after finding a notebook known as the Death Note, which gives him the power to kill anyone when their name is written inside of it. He attempts to rule the world, killing criminals by writing their names in the Death Note. A Shinigami (a \"death god\") possess a Death Note and can only be seen by a person who uses it. Ryuk is Light's Shinigami, and the two (neither friend nor foe) journey together as Light attempts to take out every bad guy and ultimately by God of a new world. But trouble arouses when a brilliant detective, known as L, takes on the case and begins to outwit Light. A triumph in the manga world. The show always keeps its audience on edge and their ceases to be a dull moment. Merciless to the end, the characters are very three-dimensional and the story is satisfyingly unpredictable. In a tale with such a controversial main character, it finds itself explaining (or justifying) things through dialogue instead of action, which kind of feels like we as the audience are being underestimated. Perhaps maybe some of us are, as there tends to be a line between the fans who support and who are against Light Yagami. A truly powerful series.***\u00bd"

    "KILL la KILL": [
        "This series follows protagonist Ryuko Matoi as she joins the Honnouji Academy; a school dominated by head of the student council Satsuki Kiryuin; she rules with the help of the 'Elite Four'. They maintain discipline with an iron fist and transgressors are severely punished or even executed! Their influence isn't limited to the school; where a family lives is dependent on their child's status in the school. The senior pupils are able to dominate the others because of the 'life fibres' woven into their clothing; these give the wearers amazing powers. Ryuko however has her own special uniform; it is sentient and made entirely of Life Fibres; using this she plans to take on the ruling elite and ultimately discover who is responsible for the death of her father.This series is over the top crazy\u0085 that is the whole point of it! The fighting takes up most of the run time; amazingly each fight seems to be bigger than the last until ultimately it is a battle to save all of humanity! These fights are largely played for laughs although it is clear that the characters could get hurt and sometimes do. As the series progresses the plot advances nicely and there are some nice twists along the way. The costumes are fairly skimpy but the animation style means it is mocking fan service rather than pandering to it. This style is quite different to most anime; backgrounds are imaginative but less detailed and the movement is more frenetic than most series; this gives the show a western feel similar to that used in 'Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt'. As this seems to be one of the most talked about series of the moment and plenty of people are raving about it I'd definitely recommend checking it out even though I found it a bit too much at times.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I have to say, this anime was literally badass like i want to be Ryuuko's friend and have her badass cape (although i dont want a revealing suit and have a cape only power up for my blood lol). Seriously though I just love Ryuuko and her bad girl attitude, she's such a brillant fighter and can kick enemy's butt even well! Her scissor weapon was class too as well!The anime can be pretty over the top too and does have its hilarious moments. I just love how Ryuuko's friend Mako puts herself into dangerous situations and makes such daft remarks about things that make you laugh your head off wuth confusion lol! As annoying as she may look and act, she has a good heart I suppose lol!It's funny as well how there's so much nakedness on this and we don't actually get to see real genitalia which is kinda odd in a way. I'm not going to describe what you normally see in men and women's bodies as I don't want to get into deep do do with IMDB, but they are well hidden anyways! Moving on, I just thought this anime was very entertaining that it won't leave you bored and make you skip a couple of episodes (which I normally do to not waste time). I definately would recommend anyone to watch this although I would warn them if they don't want to see nakedness on this, to not watch it if they feel it'll make them uncomfortable. However I didn't really care, I just wanted to watch the action in this and it was not dissapointing!This anime deserves a 8/10 from moi! :D",
        "I loved it. The first two episodes were quite boring, but with each episode it revealed it's true colours. The humor is great, though it has way too much perverted jokes. The plot is becomes way more complex as it goes on. The characters are memorable. There are a lot of action and overall the whole series were very fast paced. If you want something heartwarming and mindless fun to pass time, this is definitely to watch.",
        "Ryouka Matoi joins Hanoji Academy to find the killer who murdered her father. This academy is ran by the Satsaki and her elite 4 who control the school and rank each student from no stars who have to live in the slumbs to 3 stars who live with benefits. Ryouka also meets this cute and hyper active girl Mako who is willing to help Ryouko make a living and her sidekick. She is also introduced to their teacher who in secret is agent to infiltrates Satsuki and her elite 4.\nThe series has a rather unique animation I must say with good visuals especially since the creator of Guren Lagann also made this series. I also do like a lot of the characters look in design.As far as going as plot the series is funny and story wise it did hold well. I don't really have any complaints though I can see why some people may be put off.As far as going as voice cast Erica Mendez was excellent as the tomboy badass fighter Ryoka, Christine Marie Cabanos was perfect as the adorable and hilarious Mako and the other voice actors including Matthew Mercer, Kaiji Tang, Carrie Karenen, Patrick Setiz, Laura Post, Christina Vee, Stephanie Sheh, Sarah Williams, Todd Haberkorn, Erika Harlacher, Steve Staley, Derek Stephen Prince, Grant George, Phillice Sampler, Michael Sorich and David Vincent all played their parts well.\nIf you enjoyed Gurren Lagaan you might enjoy this.",
        "In the same vein as Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill takes ridiculous extremes to make it as visually memorable a show as possible. Considering that this show actually carried over a lot of the same people who made Gurren Lagann it's no surprise that it's similarly enjoyable to its Mecha-cousin even if there's not all that many similarities in terms of story.To put simply in a short and sweet manner: great anime that's actually very appealing to animation aficionados in general.",
        "This show is so bizarre I can't even begin to describe it. Its about 90% action that is edited so spastically its a wonder it ends up being so easy to follow. The characters and story are all over the place, but manage to be consistent and interesting. While this is definitely not a show for everyone, I would highly recommend it.",
        "All over the place crazy stories ,interactions, fights.\nunique and strange most times.\ninteresting different types of cartoon styles.lot of thinking and imagination.-1 because way too much nudity and sex allusions regarding females but at the same time what make it what it is. definitely more for a male oriented viewer but hopefully some female viewer will enjoy the sometime a bit pervert style of this anime.\n.\nBest anime I have seen in a long time.",
        "The search for her father's killer leads the student Ryuuko, wielder of a scissor-shaped sword, to Honnouji Academy, which is under the merciless regime of Head Girl Satsuki. To learn the truth, she must confront elite students whose special school uniforms grant them supernatural powers. Ryuuko has no choice but to slip into such a uniform herself and unleash powers she never dared to dream of.\"Kill la Kill\" is a special anime that has\nmany wacky moments. The anime works in\nits own unique way.The characters don't have a lot of depth, but that's not what this is about at all.The Anime is meant to be entertaining and it does it well.Ryuko and Aikuro also complement each other well as a team and the animations look really impressive.I usually don't really like anime that involve a lot of fan service either, but this one is different.He somehow makes fun of it itself.The anime is perfect to switch off your head and just let yourself get entertained.",
        "I'm not going to go into any specifics because everything you need to know about it should be here.This is what I thought anime would be before I got into it. It oozes with style and smooth clean animation. It's very violent, gory, grotesque, disgusting, weird, while still remaining stylish and clean. It has a lot of lewd elements, with the very revealing clothing of characters. It's full of energy, with its pompous characters, which frankly I found to be more annoying than anything.This is just the most over the top Anime I've yet to watch, and to be honestly, I'm not a massive fan of it. I appreciate what it is, and it's somewhat enjoyable. I can praise its style, and while I usually like these fresh and stylish types of show, it just isn't my cup of tea.If you like what you see, then definitely give it a shot, but if this isn't your type of show, then I can't recommend it.",
        "'Kill la Kill' is a riveting revenge story with plenty of plot twists, action scenes, drama scenes and everything else to keep the viewer interested. Ryuko is a compelling character (hence the 'Princess Bride' reference in the review title), the visuals are stunning, although I have a problem with a particular sort of \"lampshading\" (commenting on sexualization of women and girls while also perpetuating it). Still, Japan is trying to fix that. Hopefully.",
        "\"Kill la Kill\" is filled with colorful visuals, brash music, insane characters, plot points that are almost nonsensical and is so packed with tropes it's almost unbelievable....\nThe insane characters make the plot that would typically be cringeworthy instead feel \"right\" especially when paired with well timed music and somehow it comes together beautifully to create a non-stop ride that is nearly perfect, hell even the mind boggling amount of \"Fan Service\" fits seamlessly and gets explained as part of the plot.\nBefore long the final boss is defeated, the credits are rolling and your left with a smile on your face, feeling satisfied which is a rarity among anime's..\nBest binged and an excellent \"palate cleanser\" after a more serious series it's a rare example of near perfection.\nPro's:\n-Unique and enjoyable animation.\n-Engaging music.\n-Colorful and enjoyable characters.\n-Closure.\n-Excellent English Dubbing.\nCon's:\n-Excessive \"Fan Service\" will turn off some.\n-Entire show is \"over the top\", realists should avoid.",
        "Well, if you can survive through first 8 episodes you will get some entertainment. Anime has some fun references and jokes and fighting scenes",
        "From the minds who brought you the absolute absurdity of Gurren Lagann comes Kill La Kill, a show where an extremely attractive, essentially naked teenager beats the crap out of people with half of a giant scissor with the help of a talking sailor uniform. Sounds freaking amazing! Is it? For the most part, yeah. I'd actually say this is much better than Gurren Lagann, as this show is more consistent in terms of quality. Not saying Gurren Lagann was bad, but it took me a while to get into. From episode one to episode twenty four of Kill La Kill (except episode 7), I found it awesome. The story is very unoriginal and kind of follows Gurren Lagann's plot structure now that I think about it, but that isn't the point of this show. It wants to slam you over the head with beautifully animated, epic fight scenes while doling out plenty of fan service. And it does that perfectly. I like all these characters. Ryuko Matoi, Satsuki Kiryuin, and the Elite Four are entertaining thanks to their awesomeness in battle,and Mako Mankanshoku and her family bring some truly hilarious comic relief to the table. It isn't without problems though. Episode seven is bad. I won't spoil it, but trust me, it's no good. That, and I didn't like one thing about the ending. Again, won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it. Those two very minor things are nowhere close enough for me to advise against watching this, however, so go watch it! You will not be disappointed.",
        "I start with saying that this series is held back by its frequent fan service and borderline nudity at almost every pre-battle scene. Also the show has a high amount of excessive dramatization (as do many anime). Beyond these two weaknesses the show is really great. The lore and world-building the show does is fantastic. The characters are amazing minus Mancanchoke (she is too much). The animation is takes a cool classic approach and turns out fine. The storyline, plot, twists, and villians are just great. The nude beach team or whatever could play a smaller role and i'd be happy. Please stop constantly showing middle school girls in miniscule clothing and this could be one of the greatest one season animes ever (though some already consider it one).",
        "The series is made of 2 part: in the first one Ryuko enter in the accademy aiming to revenge his father samurai style, in the second the war starts, violence level is greatly increased but the story get also more interesting.What is good? For sure the animation: Thanks Trigger.Another pro are Ryuko and Satsuki transformation (and yes sorry for proctors but there is a reason why they have to dress like that, it is clearly explained in the second part): however this send my memory back to 70's style mecha series where the best part was the super-mecha transformation scene, so.... maybe not a really a masterpiece... .But this is the only justified fan service, with regards to rest I think the target audience is not correct as the story is pretty straightforward / for young while many other parts like violence, level of some discussions, etc.. are not.The best character is Mako, unfortunately she is also the most affected by one of the negative sides of the series, the speech speed: Fine if you have dubbed but if you have to read subtitles it is annoying, especially for her who is the fastest speaker.Another negative is Aikuro: he act like a perv in the first part while in the second part whatever he says is obscured by his own fan service, he is the reason why I would not reccomend this series for minors (see first bad discussions with Ryuko).",
        "Kill La Kill is the worst anime ever made nothing makes sense and its crazy every 5 seconds. It's so low brow and disgusting. It just tries too hard to be weird. Weirdness is better when it comes naturally instead of trying to force it. If you want non senencial humor done right turn on Monty Python. Sex jokes and naked people. Ha ha so funny. There aren't really any punch lines they just put stuff on the screen and you are expected to accept it. Surrealism is good but they really over do it. I think stories that are surreal should be some what grounded this is just annoying.",
        "Visuals: 9\nOk, the visuals were great! The style is great, all of Triggers shows have really good styles and this show isn't an exception. The animation succeeds in two different; it's probably the most visually funny. For example, in one of the episodes Ryoku is in a hurry and needs to transform as fast as possible (think it was the episode where Satsuki challenges the students and if they would lose they need to quit the school). And by just speeding her transformation animation just a little, they make it look like she's in a hurry and funny. I don't even know if that was supposed to be a joke, but that's one of the many visual gags. They also manage to REALLY make it look like all the powerful are really happening. How the \"camera\" shakes, the air shots away and if something gets an impact you really feel it. Whenever there's a scene in the past, color palette changes and I really like that color palette. I also really liked that whenever a text would come up (for example when someone puts on their Goku suit and they show the name of the suit) sometimes they would interact with them, but not too much so that it becomes fourth wall breaking. Both OP's had good animation, but the first one was more interesting IMO. There were also small things that I really liked, but it wasn't perfect.My biggest con with the visuals was the sexuality. Some were fine, it was there and didn't distract me. But some were very weird. Ryokus and Satsukis transformations and suit, in general, were too sexual in my opinion. The buttons on Ryuukos suit even looked like nipples. The suits were just too ridiculous. And then there was Aikurou. I liked that he changed personality, but why did he randomly? It was very weird and distracting. I also didn't like the black bars on the sides when there was a flashback scene. I also didn't like how Ragyous hair was rainbow colored, there were some digital zooms that looked bad and sometimes they would repeat an action shot 5 times in a row which looked really weird.Oh, and the action was really good too.Music: 8\nI really like the music. Some were fine, but they were mostly good. The first OP had a fine soundtrack, but the second one was really good IMO. My favorites were Ambiguous (OP 2), KIRYUG@KILL and Ad la Lib.Plot/Script: 9\nThis was really good too. It was interesting, I really like Ryuukos relationship with Senketsu, Tsumugu's intent in the beginning isn't evil which makes him turning over to \"her side\" not feeling too weird, I like that the person wearing the suit can get too angry for the suit to handle (so it's good that it only happens once when Ryuuko meets her fathers killer the first time), I like that the academy was basically an experiment to see how humans could take the power life fibers, the plot twists were unpredictable (IMO), Ryuuko and Satsukis relationship in the end and Senketsus death was handled really well and emotional. But there were many small things I didn't like, like that they throw in Mako if anything bad happens to Ryuuko.Characters: 8\nThey were mostly really good. I really like that when Satsuki becomes friends with Ryuuko and her gang, her personality doesn't change too much. But Mako wasn't funny, mostly when she did those blue background comedy scenes. She even did those in the middle of an emotional scene, which just ruined it! Ragyou also feels like a character I have felt a hundred times, otherwise, I liked her.Overall: 9",
        "The writing and plot is really bad. It's stupid, Non sensical, inconsistent, yet at the same time it could be so fun to watch. I wouldn't recommend this anime to younger audience. If you have nothing better to do, yes go for it. It's a nice show to run in background while you do other stuff.",
        "In the land of terribly boring edgy 2 dimensional characters there's Dante from the Devil May Cry Remake (Edg) There's Shadow the Edgehog (Edge) and Ryuko (Edgy) from Kill La Kill and here we'll be talking about the latter. Now kill la kill looks a lot like Gurren Lagann that's because the writer and director both worked on Gurren Lagann another bad anime with a moronic plot and bland two-dimensional moronic characters that don't develop at all and remain bland two- dimensional moronic characters. So the story go like this; Ryuko's father apparently created the goku uniforms that give the wearer super human strength, speaking of Goku I'd much rather be watching Dragon Ball Z or Goku Midnight Eye both of which are much better anime. But back to Kill La Kill so Ryuko's father made the super suits that everyone uses in this anime but made another suit that no one knows about and of course it's black because it has to be edgy. Her father was also murdered because he didn't like how they were using them or whatever. So this edgy girl name Ryuku comes to the Honnouji Academy of Stupidity and Idiocy to avenge her father or whatever she also carries around a ridiculously big looking pair of garden sheers that's supposed a sword further cementing her as an edgy teen with daddy issues. So Ryuko fall down a shaft or something and finds the black edgy suit and it bonds with her but takes some her blood in the process then she goes up to challenge the evil school of uniform wearing morons. She fight her way to the top the school until she has to fight the school president Satsuki and they fight and fight but then surprise surprise she wasn't so bad after all and it turns out her mother was the real villain all along. So even though Ryuko and Satsuki have been rivals for the majority of the show they team up to beat the bigger bad guy.Like Gurren Lagann from here on stupid fights occur there's nonsensical action explosions and other michael bay esque garbage. Then the two protagonists one the former antagonist fight against the evil Principle they fly around everywhere there's fireworks stupid humor blah blah blah then they charge up they're super duper attack and the two edgy girls beat the principle/mother and save the day. But wait there's still graduation... So the secretary shows up in a giant robot and captures whatsherface the anti anti hero then she beats Ryuko who is about to fall to her death in the best moment in the entire show but is cut short by the edgy uniform which turns into an absurdly large pair of scissors to save Ryuko but not to cut a grand opening ribbon with but to beat the bad guy. She does obviously with a bunch of stupidly named attacks that appear in bold on the screen in Japanese and then everyone lives happily ever after except the people who just finished watching it. If you want to watch an anime about a dark brooding anti hero with a giant sword go watch the 1997 Berserk series or read the manga, if you want a story about a whiny edgy teen with a giant pair of scissors I guess you can watch kill la kill.",
        "I feel as though this series embraces the bombastic crazy fan-service that we expect with certain anime and satirizes it to the extent in which is becomes art.It also has a fun story and plot, that end up providing some pretty crazy moments. While there are deeper themes relating to family and such, it's just so fun of a series to me that I can't help but love it.",
        "This anime is what got me into Trigger. I have never seen another animation studio take such full utilization of a limited budget and provide people with an experience that you can truly call unique. From beginning to end, nonstop, this anime is loud, wacky, wild, eccentric, and just downright insane, laced top to bottom with over-the-top fanservice, genuinely creative animation, and a ridiculous premise... yet that is what I love so much about this anime. This is purely unhinged entertainment at its finest.",
        "Kill la Kill is a masterpiece that reiterates again the concept of genuity over perfection - when new student Ryuko Matoi shows up at Honnoji Academy, challenging the head Satsuki Kiryuinn, the whole school is out to get her. However, due to the fact that they believe in perfection and borrowed power rather than building themselves up and their own strength, they fail and Ryuko comes out on top. One of the most creative, fun and original anime I've seen in a while.",
        "Kill-La-Kill might be my favorite anime! It's over-the-top, hilarious, action-packed and has amazing animation. The characters are memorable and lovable. Ryuko and Mako's friendship is absolutely adorable and I love seeing them together!\nDefinitely a must-watch for anyone who loves something extremely over-the-top.",
        "It's a must watch and a great societal commentary.",
        "Being a fan of TTGL, this was a must watch for me. While it never quite reached the heights of TTGL, I can't hold it against Kill la Kill. It's a fan, action packed thrill ride that's a must see for any anime fan. It's pure unadulterated fun. The show is about a teenage girl who is looking for the murderer of her father and ends up at an academy run by a fascist student council. Students at the school, depending on their rank and club, have uniforms that grant them superhuman abilities. The the gist of it. The series has very likable characters and solid humor, though Mako can get slightly annoying at times. The animation is solid and the music is memorable. Overall the presentation is good. Some people are put off this series because of the fanservice, but trust me, it's not bad. I mean, it's not in your face, borderline erotica. It feels self aware and in on how skimpy everyone's (guys included) outfits can get. All in all, it's one of the best anime of 2013- 2014."

    "Attack on Titan": [
        "This is the biggest anime series to debut in 2013 in more ways than one! Set in a past where what is left of humanity is forced to live within three protective walls while giants known as Titans roam outside eating anybody they catch. Those inside the walls have grown complacent, taking their safety for granted\u0085 then one day a giant Titan appears and smashes the outer wall. The others flood in and start killing the fleeing people within.One who gets away is series protagonist Eren Yeager although he sees his mother being devoured and promises that one day he will kill all of the Titans. To that end he enrols in the military along with his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman and his best friend Armin Arlert. When they are about to graduate from their training class another giant Titan appears and it looks as though another wall is going to fall. In the ensuing battle many people are killed and shockingly Eren is eaten by a Titan! Something strange then happens; another giant Titan appears but instead of fighting humanity it starts killing other Titans\u0085 it turns out this giant is Eren! Somehow he has the power to transform into a Titan; some people think he could be used to save humanity but others think he is a danger that must be destroyed.It wasn't long into the season that it became apparent this was going to be the most high profile series of the year. No time was wasting in over-explaining what was going on and we were quickly thrown in to the brutal action. Given that this is a shonen rather than seinen series I was a little surprised at just how brutal it was. There are numerous bloody deaths right from the start which will probably earn it a 15 certificate when it gets its UK DVD release. The way we are thrown into the action got me gripped quickly and each week I looked forward to seeing how the story would develop. The action is animated in a way that gives the impression of constant movement, especially when the characters are swinging between buildings or trees with their steam powered 'maneuver gear'. This makes it exciting. The fairly large cast of characters are worth caring about which gives an emotional hit when ones are killed. If there is a flaw it is that Eren is rather annoying in many of the early episode; constantly angry but achieving little\u0085 thankfully his character matures somewhat once the real action starts. As the final episode approached it was clear that there would either be a rushed ending or another series\u0085 the conclusion pointed to the latter which should please the vast majority of fans; I know I'm looking forward to seeing more of this exciting series.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I recently completed watching season 4 of \"Attack on Titan\" (2013) after it was highly recommended by Finnigan Sommers. Finnigan sent me an \"Attack on Titan\" t-shirt for my birthday one year and insisted that I watch it, so my daughter and I did, and it's nothing short of amazing.The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where the last survivors reside within enormous walled cities to keep the man-eating Titans at bay, for the most part. However, these Titans keep breaching the walls and inching closer to the central city where the leaders of humanity reside. Questions arise: Why do the Titans exist? What role did the government play in their creation? Can anyone stop them?Created by Hajime Isayama, this series boasts a brilliant storyline with profound depth. The animation is intense, graphic, and perpetually instills a sense of fear and hopelessness in every scene and situation. Even when characters experience moments of happiness or believe they have a path forward, I couldn't help but think, \"Why, when we know how this will turn out.\" The Titans are portrayed as ruthless and well-crafted antagonists. The exploration of the Titans' origins is a smart and intricately developed subplot that keeps your mind racing with possibilities. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this series. My only minor complaint would be that some of the political subplots and character development can drag, but it's challenging to criticize \"too much talking\" while also acknowledging the series' remarkable depth.In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a unique and top-tier addition to the anime genre, an absolute must-see. Thank you, Finn, for the recommendation. I miss you, buddy. I would give this a 9.5/10 rating and strongly recommend it.",
        "Being someone who actually kind of liked the live action movies, it was simply impossible for me not to like the actual thing. One thing that Attack on Titan has it going for it is the whole mythology behind the main plot. There is a huge base of information layered down so that the actual story to flourish. Plus, the action scenes are enough to keep it interesting till the very ending. Another plus was the fact that some episodes could keep you at the edge of your seat, like when that female titan appeared. You just want to keep watching. To both of them, the soundtrack helped a lot, especially the opening theme, building up the mood for something epic. Finally, the characters were really likable and you couldn't help but sympathise with all of them. And now the negative points. Season one had some boring episodes, but fortunately, season two had just some boring parts here and there. However, season two had less episodes with the main characters, which was kind of annoying. You want to see Eren more than just a few seconds in an episode. But that's just me. Also, the art kind of didn't settle with me. Mikasa looked like the male characters, only with the addition of long hair. But, in the action scenes they did a great job, so at least that worked. Also, the titans got worse in season two, weirder in a way, but that could have been just a story thing. So, overall, 8 out of 10.",
        "I finally got to watch this properly and honestly, I effing love the theme song! I'm a lot more obsessed with this season's theme song then the other 2 seasons after it. I even love the characters as well, I think Levi,Eren, Mikasa and Hange are one of the best likeable characters in this anime that I've ever come across! Glad I got a chance to see this anime, 8/10 i give it!",
        "This series has a lot of well animated action sequences that grip you. The settings and characters feel very detailed and you never know how things will turn out. My only complaint is that it takes a while for the story to pick up.",
        "It's true - every great thing I've ever heard about the Japanese Anime' series \"Attack on Titan\" is true. A friend of mine recommended this series to me a while back, and I finally just got around to watching the first half of the first season on DVD. I can only hope it gets better from here.In the year 845 in the distant future (?), mankind is at war with the Titans, massive humanoid creatures of unknown origin, are of varying size and strength, and who appear to possess very little in the way of intelligence - yet share a ravenous appetite for human flesh. The remnants of human civilization have barricaded themselves behind massive walled cities as their only form of defense against the Titans, who attack at random and seemingly without any thought or purpose.At the beginning of the series, over a hundred years have passed without a major attack from the Titans. But that relative peace is shattered when one day a massive new breed of Titan called a \"Colossal\" smashes through the walls of the southern city of Shinganshina. In Shinganshina, we're introduced to three childhood friends - Eren Jaeger, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackermann, and their mutual friend Armin Arlert. During the attack, Eren witnesses his mother being devoured by one of the creatures.Two years later (and in using an important plot point bearing similarity to Robert A. Heinlein's \"Starship Troopers\"), the three then enlist in the military to help fight in the war against the Titans. By the time they graduate from the military academy in the year 850 and have joined the fight to save humanity, Mikasa proves to be the most physically skilled at killing Titans (who despite their apparent resistance to physical injury and tend to regenerate quickly from whatever wounds they do sustain in battle, do have one weak spot on the back of their neck). Armin is the weakest of the three, yet is later revealed to be an expert battlefield strategist and tactician. And lastly, there's the wild-card of Eren Jaeger, who is soon revealed to have a unique ability that may just help turn the tide of the war against the Titans in favor of humanity.\"Attack on Titan\" is adapted from the best-selling, critically acclaimed Japanese Manga series of the same name created by Hajime Isayama and published by Kodansha in Japan. This is one of the most gripping, thrilling, and harrowing Anime' series I've seen in a long while. Perhaps the most credit belongs to series director Tetsuro Araki, who was also behind the superior \"Death Note\" and \"Highschool of the Dead\" (the latter of which I never saw, but have already read the original Manga).\"Attack on Titan\" places many different elements into the mix, from horror, to dark fantasy, to the post-apocalyptic thriller, to the futuristic war film. \"Attack on Titan\" is also not an Anime' series for young children. The series is quite gruesome in its depiction of violence - against humans and Titans alike - and there's lots of blood. Yet in spite of what I just wrote, the series is admirably restrained in its depiction of the most graphic carnage - preferring to leave such things to the imagination of the viewer.Some have compared \"Attack on Titan\" as being Japan's equivalent to the American TV horror series \"The Walking Dead\" (which I also adore). I can honestly see some of the comparisons, since both \"Attack on Titan\" and \"The Walking Dead\" possess gripping characters and story-lines. Despite the vastly different subject matter, both series do ultimately depict a bleak future for humanity in the face of certain apocalyptic doom. Yet in spite of it all, in both series there is a faint glimmer of hope, and a case is made for humanity's continued survival (if not to continue to remain the dominant species left on Earth).I can say that \"Attack on Titan\" does have a new fan in this thoroughly impressed viewer. I can't wait to see the second half of season one.10/10P.S.: The opening theme song - \"Guren no Yumiya\" (literally translated from Japanese as \"Crimson Bow And Arrow\")/\"Feuerroter Pfeil Und Bogen\" (German spelling) - by Linked Horizon is one of the most thrilling opening songs I've ever heard in a Japanese Anime' series. Too bad it's not used throughout the whole series (my only serious gripe so far)...",
        "Review By Kamal KStory 10/10It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.Animation 10/10As we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10.\nAnimation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. . Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.Sound 10/10I mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.Characters 10/10What i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters.\nThis season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her \"Christa Lenz\" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a \"gambler\". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her \"I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl\". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).Enjoyment 10/10I never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.Overall 10/10",
        "This anime is seriously overrated. The action and animation are truly amazing, but the characters are one-dimensional and even annoying at times. Worth watching for the action, but is still pretty flawed.",
        "This show will forever earn a special place in my heart, as well for anyone who watched this show since 2013! This was an experience.. a journey.. an era that will be remembered for decades!First i want to makr it clear that you do not need to be familiar with anime to enjoy this show! I say that cause Attack on Titan was my first anime and therefore the introduction to the medium! I discovrred anime because of this and it ended up defining my life!This show might seem simple and straight forward at first, but as the show progresses it gets more complex with huge twist and turns you could have never predicted, that will leave you shockwaved, but still feels organic and natural! The writing and story is next level and having seen the ending, it felt like the endgame was decided from the beginning!The characters are amazing, especially Eren Yeager who turned into one of the most complex and well written characters in TV media history, along with the likes of Walter White from BB!Action qnd animation is AMAZING! Multiple sequences will leave you breathless! Delivers something you can only find in this show!The soundtrack is INSANE!! One of thr best soundtracks i have heard in an animated show, yeah in just any show! Its like Star Wars where the music blows up, even if not much is happening!If you have not watched this show.. DO IT!! This is not something we are gonna witness again for a LONG time! Its not just a show.. its something that will leave a deep impact in your memory forever!Thank you AOT for being such a huge part of my life!",
        "Ive been watching this show since 2016, and I wanted to write a review for it but I couldn't because with every new episode i have a mixed feelings and i can't determine where am i from this show. But now, with only 1 episode left, i can finally write whats in my heart.In AOT, you dont have to support the \"good\" against the \"evil\", because simply there's no such thing in this world. Usually, an any work whether if its a movie, tv show or an anime, there's sides and you as a viewer have the choice to support whatever you like good or bad. Most people choose the good side, some choose the bad one. This type of work represents almost 75% of all the works out there. So some of us have adjusted to the idea of good and bad sides.The other 25% are shows, movies and animes like AOT, they are psychologically complexed with a lot of twists and most importantly no good or bad sides. These kind of animes describes the world and our reality in such a scary truthful way, it mixes your emotions and feelings and you dont know what to think, makes you consider a thousand time before calling a character good or bad, this is AOT.After completing most of the show i can say, that AOT reached a high level of realism. That you dont have to determine in which side are you.One advice for anyone who hasn't saw AOT or is still in the beginning, dont take sides, just enjoy the anime because I believe its the best anime in the world.",
        "There's a lot of dialog that stops the action and the main character Eren is quite a little baby through most of it. Very overhyped show. Falls into a lot of the anime cliches that keep me away from most anime. Has its moments though.",
        "Excellent anime and the story is interesting. The animation and drawing in the anime are among the best. Most of the main characters were good, unlike the side characters such as Erwin Smith, who was the best character in the anime. The story branched out considerably after in the third season. I am very excited for the fourth season",
        "FOR SEASON 3 (10/10)The first half of the third season of \"Attack on Titan\" was a bit disappointing. Featuring politics and a lot of necessary backstory that mainly focused on Historia and the origins of Titans, it felt like a 12-episode story that could have been told with 6-8 episodes. However, what Part 1 lacked, Part 2 more than over compensated with its action packed episodes, a certain, depressing decision that Captain Levi had to make, and that emotional ending.",
        "Here's a Japanese show, that i thought I'd make an appreciation post for, called Attack on Titan. 8.8 on IMDb, 94% on Rotten Tomatoes, 8.4 on AnimeList 96% on Google Reviews and several other 5/5 and 4.9/5 ratings.---\nThe show is set in a different time in which, the citizens hide within a three-tiered, walled-off community that protects them from the Titans that live outside of it. There have been no Titan sightings in about a 100 years since the attack that nearly wiped out all of humanity, the threat still very much looms right outside their gates. And BOOM! All hell breaks loose. And trust me when i say this, but 'all hell breaks loose' is an understatement.---\nThis show is like Game of Thrones (the good seasons) x Band of Brothers x The Witcher x Assassin's Creed rolled into one show with some mindblowing music - hard rock and opera music. If you like serious storylines, brutal R-Rated war, and surprises (that I can't tell without spoiling this a little bit) you should TOTALLY watch this.This show is available in English and in Japanese. Season 01 is on Netflix and Tubi Tv. All three seasons are on Hulu. The entire show has < 60 episodes, about 20 mins each. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed.---\nUpdate: Bumping down a start for there this show is and has become in 2023.",
        "Attack on Titan, in case you haven't heard, is known for being extremely violent and over-the-top, and I like it that way. But Attack on Titan gets it spot-on. The show isn't really plot based, it's character and action driven. Sure, there is a plot, but it never goes much deeper than: \"Kill the titans and save the world!\" However, it still manages to be interesting and very exciting to watch. The characters are extremely well done. With the exception of some clich\u00e9 characters (all of whom manage to fit into the universe perfectly), they're all interesting to witness. Why? Despite the lack of casual conversation, every character feels real. This might be because every character has an original and unique design, making them feel real, or because they each manage to distinctly tell the audience who they are and what their like simply by stating a few sentences. When the actual fighting starts, you've barely met the cast and yet you've fallen in love with them. It's clear from the get-go that every character has bonded with the others, making the relationships feel a lot more real right off the bat too. The action is epic. The fights are, although not the most realistic or perhaps effective in terms of titan murder, very intense. But the action doesn't really feel overdone, in fact, it's actually quite realistic (and pretty tame if you ask me). Every character is expendable, and could die at any given moment. When they do die, it's brutal and will make you cry. I almost did every time, but I'm not an emotional person to begin with. Whether you know a character or not, you find you care about them because no one deserves as grisly a death as the ones received. Overall Attack on Titan really is a great show. It's fast-paced and realistic, despite being a fantasy. If you like blood and gore as much as I do, then look no further then Attack on Titan.",
        "In a world where giant humanoid titans roam the land killing all in their wake only a single massive walled country survives as a place of peace and prosperity. That is until a colossal titan finally breaks through the outermost wall, changing the course of history for what's left of humanity forever. Following Eren, a young boy and his family who experience the destruction on that first day the walls collapsed, and his growth as a military soldier and scout, learning how to fight these gigantic beings. I had started this series way back in college when it first aired, and like many at the time was fairly hooked. However after picking it back up a number of years later as new content finally was airing I could not help but be bored out of my mind. Setting it back down until this year when they announced the finale would at least be released, I restarted the series from episode one, just in time for this past weekend's conclusion. And just like before, I was hooked, the animation, world building, and story was great... at first. Until about half way through the first season, when I again remembered just how slow, melodramatic, and unrealistic so many points of this show were. And after this realization I was left with essentially three more seasons, each getting slower, less significant, and so much more boring than the last, for dozens of episodes. As the series progressed the animation quality continually declined (or at least its budget and what they were capable of did), and as the series was catching up to the manga / waiting for it itself to finish, the pace of the plot became a drag. Everything is so serious and dramatic, I think 90% of the dialogue turns into crying, yelling, or internal monologuing about death, violence, and purpose. The show certainly has a lot to say about power, war and their inevitable consequences, but honestly what that opinion is I'm at a loss. The well animated fight scenes are very cool, however are far and few between. They introduce so many characters over its run that by the end it continually referenced or showed previous characters and I had no clue who they were or why they were significant. Honestly towards the late middle the only thing keeping me going was reminding myself that it was finally ending this year. And so it did end, and I must say the quality of the true finale shot up significantly, that end was the best thing since the very first arc. I still have considerable gripes with the end, and I still think much of the world-building decisions / narrative conclusions are dumb, but it was good enough that I must admit on average was enjoyable, at least enough to watch nearly 100 episodes of it. Honestly very overrated as far as anime go, and wouldn't be the first thing I recommend, but I gather that some love it. I'm feeling a light to decent 6 on this thing, but that's just my opinion.",
        "Okay, if you want to see a series of the utmost strangeness this is it. A town or village is wrapped up like a cocoon behind a fifty meter wall made of strong cement and concrete. Outside of these walls are individuals who walk around naked one quarter of the height of these walls. What ever they are, they look humanoid, but with an appetite for human flesh. For the past 100 years, the walls have kept the village safe until one fateful day the secretive Titans as they are called appeared to break down the wall so that the walking demons could have their fill. And these titans are higher than the wall itself. Now a boy named Eren, vowed revenge against them for having his mother eaten by one of the demons in front of him while on the run with his friend Mikasa and Hanne. This horrible dream for which the people themselves feared had come true, a reality that not all walls can hold back an enemy no matter the size. Even water drops over a hundred years can break a wall. Now outside of the walls, Eren must become part of the military with very limited weapons to help their cause. But more often than not, the soldiers themselves cannot find out where or when these titans arrived to cause so much despair and terror. This series is not for the feint of heart, it contains a good amount of gore as well as horror scenes which will curl your hair. I have to say this is one for the books, I have seen all sorts of horror but this series looks very, very interesting. I would have to say anyone over eighteen can watch it. Under that age will give kids nightmares. One of the most original series to date. Highly recommended to those who like this genre.",
        "The first anime I ever watched was way back in 2019. I never really was intersted in anime at that time and I thought it was for weirdos and little kids for some reason ( I was an idiot back then don't make fun of me). But you know I decided to give a shot cuz everything deserves a first chance and so I decided to watch it going for low expectations. In less than 5 eps this anime completely changed me, I was in complete awe. It became my favorite anime of all time. And even after watching a bunch of new and old animes such as Fullmetal, Neon Genesis, and Cowboy Bepop , it still is my favorite! , first time is the charm for me I guess. Now I regret watching it as my first anime because you know why?! Cuz barely any other animes I have watched lived up to it's tremendous expectations!Its one of the most unique and consistent animes of all time. It has brilliant worldbuilding that is extensive and detailed. Such as giants that eat humans, humanity being inside 3 massive walls, the use of factions such as the Survey Corps and Military Police, and the soldiers use what is called a 3d manuever gear that to take down those giants. And this is just scratching the surface, there's so much more than meets the eyes. The atmosphere, the buildup, and the plotline were cleverly executed. And is surprisingly quiet funny without barely even trying at times. There are quiet alot of themes and meanings to this anime such as the strong preying on the weak, the world being a cruel place, and abandoning your humanity to acheive something greater. One of the best elements of this anime is it's unpredictability. Unexpected deaths, outcomes in a fight, shockers etc. Your mouth will be wide open and dragging across the floor for the next 24 hours. But with any show or movie nothing is perfect. It does have pacing inconsistencies and minor flaws mainly in season 1 with some flashbacks and monologuing. Season 3 Part 1 was a double edged sword. It provided us with a lot of human conflicts and and added some answers to our questions but lacked in any titan battles whatsoever. Nontheless even the worst season in AOT would be considered 99% times better than most seasons in other animes.The characters are absolutely amazing, I'm sure you will like them the instant you meet them. You got the 3 musketeers which consists of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Eren is this brash little kid who would charge into anything even if it meant his death, he isn't the hero in this story, he isn't a character that your suppose to like, but his development was absoloutely brilliant, Eren Season 1 and Eren Season 4 are two completely different people, the innocence of him gone forever. There's Mikasa, Eren's right hand girl since she is the only friend/family she has ever known other than Armin. She has quiet a tragic backstory and seems to have a flawless personality. Eren is Mikasa's life. Armin, he is the character that is the most poised. He is really smart and has a strong sense of innocence throughout the seasons. But he isn't perfect, he was always nervous and frightened in dangerous situations for most of the seasons. What I like about him is that he knows the rights and wrongs without any biases. His development is probably the most interesting out of the show other than Eren. Now here are a couple of the \"main\" supporting characters. Levi, humanity's strongest soldier, he's cunning, dangerous, and somehow funny without even trying, I know alot of AOT fans adore him. Now there's Hange and Sasha, they are both nutcases. Their funny personailities completely mirrors each other except for a few minor traits here and there. Now I can go on and on how great the characters are in AOT but it's better if you watch it.The visuals were pretty good. The character designs, the 9 titans, the use of mood effects of shadow, how the world looked such as the 3 main walls, the landscapes, the towns etc. And as time goes on how characters faces and bodies change. Though the CGI didn't exactly mesh in with the rest of the hand draw animation and lacking a tiny bit of clarity but certainly does get better for each season. Also the directing and camera work were perfect. The music was amazing. The vocals are absolute bonkers though they are barely used in season 3 and 4. The choir really helped with the atmosphere and the the use of the instruments were brilliant. The songs used were decent, just lacked a bit of energy. And the intros and outros for each season were legendary!Overall a very very enjoyable series. Even with all the obstacles that they had to overcome such as budget, limited time, and getting a studio to accept them. Its one of the best animes of all time, no doubt! Nothing in this anime is short of but excellent! Defintion of you have to see it to believe it! It will forever be in my heart. Unique, intense,and absolutely gorgeous! Everything I ever wanted in an anime..Memorable: YES Rewatchable: YES for the rest of my life..",
        "Season 4 is already halfway through, and I've found myself revisiting the previous seasons once again. It truly stands out as a masterpiece on all levels. I had to pause S1E06 just now to write this review because 9 minutes into that episode had me crying once more.I've been following AoT since 2013, eagerly awaiting each new episode and season. It's hard to believe the series is ending very soon. \"Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened,\" and all that...For a while, my top 3 ongoing shows were GoT, Vikings, and AoT. Sadly, GoT collapsed before the finish line, Vikings gradually lost quality after its fourth season, while Attack on Titan has remained strong and not only stayed brilliant but actually improved in many ways as the show progressed, which is incredibly rare.To this day, I still listen to the amazing soundtrack while doing other things, and each time I return to watching the show, it's hard to find anything negative about it. Some people may say that AoT is overrated, and I might have thought that at some points in the show as well, such as at various points in Season 2 and 3. However, when you see how it all connects together and makes overall sense in the grand scheme, some seemingly weaker aspects or things that appear nonsensical, overly contrived, or dramatized at the time make sense upon revisiting it, or at least that was my experience.In any case, I would give Attack on Titan a 10/10 simply because it is intensely watchable, engaging, inspiring, epic, thought-provoking, anti-war, spine-chilling, horrifying at times, emotional, and tear-inducing.If you enjoyed the early seasons of Game of Thrones, Vikings, Breaking Bad, Fullmetal Alchemist, and other similar shows, then Attack on Titan is definitely for you.Now, I must endure the agonizing anticipation for each new and final episode of the last season...P. S. - a good companion documentary to this is Dominion (2018)",
        "I've only seen the first season but it was my first EVER anime apart from stuff like Pokemon you know. The action and such was done incredibly well and there is character development for all the other characters that aren't the main character. However, it took so long for the second season to come out that by the time it did I wasn't even watching anime any more.",
        "Favorite Episode: Hero, Midnight Sun, Perfect Game, Senshi, etc...Favorite Chapter (not aired yet): From you 2000 years agoThis will go down in TV history. It's the greatest shonen anime I've seen. The soundtrack, story, animation, art style, and voice actors are all at a masterpiece level. Tons of callbacks, the logic is very tight. It's obvious this took 13 years of writing, the story was meticulously planned from the very first chapter. Aside from some overdramatization in Season 1, the flaws are negligible. After reading the manga I can easily say it's the most well-executed media I've ever consumed (As of Jan 2021).",
        "\"Attack on Titan\" didn't really convince me after the first season.Almost the entire season is used for world building and unfortunately that made it a bit boring at times.I also stopped after the first season because I didn't feel like it anymore, but at some point I forced myself to watch the second season.And I was actually surprised, things are finally starting to roll and from then on things are going well.There is no need to talk much about the animation because everyone can see that it is on a completely different level than usual anime.The story is good too, but sometimes a bit too complicated for me personally.I had to pause here unusually often and google things again so that I understood the connections.But if you are looking for a sophisticated action anime with breathtaking animation, \"Attack on Titan\" is the right place.",
        "I'll admit that I wasn't going to check this show out to begin with. I had been disillusioned with Anime for a good period of time since the early 2010s; I didn't have anything against it but for a while it was all starting to seem the same to me. I guess years of being into Anime can do that to you plus the massive amount of shows you check out. So even the cool costumes I was seeing at conventions weren't enough to persuade me to check the show out, and even the sparkly text and histrionics about this supposedly being the \"Game of Thrones\" of anime could. But a week ago or so, my resistance finally reached a breaking point and I found myself on Netflix scrolling for twenty minutes straight looking for something to watch. After several minutes straight of trying to resist its pretty looking poster, I gave up and began watching it. And to my surprise, my low expectations were immediately exceeded with its gripping opening scene and I had gotten up to 8 episodes that night before heading to bed, finishing the show two days later I'll get the bad things about this show out of the way first, because there are quite a few of them: For one, the pacing is incredibly slow. I realize this isn't anything new in anime and DBZ had been the king of slow pacing, and thankfully it isn't a bother most of the time, but there are moments when its anime-ness begin to shine through- extended imagine spots and entire conversations did get rather frustrating. There are a few episodes that do rely on the characters not knowing what's on the outside of the wall, to the point where it causes the characters to act stupid at times. But then there is also the subplot where Eren becomes a Titan after being swallowed by one, and with a simple gnaw on his hand, can become a titan at will. There are a few situations that could be solved by him becoming a Titan, but he doesn't. In some situations it's effect but in others it's frustrating. And lastly the ending is a bit of a cop-out. I know it had to happen but even still it was somewhat unsatisfying But like any patient viewer I didn't let these spoil the show and just sat back and appreciated it for what it was: a stunning piece of storytelling and visual mastery. For all its flaws, there were enough high points to dull them; be it some rather unexpected twists in the stories or even just the few moments where you can just sit and appreciate the visual beauty. In addition, the action scenes are truly fantastic and well done; it's been ages since there have been action sequences this exciting in anime. It's always a joy watching the gas tanks shoot steam and watching the characters fly at full force of one of the titans to attack it. And the characters; the first time I've felt any attachment of any kind to the characters. Part of them is that none of them are written to be perfect and all have their flaws; there's a sense of moral ambiguity in each and every piece of character development. It was always interesting watching Eren try to balance out the power of being able to become a titan at will and the responsibility that should be exercised; for a major plot point spent on a female titan, he is faced with the choice of becoming a titan killing the other titan, or letting his friends fight. Of course, he realizes the hard way that both decisions have consequences- it's the moments like this that make Attack on Titan a wholly satisfying experience Attack on Titan is flawed no doubt, but bear with it- watching it is a truly rewarding experience. Sure, go for the badass costumes and epic action sequences, but stay for the grand scale storytelling and the visual brilliance. Even despite the flaws, it's clear that Attack On Titan's creators have poured nothing but love into it. It's fun to watch and is very interesting, but it also has parallels to Japanese war history and even throws some unexpected curveballs as a nice bonus. While I'm not sure my enjoyment is enough to have gotten me back into anime as a whole (though that \"Knights of Sidonia\" show does look awesome), I can say that you can count me as a supporter and a fan and while it is a shame we have to wait for a year to see the next season, I'm excited to see where this show goes next",
        "I am not the regular anime fan, I've seen some really good ones but Attack on Titan sits on a whole other level of amazing writing.The way the story unfolds is so well written and engaging, that I was hooked since the first season where the plot seemed to be a very basic revenge story between humans stuck living inside mysterious walls and their nemesis, humanoid titans which seems to exist with the sole purpose of eating humans alive.It's hard to make a detailed review without giving up on spoilers, I've shared the premises, but Attack on Titan is so much more than that... From the parallelisms with the real world depicting themes like war, greed, complacency, the inherit curiosity for exploration all the way to the grey characters and their respective development, I can only say good things about this anime.Ambiguity is an ever present concept in our lives, and this show depicts it like very few do, this associated with how brilliant the characters evolve throughout all 4 seasons its remarkable, you can empathize with someone that made the most awful things and that shows how brilliant the creator is.Adding to all the above, you will be facing many mind blowing twists and unexpected dark turns on the story, with one of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, specially the most recent episodes - considering this started almost 10 years ago!Outstanding soundtrack, I get the chills on many of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, nerve wracking and make you so hyped with all of the elements of the action combined, really a one of a kind TV show.I am eagerly waiting for the final part next year I don't know if it wraps up badly but up until this point it's a flawless masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.EDIT AFTER SERIES FINALE:\nIt's quite the challenge to say the least to end a series like this one, after having watched the final episode I can safely reinforce how much of a masterpiece this anime is.... The message in the end transcends entertainment, it's a timeless lesson and it is scary how close to reality it is. It's almost impossible to get into detail without writing a full script so I'll leave it at this; this is one of the best TV shows ever created, don't take my word for it go binge it now that it wrapped up!",
        "The show conveys every emotion well, making it easy for fans to get attached to the characters. With death around every corner, you can hear the fear and sadness the characters feel.Even awkward situations - like the embarrassment of telling your crush how you feel - are well captured in the show. You can't help but sympathize with the characters because they seem so human. Paired with the high level of character development, you truly build a strong bond with your favorite characters.Overall, there is very little to complain about the show other than the fact it is ending. It is worth all the sleepless nights and elevated stress levels incurred with every episode. Even if you are not a fan of action-packed shows, you will still appreciate the drama and suspense built into every episode. The only people I would not recommend it to are squeamish people or anyone that has a big test they need to study for."

    "Bleach": [
        "Bleach is one of my favourite anime series. I adored the characters, the setting, the swordfights and the whole storyline. There is a lot to get invested in. The action is brutal and menacing, the characters are distinctive and the storyline is gripping with a lot of suspense and surprises.",
        "I really can not watch anime. Everyone around me likes them, and I really wanted to give them a chance, but it bores me to death. My dear was watching the whole series two times and was ready to watch it again just to hook me, but watching Bleach is an agony for me. The subjective impression after the first few episodes is about 3/10, but I am aware that this is unrealistic and more a consequence of my taste than the quality of the series. The series has good characterization and a very interesting story, and I'm really interested in how it evolves, but the animation is poor, and the directing is horrible. The fight scenes are virtually unwatchable. Instead of raising the level of adrenaline, I was struggling not to fall asleep. Watching TV should be a pleasure, not a maltreatment, and therefore I give up and leave it unrated. (Rating on IMDb is there just for series to appear in my list of watched titles.)",
        "I watched this series with my daughter when she was a young girl, and it was a lot of fun. Some of the story arcs lasted too long in my opinion, but like every TV series that has a long run, there is a point when the creators and writers run out of new ideas. At least that is what I notice with most long TV shows, like Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Law & Order, etc. At some point you are seeing stories that are similar to something from previous years.I watched all the way into the 300 episodes, but I could not get English translations all the way to the end. I was about one season short. I really enjoyed the stories for the most part.",
        "The lords of death or shinigami are at the center of this anime in which you fight each other armed with katana, more or less, for an objective that changes from season to season. The plot is not exactly at the center of the story, indeed it is irrelevant. Everything is centered around the scenography fights and even the protagonist takes a back seat if that means showing another fight. It doesn't have a lot of plot but it is understood that this genre of cartoons are seen for fights and for nothing else.As a series it is good even if the graphic style is a bit crude. I would have preferred better graphics but it's still a good anime. There has been a progressive worsening as the series progressed but nothing exaggerated. The series was so successful that it generated 4 movies.",
        "Bleach by Tite Kubo is one of those manga that everyone's heard of. It holds a lot of value as a series because of it's fame and infamy, but also because it is a good example of what to do as well as what not to do for a long running battle shonen series. It really is one of the most conflicting manga out there.Bleach starts out strong by introducing Ichigo, a high schooler who can see ghosts. One night he is attacked by a Hollow, a malicious type of ghost. He is saved by a soul reaper (or shinigami going by the fan translations) named Rukia who is then injured. She has to give her powers to Ichigo in order for him to defeat the Hollow, and has Ichigo perform the duties of a soul reaper while her powers are returning.Initially the story is a fun Hollow of the week type of story with some school comedy mixed in. The stories introduce and flesh out a fun characters. This doesn't last long (compared to the rest of the story) and eventually things change to more complex conflicts (that can't really be delved into without going into spoilers) with more characters, more fights, and more nonsense.The story has some odd contradictions in it as things get more fleshed out and there are quite a few retcons and deus ex machinas. It's a shame because the story is very compelling and complex, the later parts just make less and less sense. Most of the story is also taken up with one on one battles that on a technical level all play out the same. Every character hides a powerup until the last possible moment and then wins. On a thematic and character level the fights are different enough, and they are drawn differently enough to mostly excuse how many there are. There also is a lot more sexual fanservice later on that gets in the way occasionally. It's not ever too bad though, since more often than not, the panels don't focus on it.Finally, the ending of Bleach is just bad. Everything ends with a rushed, anticlimactic final battle and a ton of unanswered questions. The ending was rushed as well, and showed a lot of stuff that didn't matter.The characters don't fare a whole lot better. The main character, Ichigo is one of the biggest Gary Stew characters out there. He gains pretty much every type of power imaginable and never has any trouble mastering them. He has the standard qualities of most shonen protagonists, rushing into battle and wanting to protect his friends, but he doesn't really have a goal for himself. He does feel a bit more mature than most protagonists, and does develop subtly, but he is overall not that great of a protagonist.Rukia is probably the best character in the series since she has a unique personality (teasing but also serious), and goes through a lot of character development. She is constantly rewarded within the story for her development as well, making her character very satisfying. The final character to go in depth on is Orihime, Ichigo's friend. She is useless. She has a decent enough personality (aloof and naive), but never does anything substantial in the story and doesn't have any completed character arc.Bleach has an enormous cast of characters, and the three previously mentioned are the only major ones introduced in the beginning, so no more will be talked about in depth to avoid spoilers. The rest can be talked about pretty easily together. Characters have strong personalities and flaws, but few get the spotlight and development they deserve. As more and more characters are introduced every arc, they get more silly (which doesn't fit the with the tone initially established) and one note, and more useless to the overall story. There are always exceptions to this general rule, but for the most part the characters in this series are all very likable, but don't have enough focus. Fake character deaths are also more frequent as the series goes on, which reduces the impact of many scenes.The character designs, however are very great. As the series goes on, the designs get more silly and weaker overall. There are so many good character designs though, that the few bad ones later on don't affect this area too much. Every design feels unique and well though out. They are very striking and immediately give a sense of what the character is like. Most designs are memorable as well. The good designs (which are most of them) are some of the best character designs out there. Overall, the characters look sleek, cool, and powerful, all fitting traits for the type of series Bleach is.When a series is published for 15 years, the art is of course going to go through some changes. Initially the art had a lot unique flair to it, with a lot of passion behind it, but it had lower detail and more inconsistencies. Later parts of the series feel less unique, and more white space is used for backgrounds (sometimes for good effect, sometimes because Kubo was lazy), but the detail goes up. The art in Bleach never goes bad, and there is always a lot of style in it, but it does change, which will always spark debates. Both art styles are strong in their own right, and both feel right for the part of the series they are in though.The flow and paneling does change as well, though not as significantly. The action is almost always communicated well, and panels flow well into each other. No matter what, it's easy to feel the motion in the pages, and the path of each page is well designed for easy reading. Just glancing through a few pages shows how great this aspect is. As the series goes on, moments are dragged out more with larger panels and more empty space.This trend hurts the backgrounds which were initially detailed enough to give the setting a lot of weight. In the second major arc of the series, the setting is meant to be empty and lifeless, so they style actually helps there, but after that, there is a lot of white space backgrounds. Most of the time, the panels are either too full, or a moment is being emphasized so the settings are not nearly as defined later on, even though they were supposed to be more interesting than previous settings.This trend follows in the writing of the setting as well. There are a lot of retcons and deus ex machinas that make the setting feel random and disjointed. Things contradict each other and rather than feeling like a real world with its own rules, the setting of Bleach (which is an expanded version of the real world with an afterlife) feels more like a random pile of stuff rather than anything that could actually exist. This applies to the character's backgrounds as well, since they don't line up in the timeline well.Rukia should have been able to defeat the Hollow in the very beginning of the story (this maybe could've been Aizen, but it was never explicitly stated). Yachiru (the one with pink hair), Yoruichi, Ginjo, and the Soul King were never fully explored (they are mentioned specifically because there were all aspects about their character that were never explained, rather than just unfulfilled like many others). While not showing a character's power is not usually something to complain about, this is a battle shonen, so it is very disappointing to not see Ichigo's final Bankai.The final two arcs make very little sense. The Lost agent arc was just a big retcon to get Ichigo his powers back, and the Thousand Year Blood War introduced a ton of Quincies even though they were supposed to all be dead. The final getsuga tenshou and the silver arrow were both massive deus ex machinas that hurt the plot more than they helped. Finally, Yhwach and Aizen have very vague motivations, particularly Yhwach.Bleach is a very conflicting series since there is a lot of good to be found here. The first arc is very good, the second is decent overall, the third is terrible, and the fourth is bad. Overall, if you are a big fan of battle shonen, then give Bleach a try. There are a lot of cool battles and characters to be found here. Otherwise, stay away from this series.",
        "Despite not personally topping the likes of Naruto and One Piece, Bleach truly was something unique with a more mature take in story than its perhaps more appealing counterparts (particularly in the west) the style and tone of the story is obvious and set from the first scene in the anime. With such a defined look and a handful of truly compelling arcs the show is a fantastic watch",
        "Bleach is one of those shows that really redefines fast paced action. The action is not real fast in the first episodes, but once you get through the series, the battles become intense and very epic. If a section of a city is not blown up, then it is a small battle. The show is good because it has a very large cast of characters, all of which are pretty good. I might say a lot of the characters are a little bit 2-Dimensional or there are some reoccurring character types. Some of them become a little clich\u00e9, but overall the characters are nice. The story follows a teenager who can see dead people. He meets a soul reaper who kills monsters called hollows which eat souls. A soul reaper protects those souls and lets them carry on to the next life. When Ichigo meets the soul reaper, the soul reaper is wounded in a battle, and lends Ichigo her powers. This is where the show starts. It eventually evolves into a very large series, where there is an entire soul society which has twelve very powerful captains, and an over ruling commander of the society. The interesting thing about the soul society is that it is far from perfect. There is a lot of corruption, there is a lot of problems. But the captains are overall good, and when something wrong happens they usually know what to do.The cast is very interesting as Ichigo is a cool character who is very very powerful, but he isn't arrogant. He isn't selfish. And he is kind of tired and bored. He is a good hero and isn't too generic. Once the show makes it to the hollow world, that is where everything becomes insanely intense. What was once thought to be a powerful foe earlier in the series turns out to be like ants once they reach the hollow world. The interesting thing about the Arrancar (Hollows with shinigami powers) is that they aren't a 100% evil either. Some of them are evil, but some of them are just bored, or just kind of following commands because they have nothing better to do. Very intense battles none the less.The only down side of this show, is that there is some repetition. Ichigo gains some powers, he goes and fights some badies, he learns some new powers, then goes fight more badies. But what makes the battles interesting is when you see battles between captains. This is where the show shows that the soul society doesn't work quite well. And the battles with captains against Arrancar are truly amazing.A small down side are the side arcs, or side stories. These aren't part of the manga (comics) and that means they are irrelevant. Personally these side arcs are much better than Naruto's side arcs which are just horrible. Overall a very good anime and I like it much more than Naruto.",
        "Its pretentious, childish and lacks internal logic, the whole series is 70% filler. The magic system and power levels are often negated by plot, like how the main character, more than often suddenly gains enough power to defeat the bad guy simply because the arc is about to conclude, basically he is weaker than everybody and stronger than everybody at the same time.Most of the characters are annoying especially after the soul society arc...This show is nowhere near the level of Naruto Shippuden and Dragon ball Z it miserably pales in comparison.The positive is that it has interesting world building, the fights are visually entertaining, I like the sword stuff but other than that its a senseless total waste of time and emotionally taxing...",
        "OK then. So, um, Bleach. Were do I begin with this show. So the story is about Ichigo Kuraski who apart from being able to see ghosts, he is just an ordinary high school boy, until a ghost threatens his family and a soul reaper called Ryuika gives him the power to be a soul reaper. Now the plot were I stand does seem OK, but the characters just seem to be typical shoenin jump characters. I just feels like Naruto with swards with nothing different or interesting about it. Another reason why I don't like the show is that even without fillers, the story just drags on and on, never really going anywhere, but I guess that's to be expected from Shonen Jump. None of the characters really appeal to me, as these type of characters are very common in most anime. I don't know, after the second arc of the show the third and fourth one's are just re-hashes of the second arc, just a different character who is in need of rescuing. I stopped the show after a certain fight, as I knew that this show wasn't worth watching. I think because I wanted o watch this show for the plot twists, but even the twists were'nt all that great. However, there were certain twists that I didn't expect that were cool, but that's about it. Overall, I think it's an OK show, but possibly not the best.",
        "This has to be one of the most generic, copy paste pathetic attempts to make money I have ever seen in the world of anime. It is absolutely atrocious in every way. The entire show feels like something taken from a \"how to for dummies\" book (actually I like those books but not for professional work). Ichigo is by far, one of the least likable characters in all of anime and I have been watching since the 80s. He is a complete imbecile, feels entitled to something he received by sheer chance, and behaves like one of those rich privileged rich kids who think they actually \"earned\" the right to be snobby. Rukia and the others are equally asinine and their stories are all over the place. There are no intellectuals in this show and on top of that, it is not funny in any way. I really do not know what people see in this show. At one point I thought that maybe I need to watch the dubbed version since many people claim its funny... it was much worse with the voice overs.I really don't understand how this thing gets a rating of over 3/10 or 4/10 unless someone is gaming the review sites or buying reviews. Mind you I watch some long running stuff like One Piece and such and heck, I even made it to about episode 50 in Naruto but this one is horrible. I made it through season 1 and it was like eating moldy gruel. Skip it.",

        "This is my review from mangaupdates and i stopped reading the manga somewhere aroud Vol.50. The anime is identical with at least 1/3 of it devoted to filler:I stumbled upon the anime many moons ago when it was new and i was an older teen. I liked it just fine but switched to the manga later to save time as episodes became too drawn out even without the filler. I then quit the manga just before Vol. 50 entirely and started to hate it now. I am currently 24 and still deem the first two arcs (till Soul Society ended) as decent in retrospect but the word \"empty\" describes them best. Good art (but never backgrounds), fine choreography and decent ideas were commence but any from of substance was lacking. To quote user strixflash \"Bleach was never a plot driven manga\" and that was true even then but the narrative utterly stopped when arc 3 began and the unending action scenes turned into the following: Two \"awesome\" underwear models with mullets of power meet, begin to stand in the air and beat each other up with super moves for no reason till someone wins or they agree to become friends. No one ever dies but the word death / i'll kill you are the most dominant sentences in the entire manga. The female characters are big breasted moral support only too but i will note that their sexualisation isn't as dumb as in most such series. I thus quit the manga after that arc was finally over and never looked back. The series apparently still sucks (500+ chapters and a dead spin-off are the stats now) and it finally started to loose both fans and an anime (!) but i am out for good. As many problems i have with One Piece and Naruto now i still have fun with them so go for the rest of the Jump trinity instead. Claymore (8,5/10), Hunter x Hunter (9/10) or Rurouni Kenshin (10/10) are lastly how modern shounen battle manga need to look like. Don't even get me started how much better the action (or everything else) is in the adult targeted Berserk, Kamui Gaiden or Until Death Do Us Part is but these were done by masters. The only thing of note about Kubo Tite is his glamorous hair and that he created the memetastic Aizen while the \"prequel\" Zombie Powder is even less interesting than Bleach. I wonder if he will even start a third series as the final arc of Bleach was apparently changed back to not being a finale... Money never sleeps. Even among the dead!",
        "I think that this is a bit of a cult movie for young people who are into anime/manga stuff. The fighting at the end where he keeps coming back to life is just too much for my brain to comprehend and I have watched some strange fantasy movies. Sorry but I just wasn't working it out.",
        "\"Bleach\" (Burichi) is a 366-episode long-running Action/Shounen/Anime based on the manga by Tite Kubo. This series is produced by Studio Pierrot, just like the on-going \"Naruto\"-franchise is.Basic about the beginning: The series starts off with the main character Ichigo Kurosaki, a high school student who is able to see spirits of dead people. One day he even encounter a Shinigami (Death God) named Rukia Kuchiki, who's purpose is to destroy evil spirits called Hollows, and send good spirits into an afterlife place called Soul Society. Injured after a battle with a Hollow, Rukia gives her power to Ichigo, who happens to be a substitute shinigami. It is after Rukia gets taken back to Soul Society in order to get a punishment, the real adventure really begins...Basic about the content: Like the still on-going anime series \"Naruto Shippuden\", this series has lots of long battle sequences to keep the audience entertained. Lots of humor are also included throughout the series, several of them involve either the mod soul teddy named Kon, or it's any scenes with Squad 10's captain Hitsugaya Toushirou who always gets annoyed by anything his big-breasted blonde vice-captain Rangiku Matsumoto does... The animation itself is great too.With a lot of characters to remember the names to in this series, you might also get to have sympathy for many of these characters.The only main problem with this series is a bunch of filler-episodes which (in my opinion) are just plain unnecessary. I mean, some of them are funny thou, while many other are just pathetic, making me want to shout out \"get on with the real story already\" loudly. This problem is also in the \"Naruto\"-franchise.Overall this series is very entertaining, you may even get hooked to this series. My big sister originally found this series, and even got me to watch this with her, same with \"Naruto\". The series generally also got two OVAs and four movies, the latter ones distributed in Japan by the great Toho Company. So if you haven't seen this series yet, then I can eventually recommend you to watch this at least once, preferably the Japanese language version which was the version my sister and I saw.Sadly, this series doesn't exist in Norway at all. Based on the Norwegian rating system, I would have given this an 11 or a 15 rating, most likely the latter one.",
        "Title: A Mixed Bag: Bleach Offers Excitement, but Falls Short in ExecutionReview:\nBleach, the popular manga and anime series, presents a mixed bag of qualities that make it both entertaining and frustrating. While it possesses moments of excitement, intriguing characters, and a unique world, it falls short in several areas, preventing it from reaching its full potential. With a rating of 6/10, Bleach is a series that may captivate some viewers but may leave others feeling underwhelmed.One of Bleach's strengths lies in its premise and world-building. The concept of Soul Reapers, Hollows, and the afterlife is intriguing, presenting a distinct and imaginative setting. The idea of characters wielding unique Zanpakuto swords and their supernatural abilities adds an element of excitement to the series. Additionally, the blend of supernatural elements with action and adventure creates a compelling foundation for the narrative.However, Bleach's execution often stumbles. The pacing can be uneven, with moments of slow development and excessive filler arcs that disrupt the main plot. This leads to stretches of episodes or chapters that feel disconnected or lacking in substance, causing viewers to lose interest. Additionally, the series has a tendency to introduce numerous characters without fully exploring their backgrounds or motivations, resulting in a lack of depth and emotional investment.Another drawback of Bleach is its inconsistent character development. While the main protagonist, Ichigo Kurosaki, undergoes some growth throughout the series, many supporting characters receive limited attention or development. This leaves viewers craving more insight into their personalities, backstories, and motivations. The potential for compelling character arcs is present, but the series often fails to deliver on this promise, leading to missed opportunities for emotional resonance.The action sequences in Bleach can be exhilarating and visually impressive. The use of unique powers, flashy sword fights, and the concept of Bankai contribute to the excitement. However, the battles often suffer from prolonged stretches of dialogue or repetitive patterns, causing the pacing to falter. Furthermore, the resolution of conflicts can sometimes feel predictable or lacking in tension, diminishing the impact of these climactic moments.The animation quality in Bleach is generally satisfactory but can be inconsistent at times. While the art style captures the essence of Tite Kubo's original illustrations, there are instances where the animation quality dips, resulting in awkward or poorly executed sequences. This inconsistency can be distracting and takes away from the overall viewing experience.Despite its flaws, Bleach still manages to entertain with its unique concept, action-packed sequences, and occasional moments of brilliance. For fans of supernatural shonen anime with a focus on action, it may offer an enjoyable experience. However, for those seeking a consistently well-paced narrative with deep character development, Bleach may leave them wanting more.In conclusion, Bleach earns a 6/10 rating due to its captivating premise, exciting action, and imaginative world-building. However, its execution, pacing issues, inconsistent character development, and occasional animation flaws prevent it from reaching the heights it could have achieved. While it may still find an audience among fans of the genre, it falls short of being a truly exceptional series.",
        "This anime is very amazing, sometime it was too childish but when it was about the story of Aizen it was amazing. The main storyline of this anime is very excellent. This has to be the best swords fighting anime ever.",
        "Watching this anime could be called a great experience. It has a setting of Soul society with majority of the characters being Shinigami. The universe isn't as big or as wide as Naruto's or One Piece's but despite that Tite Kubo managed to pull off an amazing and a long storyline. Like Naruto, majority of the Bleach's arc are connected to each other. So, despite being long, the storyline isn't a mess. In fact, with each twists and each revelations, it only becomes more interesting. The action is mostly about the sword fighting and almost each of the characters have some unique supernatural skills(in the form of Zanpakuto and Bankai) making the sword fight look more intense. There are also some characters, who fight with arrows.Bleach has amazing characters too. Initially, it looks like the characters don't really have any deep motives but as the series progress, we eventually realise that not all the characters are following duties. In fact, each of them have been set up and are now trapped. Some characters were literally playing dirty tricks with each other and deceiving everyone all the time. The character which really stands out is the primary villain Sosuke Aizen. I was so overwhelmed with his characterization. There were many smart Shinigami in the Soul society but almost each time, he manages to deceive them all. He is one of the most cunning or the most intelligent villains I have ever seen. Along with the characters, even we as viewers would initially believe his kindness. Even those who didn't trust him, couldn't stop him from using their own mistrust against them. He never lose his calm demeanor and it gets painful to see almost all the characters struggling against him in the battle. Only after achieving his apparent goal, he lets his overconfidence get better of him leading to his eventual defeat. That's when we got to see his real desperate personality as he discards his calm nature and is actually full of rage.Even the main character Ichigo is not an usual Shounen protagonist. He is more normal and more human-like. However, just like any other Shounen protagonist, he too has an access to some plot armour and sudden power-ups. It was bit annoying that Ichigo continued to become powerful and his apparent rivals started relying on him. Most of the Bleach character manages to leave some impact. Even the subordinates(Espada and other Arrancars) of Sosuke Aizen for a brief period are shown as major threats.Bleach has a good animation but the soundtrack is even more impressive. You can't get enough of the OSTs and some of its opening and ending songs.However, the last few arcs, as per the Bleach's standard weren't impressive. Post Fake Karakura Town arc, the only thing that saved this anime/manga was its reputation. At times, they would even feel unnecessary. Soon, the gap between Bleach and One Piece-Naruto was clearly visible in terms of quality.I am rating it as 7. However, till Fake Karakura town arc, I would rate it even higher.",
        "I liked Bleach at first. The first section where Ichigo (the main character) receives his powers and learns the basics of being a Soul Reaper to guide souls to the afterlife was pretty interesting, Ichigo being this sort of lost soul who can't seem to connect to people after some undisclosed tragedy that happened in his past.The second arc where Ichigo and his friends have to go rescue Rukia (the Soul Reaper that gave Ichigo his powers) from execution was also pretty engaging, introducing us to the Soul Reaper captains and the militaristic Soul Society as well as revealing the main villain.Then the series started to spiral downward. It took a while, but eventually the pacing of the episodes slowed enough to the point that not even to cool action scenes were engaging, as they were falling into the shonen trap of having characters perform a 13-second special move and then spend the next five minutes explaining EVERY SINGLE DETAIL about said move.But the crowning moment of lameness came at what should've been the series' most exciting episode. Ichigo is finally ready to confront the big villain who's been causing all the woe and death up to this point; the villain who they've spent episode after episode building up as this invincible god-like entity who is so powerful that you can die just by getting too close to him; the villain who can tame an entire realm. Ichigo has also grown pretty strong, though we haven't exactly seen go through these changes as most of them take place off screen. And when the two meet, do we get a huge explosive finale to the plot that has taken over 300 episodes to conclude? NOPE! Instead we get an two-episode long flashback followed by the exchange of all of THREE attacks (I'm not exaggerating, that is LITERALLY how many blows are exchanged) before the god-like villain who in no way can be defeated is defeated by a deus ex machina.I have no clue as to what happens next, as this was the point at which I checked out of Bleach. It started off well enough, but the amount of padding combined with the tired shonen tropes that plague long-running anime of today took its toll on me. Ichigo went from being a tortured soul to an emo kid with a connection to his friends that honestly felt kind of fake seeing as he only seems to care about them when they're in danger.And there's a pointless love subplot that goes nowhere. Seriously, the anime finished in Japan and the girl with the obvious crush on Ichigo remained in the friendzone. LAAAAAAME!",
        "I never understood the hype of the show until now. I saw a minute or two of an episode years ago on Toonami, but I did not know it was Bleach at the time because I caught it in the middle. I had no clue what was going on. I do remember a guy dressed in black robes and orange colored hair, which I know now is Ichigo; a guy or girl wearing all white, and a guy in a striped hat. I lost interest by not knowing what was happening.Now that I am watching it from ep 1, the ep I saw makes sense because I know the roles the characters play and Ichigo is the main character. It definitely gets an anime watcher hooked because it makes one wonder how does a kid be a soul reaper and a high school student at the same time?As of April 19, 2021, I finally finished and am bummed that there a few holes left to tell from the manga that are not in the anime. The anime ended at a good point, but at the same time, I do not want it to end.",
        "Bleach is probably one of the worst anime of all time. It sits right next to Tokyo Vice. Ok maybe not that bad but it's not my favorite. It's one of those animes that ruined anime for me. 'We watch the titular protagonist Ichigo Kurasaki a teen student and he dies then comes back to life as a Soul Savor or something. Now he must save the world from the evil souls called I forget but I don't like it. Anyway it starts out as entertaining, fun and violent but Ichy butt is the worst protagonist because he has no personality.I have no idea what is happening through out the story because it drags on through 392 episodes. This story doesn't grab me because not only is just being some some sword carrying jerk not interest me I see no point into it. It's just Japanese story telling for the sake of being Japanese.This drags on at the Eizenhower arc.The animation in Bleach starts out as your typical stereotypical Japanese animated show. The characters have big blocky eyes and everything is detailed. The color choices aren't the best. Oh and most of the time it's jerky still bad animation that you'd expect from your typical filler fest. When the story begins to suck though THAT'S when you see some realistic stuff like guys shooting mythical guns. This maybe by Naruto team but everyone just floats around the screenSo yeah Bleach isn't for me. Thanks a lot ADULT SWIM!",

        "Before I start out, I want to say that my intent is not to mindlessly bash this show with this review. I tried my best to get into this show and view it as anything other then 'just another anime', but I failed. So if you are one of those Bleach-fanboys who can't handle this show getting any rating other then 10/10 stars please look away.A anime-watching friend of mine recommended this show to me, and for me to have a good anime to watch every evening is just great. But the moment I started watching the first episode, it went downhill in no time. First of all, Bleach looks like nothing special, and thats because it isn't. The animation looks cheesy and it doesn't manage to set itself apart from any other clich\u00e9 anime. The storyline is just a big pile of clich\u00e9's after another. Its basically a Dragonball Z set-up, but with a boy who can see ghosts and battles them with swords.Like I said the story is just a mess, and on top of that there are tons of fillers. Now let me ask a simple question to anime-fans; is it fun to watch something you rather don't? Is it a sign that you are having fun watching the anime when all you do is skip filler-episodes that have no purpose at all other then to stretch the show out a little more? Maybe its just me, but I don't like that at all. Some might say \"yeah but underneath those filler-episodes lies a interesting anime\". What is that then? The boring fight-scenes? The dialogue that is the most cheesy crap you'll ever see? Anyway.Keep in mind though like I said; I really tried to get into this show. I really tried to like it, but the clich\u00e9 and uninteresting animation, a weak plot and crappy characters just make it a pain to watch for me. If thats not enough, this show is also filled with chibi-crap. You know? To keep it \"funny\"? Or rather, annoying as hell. I don't mind chibi-stuff in the appropriate anime's, but in a anime that seems so focused on the action its just a annoying interruption. If you like action in a anime though, you can always watch something better then Bleach, like the new Hellsing OVA's which are awesome. This show's popularity however, I will never understand.",

        "\"Bleach\" is a standout anime series that has earned its place in the hearts of fans worldwide. What makes it truly exceptional is its ability to seamlessly blend intense, sword-clashing battles with a deeply intricate and engrossing story. The protagonist, Ichigo Kurosaki, is a character you can't help but root for as he navigates the challenging world of soul reapers, hollows, and other supernatural entities.\"Bleach\" isn't just about flashy battles; it's a story of personal growth and self-discovery. Ichigo's journey from an ordinary teenager to a formidable soul reaper is a testament to the power of determination and the bonds of friendship.In summary, \"Bleach\" is a classic in the anime world, offering a thrilling mix of action, mythology, and character-driven storytelling that continues to captivate audiences, making it a must-watch for anime enthusiasts of all ages.",
        "This show is the epitome of a watered down series. There are 366 episodes and out of those 366 there may be only 100 episodes worth of actual story. The rest of it is pure filler. I never understood this method of writing. I get that writers need to write a certain number of episodes, but why bother wasting time with episodes that have absolutely nothing to do with the main story at all? Who cares about Ichigo going to high school? There are entire episodes that are just about his normal life. WHO CARES?!For those of you who are planning on watching Bleach for the first time, I strongly recommend the use of an episode guide that highlights all of the filler shows and pointless story arcs that you can skip."

    "When They Cry": [
        "I recently watched this anime for the first time and initially wasn't sure what to make of it; I'd heard that is was a horror story but the animation style and opening episodes gave little suggestion of what was to come apart from the short pre-credit sequence in the first episode.Keiichi has recently moved from the city to the small, traditional village of Hinamizawa and has settled in at the local school where he has befriended a group of girls and joined their \"club\". This all suggests it is going to be a comedy with him getting into embarrassing situations with the girls, there is some of that but it leads on to murder and mayhem.The story repeats a few times during the series with slightly different situations leading to different characters taking the lead roll. All the stories however end in murder, often shockingly brutal murder and torture.We later learn that the repeating stories aren't merely showing how things could be different if different choices are made but time is repeating like a macabre version of \"Groundhog Day\", except that more than a day is repeated. We later learn that one of the girls is aware of this and is trying to change fate to prevent it from reoccurring, occasionally one or more of the others will remember something too but tends to write it off as a half remembered dream or d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.The story is fairly gripping and doesn't get boring as events repeat themselves. I found the juxtaposition of cute animated characters and disturbing imagery quite disturbing in a good way.",
        "When They Cry has is remarkably constructed, putting the same characters through a shifting story arc for much of the first season, then changing the perspective in a way that explains some, but not all, of the mysteries.The series focusses on a group of high school students. It starts off as a cutesy, manic show in which they play games and act silly and then there's strange stories and creepy characters and murders and then ... it starts over, but different.This made me concerned that the series was going to be like Lost and overload me with unanswered mysteries, but online research suggested that answer were coming, so I kept watching and found it all pretty interesting.What stopped me watching was the second-to-last story cycle of season one. I like my horror tingly and pretty mild, and When They Cry got *intense!* It freaked me out. Which for some will be a recommendation, but even though I've heard the final story cycle is less intense, I don't think I'll watch it.I did a bunch of more research to find out what was going on, and it seems there are answers and it sounds like they do make sense. And if I would get all the answers at the end of season 1 I might watch the last episodes, but apparently you just get some answers and have to watch the next season to really understand what's happening, so what's the point?Anyway, if you're less squeamish than I am and like very dark horror (much darker than, say Death Note, which I really liked) then you should definitely check this out.",
        "In a rural village which seems like your typical slice of life style genre. Keichi Mabara and his gal pals Mion, her older sister Shion, Rika, Rena and Satako all run a club at their school where they do nothing but hang out and have fun. This at first may look like your typical happy days however, when Oyashiro curse strike some either disappears or gets kill then Keichi or one of friend turn into psychos.All I can say is this anime was just a mess. With so much that is going on. From torcher, drug misuses, child abuse and characters having mental break downs.I have so many problems with this show and it's plot. Like I am all in for a good murder mystery and all but seriously why does the series keep on resetting itself whenever the characters get killed and all of a sudden they are back as if it was just a bad dream? Why is their very little to no detail about any of the characters pasts??Characters: I don't really have a favourite character though I will the twins were pretty but that doesn't stop them from being psychoses Shion is a manipulater and a yandere who seems to have this weird crush on Satoshi (who we only see in 4 episodes) and would kill anybody and anyone who goes against to the point where she even hurt her own twin sister. Mion is slightly better but is just a victim player, though in comparison she is cute when she is happy,Rena is a bit more tolerate able then the two but she is just another killer loli with an axe looking knife. Satako and Rika are just annoying as hell seriously Satako catch phrase \"nini\" is so cringey especally in that one episode where is she kept on crying \"I want my Nini!!!\" while Rika I don't get why do the writers give her this catch phrase \"Niphah\" which she keeps on saying as an attempt of being adorable. That word is annoying can't stand it. All of the other side characters either didn't have enough screentime or were just forgettable.The animation and art style. I know studio dean has known to be very inconsistent but boy where do i began. I will start by saying that some of the character designs aren't that bad but they aren't great either there were various animation errors Heck I know lighting in a room does sorta change the colour of certain objects but what I don't really get why did they had to make their skin colour so yellow they looked like charters from the Simpsons. Heck certain character movement and dialogue looked so awkward and out of sink.Voice acting. Ignoring the dub hating trolls in the reviews I don't think it was that bad but it could have been better. The doctor, the inspector and the twins had the best voices in the whole dubs. I also thought Keiichi's voice was a guilty pleasure. Satoshi i definitely preferred it over his Japanese voice. Rena and satako were nearly there but needed tweaking. A lot of the side characters either sounded generic or not very good. Rika's was just bad.The intro and opening were good thought.I just don't like this series i know it has sequels and a reboot which i am probably never going to watch. If you like this anime more power to you, this just isn't my taste.",
        "What kind of multiverse shtty mess that i was watching for hours. I sit through over all of the 26 episodes, yet the creator of this anime didnt reveal the truth or the main plot was unfinished. Totally not recommended and a big waste of time. Great voice casts but terrible plots. There was about 5 different yet same stories involving all the same characters (taking turn being villains and victims), which were hella boring for me. I could rate it lower but the voice casts were great.",
        "In the town of Hinamizawa, a group of young friends violently die shortly after the annual Wataganashi festival. For four episodes, these kids have been your eyes and ears into a World where paranoia and murder lurk just below the surface of a cute and loving exterior. And so the cycle begins again and again. Each time with different results. The story of Hinamizawa begins quite confusingly. As the chapters of each cycle develop, more hints as to what is really going on are dropped and it becomes more of a puzzle in which the audience has to put things into perspective. In almost a David Lynch manner, people are not who they appear to be, bizarre goings on are never fully revealed or solved (perhaps they never even happened) and a seemingly innocent act can descend into a massacre. I found the story to be a bit too kitsch for me in the beginning but it quickly finds its momentum and continues to build strength. When you first encounter the show it's all very scary and hard to understand. However, as it progresses, the edge of the show moves from violent horror to psychological terror. Knowing the fates of each of the young people from the beginning and seeing them struggle to survive or overcome their mistakes becomes increasingly depressing and tough to watch so even though the camera begins to look away when they're being murdered, it hurts even more.Truly disturbing at times and a testament to the strength of storytelling, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story or just unfiltered gore. Because there is a lot of it. Season One is by far the more violent of the two seasons so viewer discretion is advised. I'd also recommend that you source the second season for it explains fully the mystery of Hinamizawa. Also, watch it with subtitles, the dubbing is really rather poor.",
        "When I first heard about Higurashi, I thought it was going to be a slasher anime as I had seen the death scenes from around the time it first came out. Now, with the new season/remake, I decided to take the plunge and see what I thought of this franchise.So much more than what I expected! Definitely a solid bit of 2000's anime shenanigans, but the deeper plot at head gets revealed at a painstaking pace. With every few episodes, I was more and more engrossed in the story, trying to understand what in the world was happening. I haven't started any of the following seasons yet, but I finished this anime pleasantly traumatized and in love with the characters. If you have the patience, I would definitely recommend watching.",
        "So yes this is a nice harem Anime, oh wait, this is supposed to be a horror? You sure could have fooled me. In terms of horror and suspense Higurashi is a complete and utter failure. Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this. Okay seriously I am very disappointed in this series, considering I wanted a good suspense thriller that wasn't based purely on 100% excess and shock-factoring.Higurashi is a story of several different arcs. Each arc is a different version of the same story. In 1983 a young male transfer student comes to a small town. A town with a deadly secret. Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear. The story repeats in the same fashion through each arc usually ending in a brutal murder or murders of some one or some people, but something.As wonderful as the plot sounds it really isn't. The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a filler arc when something finally happens after 6 episodes. Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next, until something may just happen only for it to be a classic and clich\u00e9d horror blunder trick. Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it. So yes this series seriously lack suspense, half the time you feel more like you are watching a slice-of-life comedy instead of a thriller.Until some annoying detective constantly shows up to go over the SAME mystery we heard 5 episodes ago! The series can work up it's suspense and chill level, but fails to keep it long enough for us to get remotely interested. The whole time you are just questioning should I fast-forward or not? Sure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller. The series tries to build and build but the suspense just keeps falling down again. But there are a few eerie moments, (key word being few) such as the wonderful psychotic laughter from the tiny little ones. (see: http://tinyurl.com/2w5tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off. Other than that, the series heavily relies on it's dialog and music to give any sense of a creepy atmosphere. And that is all it has going for it.I can't express how dull of a horror this really was. Die hard horror lovers may want to stick to Elfen Lied, as for general suspense lovers (Like me) you may want to avoid this one. Apparently when cicadas cry, this horror dies.",
        "When They Cry is a perfect example of a horror/thriller done right. The show takes place in an isolated village in Japan, giving it an ominous feeling. As the show progresses, we learn that not everything that happens there is all innocent and nice. It starts out looking like a cute show intended for children, but there is no way a kid should be exposed to this. Starting around the second episode, we are introduced to several horrifying stories, that may or may not be true. Stories and events contradict each other, making the viewer decide for themselves what actually happened. Amazing characters, paired with the confusing and terrifying story make the show worth the time to watch.",
        "After looking at some reviews about the anime, I became excited to see this anime with all the praise it has gotten. But sadly, I quit watching around episode 6 and came to the conclusion that this anime wasn't as good as everyone made it out to be. Where do I start:Animation: Surprisingly, the animation was very...bland and sub-par to the other anime I have seen. The setting while well made were just dull to look at. Most of the environment weren't that great and fell flat most of what I had watched.Characters: There are times when I ask whether color theory is even a thing in Japan anymore, because this show has some of the worst color palettes I have ever seen. Colors were definitely never considered in this anime and could have actually made the show itself much more scary. Also, the fact that the character design are also stiff and feel restrained to the point that they too feel dull. Giving characters large cat eyes when they go insane did nothing for me. They weren't intimidating in the slightest and made me question how anyone could find the characters terrifying when their visible personality is never really shown.Also, just to get it out there, I hate moe stuff. Their actual designs and character makes me cringe and forces me to watch anime before the moe craze became a thing.Plot: The one thing that got under my skin the most weren't the characters, but the structure of the story. Literally the first second of the first episode starts with a gruesome scene, and then we get a boring backstory that lead up to the scene that takes several episodes to tell before we actually get back to it. The story being half moe slice of life and half psychological and suspenseful doesn't work when you reveal the gimmick to your anime this early. To be honest, I didn't care anyway about what happens since this anime loves to beat you over the head with its disgusting moe sh*t.Overall, the anime fails to interest me in its story with flat, boring characters and poor structure of storytelling. I do have to give credit to the soundtrack though, it was one of the few things I actually did like.",
        "I couldn't deal with the fact that this show was half filler. For a show this short and with so many small arcs it is disappointing that half the time something is happening and the other half it's a slice of life. The short arcs felt like they could have been expanded on, and instead of having these it should have focused on one or two more developed ones. The plot could have been good but in my opinion, while watchable, this anime was nowhere near as good as what I had been led to believe.",
        "Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni was such an amazing and uniquely mysterious anime that really does put you into question of what to believe in. Can certain incidents really only be explained with supernatural factors, or is there really just a logical explanation to everything that's happening? Questions like this are definitely what drive the viewer to wanting to figure what the real truth is behind all the mystery at the end of the day.For the first half of this series, we're introduced to Maebara Keiichi, a young teenage boy who moves to the small village of Hinamizawa. From there he meets many new friends, particularly when joining an afterschool club to get along better with a handful of his new classmates. But even though his first impressions are positive, he soon begins to learn of the dark secrets the village has within the shadows. As he chooses to dig in deeper to these secrets, his sense of paranoia begins to rise further as the days go by, while also realizing his newly made friends may also have secrets of their own.I love how an anime like this can make you be on your feet with suspense at times when it feels like you're not even meant to. I also love how this anime is very careful with the mysteries surrounding it, as well as when it's a proper time for each of them to come into play. You may not understand everything right away or even halfway, but the greatest thing about this anime is they leave no stone unturned.The characters are also a very big highlight in this series, as each of them present themselves as a very unique element for when the time comes. A great way they do this is splitting the focus of all these characters into separate arcs, that way you can learn more about the characters and why they are the way they are now. Something I like about these characters to is, as violent as some of them may be, the choices they make throughout the story are pretty realistic and/or understandable depending on the situation. You may even think that the most violent options are sometimes the right options in the end.I really like how they set up the animation at certain times in the story as well. When necessary, the goofy and fun moments can have the most bizarre styles of animation for some great humor. When necessary, the violent animations can make it seem like they're the creepiest things you've ever seen. At the end of the day, the anime is very good with introducing the proper atmospheres when needed to.Overall an amazing first season to a show that will definitely leave you wanting more on the search for finding out the truth. I would without a doubt recommend this anime to anyone interested in looking for another mystery anime to follow along with, while also encountering some amazing, caring, but also horrific events to be shown in the summer of 1983.",
        "When watching When they cry for myself I binged so much; Watching 14 episodes before 1 PM, waking up early to see as much as I could. Every episode leaves you wanting more, it is very mysterious and can be quite confusing but looking at that as a negative would be idiotic.The characters are lovable and yet very creepy, disturbing and sick as well; I don't want to spoil anything because you really should give this a shot; you will not be disappointed!As I said earlier though, it can be very confusing and it left me bewildered, almost nothing is answered even at the end and that is why you must be sure to watch when they cry:Kai (season 2) once you complete this. This anime will make you feel sick to your stomach at times and will make you want to die because of how cute it is at others, I laughed, I cried, its a very complex and beautiful work of art with just the right balance of morbidity, mystery and fun.Animation: 10/10 It makes you feel all sorts of freaked out, absolutely amazing and suits this style of anime perfectly.Voice acting: 10/10 There is never a moment where you feel as if the voice actors don't care, every scene is engaging and awesome and the cry's and screams of our beloved antagonists will never leave our minds.Re-watch(?): 10/10 I am actually planning to re-watch it soon myself and it has only been a year since I saw it. It is amazing, be sure to pay close attention to it because there is so much going on, you don't want to get lost and forget things. Even if you watch kai (season 2) some things (not essential things, don't worry) will be left unsolved, if you find yourself (like me) hungering to know all there is about When they cry, feel free to go and read the manga series which in English is called (wont let me say Japanese name) \"When Seagulls cry\", this is a different story line but it features some of the same characters, it is not a redoing of the anime. You will not find an anime better than When they cry.",
        "--Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, or When They Cry is a mystery anime with some cute characters, a few morbid scenes and several stories that are shown in sequence.--It revolves around the standard Japanese anime trick of not giving you enough information. The lack of information lets your imagination run wild, contemplating the reasons and motives of the events that take place, which can sometimes be a really good thing. When the story reveals one of those ideas to be right on the money, or when it's so inconceivable it sweeps you of your feet! However, this is not the case with When They Cry. The initial mystification caused by the apparently cute characters with dark secrets falls short when the characters' motives are reveled to be underdeveloped, oversimplified even. Grievous topics such as insanity and family abuse are touched, but shown with the depth of perspective you would get from reading about it in a news paper. Even when love is mentioned, it's used so trivially to motivate characters that all immersion is lost.--The animation aspect of the anime is also lacking. The colors of the characters will hurt your eyes due to distasteful and unappealing choices, while the backgrounds are pretty standard. The characters sometimes go into \"spooky mode\" which is overemphasized, like emotions in most anime. In this case however, the overreactions in \"spooky mode\" cross the line necessary to communicate the characters emotions to the viewer and wind up being outright grotesque.--The end of the anime is inconclusive and looks pretty much like a commercial for the video game from which this anime was adapted.--In short, When They Cry doesn't deserve it's misleading current score of 8,3 on a site like IMDb. This score is held by famous movies such as Rashomon, Snatch and Some Like it Hot. The more appropriate number, in my opinion is around 5, maybe even lower. Cheap thrills in a visually unstimulating package. Cheers!",
        "People who thinks it's trash, most likely is because that only watched the first season, which this page shows. You have to watch the complete series in order to understand the plot. EVERY THING WILL MAKES SENSE!!! PLEASE WATCH IT!!!\n-It's call Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kai.-\nI won't write any specific about the plot because you can really understands its beauty after watching it. At least, I think its epic.

        "Once upon a time, a young man who had grown to love those about him began noticing things; little things at that, and too many little things. He was then to die, and he did. Suddenly it began again. The young man was alive and he loved those about him; and they loved him. With each of the chapters, little more is revealed of why there are murders which occur during each 'Watanagashi Fesitval', however, with each chapter, more IS revealed through our ignorant Keiichi (our unlucky-as-all-hell protagonist who is to experience this all). Every chapter begins fresh, with time having seemed to rewind it's self and Keiichi having no memory of having suffered; as do also most every other of the characters.Each chapter can be divided as beginning simple and very humorous (Rena, the secondary character, has an obsession towards cute things and finds garbage and the like as such), and this will contrast with it's inevitable climax (that tends to be extreme in that some or most of the character die, and in brutal ways). The transition between points A and B is very organic and unclean, in that it never seems too 'planned out'.The characters become very interesting through this transition. Again, the character of Rena begins cute and innocent (moe urges growing!) though she is not without her 'moments' during point B. The character of Keiichi changes also. During each 'begining', he is 'simple', and during point B, he is then already paranoid towards every of the supporting cast. This change only adds to the suspense which builds it's self gradually. This show is perfect, in that it masters what even most films try and cannot: the ability over an audience's fear, and it uses little gore so to do this (though that's not to say that it's without such 'scenes'). Watch this show and enjoy it's intro sequence (which I think captures the exact feel of the show it self).The only thing negative I can say about this show is that it's English voice cast is weak, or course, and that it's animation dose not transition with it's subject matter (it's too cute during point B, but I'm just complaining for the sake of complaining about something). 10/10",
        "This series was so immensely pleasurable to watch. It's a horrific and slightly sadistic series that leaves you constantly guessing what's really going on in this small haunting rural village. I must admit though that I couldn't bring myself to complete it. Not because I was scared or anything, but because the explanations for why things were happening were unfolding and I didn't like it. I was hooked on the series from the beginning to around the last few episodes simply because I never really knew why things were happening the way they were. I was blissfully confused and baffled throughout the whole series, and the final episodes were like getting smacked upside the head with the facts of all the episodes previously. From what I've read though, those final episodes didn't explain everything all the way anyway, so maybe its worth watching. For me personally though, I felt that explaining the mysteries of the village the series takes place in took away from the overall appeal. If you love mysteries and creepy moe characters and can handle some gore, I highly recommend that you at least watch the first few episodes. If you aren't completely hooked then I'd say leave the series alone and watch something you'd find more fulfilling.Oh and by the way, for those comparing to Elfen Lied, this series is tens times better and creepier as opposed to being composed of pure gore.",
        "This is basically an anime that tries to tell the story of the first four chapters of the Visual Novel. Even though the first four chapters take about 50-60 hours to read, and this anime is alot shorter than that, it does indeed do a good job of bringing it's Story to this medium. I truly enjoyed this experience. Make sure to watch the second season, so you can see what happens in the concluding chapters of the Visual Novel(chapters 5-8.)",
        "Rika is one of the most badass characters in anime. Hanyuu says that she has lived through a hundred years of the repeating timeline. Assuming each timeline lasted 2 weeks, that's 2,600 timelines. And in each one she watched her friends and everyone else either murder each other or otherwise die in horrible ways. Yet despite all of that, she manages to keep a warm and friendly demeanor.",
        "I LOVE this anime. It's my second favorite (After One Piece). The girls are all so cute(Especially Rena and Rika *Ni-pah!*). The story's original, and the characters all have wonderful personalities.However this anime does get very dark at times and may not be suitable for everyone as it DOES contain stuff like murder, child abuse, child torture, beatings, and the story keeps going back which may get on some peoples' nerves. However, aside from all this, it really is a great anime and in my opinion, is a true masterpiece in both story and horror. A must see for any horror fan.BEWARE THE KILLER LOLIS.",
        "Simply put...NOT FOR CHILDREN!A lot of anime is somewhat violent and sometimes disturbing but Higurashi is something else! The violence is untamed and brutal. The story is surrounding a little village that is led by 3 families. It all starts when a young boy Keichii moves to the little village from the city in the month of June 1983. He makes friends with 3 girls, Rena, Mion (and later her twin sister Shion), Satoko and Rika. All seems well until he learns the village has a lot of secrets of murder and unexplained deaths. In a series of different chapters (arcs) the story is repeated all based around each character in turn. Each character goes mad and a lot of the time at least one of the group of friends is murdered brutally by one another. The stories explore murder, suspicion and even aliens! It's not something i would recommend to everyone but certainly one I'd recommend to those who don't mind a bit of violence!",
        "Now this show, has got to be one of the best cartoons that Japan had to offer. To think of the plot, think of Happy Tree Friends meeting Pokemon. In the show, a boy named Keiichi, moves to the town of Hiniwazama. There he meets these girls, and they start acting rather strange. On a day that is called the Day of Cotton (I presume), one person is brutally murdered, and one is spirited away by \"demons.\" They believe that their local god was responsible for this, and believed that he was judging them. Now the plot, is kind of a mind screw, but somehow, a loop occurs over and over, and the characters enter another world after they had failed in one. In season two, it was explained that the villain was a nurse named Takano Miyo (whom I despise) who was trying to kill Rika, to see if the village would fall with her, and become God (OF COURSE!). And it was also revealed that there was a disease called the Hiniwazama Syndrome, that made all the characters crazy, and Miyo used the disease to kill off her villagers. Despite it being dark, it was rather enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend it to children though, unless they watch it with their parents.",
        "Nothing makes sense, so everything makes sense. Weird stuff all time. Some things were creepy and others made me laugh",
        "I said good but this show is amazing...After watching the first episode most people will discard it as a kids show, personally, I wouldn't let my kids anyway near this show, although I like horror movies and shows it's really rare for me to feel horror myself, this show though, did it like no other.The story takes place in a small village, around a group of small kids (I wold guess the ages between 8 and 14, but that's all this is), although the village gives you a warm and soothing feeling, it will, by the end of each story, make you feel isolated and suffocating, the children are perky and sweet at the beginning (a little too much, some will say), are really dark and scary at the begging, The show divide to few stories, all around the same time of the year, it runs as a detective story from different angles, slowly gaining more details about the dark past of the village and it's people.You should watch the whole show, though, if you expect to understand any of it (even twice won't hurt, if you'll like it as much as I do), but only after seeing the sequel \"Higurashi no naku koro ni kai\" (which is not half as good, and can't really be called \"horror\") you'll really understand more then a few pieces.And I'll finish in a few words of warning, this is one of the best Japanese anime shows ever created, but it really ISN'T FOR THE FAINT OF HEARTS, enjoy",
        "An anime with adorable character designs... then stuff happens. Creepy stuff. This is not an anime for kids or those who do not like seeing extreme forms of torture gore... Otherwise, it's an amazing mystery anime for you. It's average in that it follows the life of a teenage boy, surrounded by his female schoolmates... but the commonness of it ends there. A horrific tale breaks out at about the halfway point of each arc, revealing a more gritty atmosphere and art style. From start to end, I found myself forming theories in my head as to what is truly going on. As stated before, the art style is not of high quality, but that was never really an issue for me. I find that its unique... \"expressions\" expressed by some of the characters would not have the desired shocking effect otherwise. The sound is also spot on. Constantly having the cicada chirps fill the otherwise empty soundscape creates a very unique kind of tension. I was actually surprised when I heard this was a visual novel first, given that I can usually tell by clich\u00e9 elements... but there were next to none that I noticed. Overall, a beautiful show that I highly recommend to any horror/mystery/anime fan.",
        "This delightfully prepared anime has one of the best plots I've ever seen.In style, the anime employs cuteness, fun and games to ease you into it just to make the creepy parts even more creepy. Always shocks you at the right moment. Kept me up on my seat the whole time.Starts with a lovely intro music with thoughtfully written lyrics, if you're into that kind of thing. I am.What is really wonderful about this anime though, was the mind blowing quality of the subs provided by WindFS, who even included their often cryptic messages to us somehow (look out for them). Only this feature kept me going excitedly through just a few monotonous moments this anime had to offer.Also has a sequel named Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, for which all my previous comments still apply. And there is a second sequel named Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei, which is a lot different, though equally elegant."

    "Dragon Ball": [
        "This was a childhood favourite of mine. Even as a child I found it much better than Pokemon and Beyblade, both of which I found predictable and repetitive, and I still do. Along with Avatar:The Last Airbender, Dragonball Z is one of the most creative, coolest and most epic cartoon series I have had the fortune to see.The animation is really quite impressive, and doesn't show its age. The backgrounds have an ethereal quality to them, the colours are eye-popping with unique shades to them and the character designs are impressive too. Also the visual effects are very, very good and enhance rather than distract, and there is some great-looking animation in the well choreographed fight sequences.The music is another strong asset. Not just the iconic theme tune, but the background music fits perfectly. The stories have outstanding ideas and mature themes and any conflict is done in a resourceful and compelling way. The writing is also excellent and induces thought, the characters are immensely likable with great personalities and the voice acting fits the characters perfectly.To cut a long story short, this series is really quite wonderful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
        "I tried watching this again years after it came out. it is basically unwatchable from all the filler (1 viewing)",
        "I love DB however there is a reason why I don't rewatch it.The fights, saga and story is too long. It lasts over 200 episodes to finish off a saga and fight.Back as a child YTV use to replay DBZ all the time. That means I had to watch 200 episodes for 5 years again and again just to see who wins in the frieza fight.The only way I knew was when I was grown and searched it on YouTube.The show is fine for what it is. Its the long-drawn-out fights.DB on a general whole is not rewatchable because it's a time waster show. Not even being locked down will make me sit through 200 pointless epsiodes of a fight.",
        "When it comes to the 2-D animation effects of 1996's \"Dragon Ball GT\" - I, for one, certainly don't have any real complaints to beef about there. Nope. Visually speaking - This TV program delivered some really satisfactory anime, for the most part.But - On the other hand - When it came down to the irritating, pipsqueak characters who (unfortunately) dominated a good part of Dragon Ball GT's story-lines - That, of course, was another matter. Indeed.Man-o-man - These snivelling, irksome, little rugrats continually grated on my nerves, big-time.By the overall immaturity and incessant whining and bickering that took place amongst these juvenile brats, it became plainly obvious (from my perspective) that Dragon Ball GT was, indeed, geared to an audience-mentality so infantile that I just couldn't relate to it on any level, whatsoever.And, so - (Because of this total annoyance) - I just gave up on watching Dragon Ball GT after viewing only 4 of its episodes.",
        "''Dragon Ball Z'' is the story of Son Goku already an adult. Piccolo is a friend, among other fighters that in Goku's childhood were enemies, and in the first episodes Goku shows Gohan to them. In the beginning, Gohan looks to be a weak kid, without any kind of powers : but when Goku needs to fight abroad the Earth, Gohan is going to be trained by Piccolo. (Who eventually will have an affection for the boy) Dragon Ball Z is the long-running sequel to the anime Dragon Ball. The series is a close adaptation of the second and longer then ''Dragon Ball''. Goku, with his companions, needs to defend the Earth and many other planets against various villains, much more powerful then the first Dragon Ball.We have new characters, like Vegeta and much more action. Gohan will be older in the series too, and Chichi and Goku are going to have another son, Goten.In my opinion this is the best version of the series.",
        "\"Dragonball Z\" wasn't the first anime I got introduced to. But is the first series that made an impact on me. I never could have dreamed that a cartoon with (what seemed like) so many goofy characters could move me so much. The first thing that I noticed that was so different from other shows were the epic battles. It took several episodes for a battle to finish. When I saw the battle between Goku and Frieza on Cartoon Network I got hooked immediately. At that time there wasn't a show that was as exciting as \"Dragonball Z\". This was a show that had great action,a lot of comedy and even drama. \"Dragonball Z was full of surprises and you didn't know what to expect. OK,after a few seasons the story may got predictable but it still had the best action ever seen in a cartoon. But the most important thing as should be in every show were the characters. Even the most clumsy and useless characters managed to do something that made you care for them. I have re watched some episodes and they still are very effective and exciting. \"Dragonball Z\" is here to stay forever,a true classic!",
        "Dragonball Z is a great anime series. Unlike a lot of that anime garbage, Dragonball Z has story and cutting edge action. It has everything a good show needs. Good writing, comedy, drama, adventure, suspense and lots of action. There are also a lot of interesting characters. Dragonball Z is worth watching.",
        "My introduction to \"Dragon Ball Z\" was similar to most people who grew up in the 90's. It was on Toonami, it looked strange at first, but it hooked me with the story, characters, music and just being the most hype thing ever. Soon I started recording episode of the show on VHS. I had the VHS set of SLP so I could fit about 18 episodes on one VHS tape. It began with the \"Ocean Dub\" then evolved to the \"Funimation Dub\" we know today. I watched this show religiously. And with recording it, I would watch each episode a second time once my brother got back from gymnastics. Then I would watch the episode a third time with my friend from school.When I say in the title that this show is the \"most influential\" I mean it in two ways. First is the impact it had on a worldwide scale. Anime finally got its foothold in the American market. It had tried previously as far back as Astro Boy, stuff like Speed Racer and the great Miyazaki films. But those were all seen as niche markets that didn't show much promise. Dragon Ball Z changed that. Teamed up with Cartoon Network's prime time Toonami block, those commercials and TV Spots are some of the coolest advertisements you're going to see. Look back at the most searched things on Yahoo through 1998-2004 and you'll find that Dragon Ball Z was always in the top 10. Dragon Ball Z started an anime revolution that is still being felt to this day. It effected TV, movies and even video games. Even film makers like the Wachowski's and Michael B. Jordan can credit their inspiration back to this show.The second way this show is the most influential, is on a personal level. In my life I have sunk more hours into watching this show than any other. I have seen 3 different English dubs of show. Watched all the various movies and other TV shows that come with it. I have played most of the video games and read the manga. Through their focus on fighting and training, it motivated me to lose weight and get into shape. The way the characters are able to rise up through any challenges that come their way motivated me to do hard things.OK, I have rambled. I bring all this up to demonstrate the impact the show has made both worldwide and personally. It is impossible for me to do a completely objective review of the show. Outside of its impact, how is the show itself? Really really good. One of the best. Admittedly there are some animation errors, recycled animation, pace breaking filler, and the Buu Saga, (the last 6 seasons) really drags on. But, I don't care. To me, this show is a 10 out of 10, everything I could have wished for.",
        "'Dragon Ball Z' isn't much different from 'Dragon Ball'. It continues the success of the first one by making use of the same basic formula: martial arts, Japanese stuff and very violent battles between the good and the bad. With the exception of some new characters, most characters are the same from the previous version of this anime TV show.Basically what I said about 'Dragon Ball' can be applied to this one, so there's not much to add. However, 'Dragon Ball Z' is extremely violent (even more so than the original) and it's not unusual to see the characters bleeding, severely injured from the battles's violence. And each new villain is more dangerous and powerful than the previous one, leading to increasingly aggressive battles. Each new ones seems to be invincible. True, the good guys always win, but that's always after long-lasting wars until they have no more strength.Yet, despite all the violence contained, this and the previous version also have their moments of comedy and peace of mind.I remember when 'Dragon Ball Z' came out to replace the older version. I never understood the reason of the 'Z' in its title. And I remember very well singing its theme song many times, which I thought was cool.Anyway, this anime show can become very addictive. For those who are parents, I advice you to be careful with the interpretation your kids make out of it and with the influence it may have on them. To the kids I also let an advice about the things they see in this: do not try this at home!",
        "Amongst most rubbish I was forced to watch as back in my childhood days, this stands out as an instant classic. I started watching it around the Ginyu saga when I was probably younger than seven or eight, and as a child I looked forward eagerly to each episode like no other show before and few since. \"Next time on Dragonball Z\u0085\", it was great. As a kid, it seemed quite different from the kind of action the USA was putting out, and the fights were unbelievable. However, some have lambasted it as over-lengthy, bad-dubbing and a terrible English score.My, my shame, on all of you, criticizing your own childhood. But as it goes, I will enlighten those critics. For starters, over lengthy? It was simply a very, very, long tale of epic proportions told in small and detailed bits. If you've watched it and paid attention to the character's reactions to things, it will dawn you this is on the level of a Greek tragedy. Some of the filler was unnecessary but a lot of it was either funny or added to the fights. Overall if you hate filler, \"Dragonball Z Kai\" is now available for viewing. Bad dubbing? Sean Schemmel,, Christopher Sabat, Eric Vale, if you hated the dubbing it was probably due to some of the cheesy lines they incorporated. However, as you may or may not know the original Japanese cut is free of this. What exactly did you expect, seeing as it was being broad casted on prime time, and not late night animes like you would often see on \"Adult Swim\". Granted, it's somewhat better, but if that's what you want just purchase the season box sets, which contain several language and audio options, plus revised dialog. Bad score, please! The score by Faulconer is fresh, something new and it sharpens the action to an irresistible point. Once more, if you don't like it, the season box sets can let you enjoy the also exhilarating Japanese score in 5.1 surround sound, awesome! Aside from those ludicrous claims, I believe DBZ holds together as a timeless show with many themes. Themes of pride, loyalty, courage and endurance. The characters develop continuously from start to finish, the most noteworthy of them being Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo and (Future) Trunks. While kids will find it hard not to watch, there's a fair level of violence and even disturbing character moments. The villains were never boring and always so varied from one another. Frieza with his cold and calculating persona, Cell with his thirst for greater challenges and power, and Buu in all his insanity. The fights are of course were always amazing, brutal and here and there even funny. Akira Toriyama has created a masterpiece that will be passed on for generations.The artwork is stunning despite the age. Owning all the seasons as I do, makes you realize that a very select few episodes had a somewhat less standard look to them, but these are scattered about and one could hardly notice. Anyways, far from a brainless smack down, DBZ takes you on a adventurous adrenaline fueled thrill ride and yet deliverers emotionally and comically as well. If you're a true fan make sure to get the seasons and pass this on to your siblings or children, as I have.",
        "Dragon Ball Z was the first anime I ever watched, setting the standard for what anime is like and what it should be. I've gone on and watched more anime since, and that standard has long since been surpassed. Nevertheless, Dragon Ball Z will always hold a special place in my heart.Despite this, Dragon Ball Z is still far from great. The length is my biggest issue. Maybe its just me, but I like to be done a series in twenty episodes. Of course, I make plenty of exceptions, but that's my preference. At the time, I thought all anime was just one hundred plus episodes and that I just had to deal with it. Either way, Dragon Ball Z is just too long. The fights drag on and never change, and by the end of an episode I always feel like nothing has been accomplished (and this happens a lot). I was rarely excited by the fights because of this, and that really took away from the enjoyment of watching them. The show's story isn't great either. Sure, this is a show about fighting, but it never changes. Apparently every evil alien in the universe has the same life goal in mind. The show starts to get really stale by the second story arc. The characters for the most part are done well enough. The only major growth seems to be in physical strength, but occasionally we get a character like Vegeta who shows incredible development through all nine seasons, making him the real star of the show. Still, his character struggled in terms of life goals, considering it never changed. Overall Dragon Ball Z is a classic example of a really, really long anime. In the end, I wouldn't say it was worth it. I wouldn't suggest you watch this show (unless you've already started it/watched it). It's not that it's bad or anything, it's just not worth it in the end. Sure, Vegeta's journey throughout the show is great, but in the grand scheme of things, it wasn't worth it. Despite my rating, I wouldn't recommend Dragon Ball Z. But if you want to watch it still, then go right ahead. It's better then plenty of other shows that I've seen, but easily worse then a lot of others. If you loved it, then I can respect that, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.",
        "The sound is fine. If you're watching the show in English FUNimation has given the show a brand new 5.1 surround sound mix, which sounds excellent on a surround sound system. If you're like me though, and prefer to watch the show in it's original Japanese language track, you'll find the same mono track that was presented on all the other single disk releases of the show. With (what surely sounds like) a fatal flaw when it comes to the viewing of the show, many of you may be wondering why you'd want to bother with the show at all. Well, two things: Picture and price. Yes, the display of the show may be the biggest problem for this show, but the restoration is also one of the brightest things about the DVD. While not perfect, \"Dragon Ball Z\" has never looked this good before on DVD. The colors are mostly perfect, and the tone is very consistent, with only some grain to be found in certain spots. Regardless what you think of the widescreen presentation, the look of the picture is excellent.Then there's the fact that this DVD set retails for $50 and contains the first 39 episodes. I remember spending $20 on a \"Dragon Ball Z\" DVD with three episodes on it. If you bought the single disk releases on sale for $16 each (and this is being generous, as most single disk \"Dragon Ball Z\" DVD's will cost you $20 easily), then you'd spend around $250 by the time you got up to episode 39. Considering you can get \"Dragon Ball Z: Season One\" on sale for $30-$35 at most places, this is the cheapest \"Dragon Ball Z\" has ever been on DVD. At this rate, $250 will get you the whole show. All 291 episodes for what you would originally pay for the privilege to own 39 episodes. Despite the issues with the widescreen, it's hard to argue when the savings are that huge. Whether or not the widescreen issue is enough to scare you away from this DVD is entirely up to you.Re-watching the show again after I hadn't seen it for several years has made me see it in an entirely different light. It no longer seems to be the greatest action show I remember it to be. Some of the fights are rather silly looking, there are stretches of time that contain way too much filler, and several episodes early on in the show seem to wasting time while they are waiting for the story to come around. That said, when the show is good it's very good. Character development in these early episodes is excellent, there are many heartbreaking moments, and to actually go back to when Goku wasn't a Super Saiyan is a revelation as it shows me that it was more interesting to see these characters grow stronger then it was to watch them...well, BE stronger! It's not a perfect show, but a good portion of the episodes on this set do hold up quite well, and there's a reason we'll still be watching \"Dragon Ball Z\" several years from now. . For now though, I think I can live with these sets. On that note though, why is Vegeta on the cover for Season One while Goku gets banished to being on the cover of Season Two?",
        "A great series indeed with compelling characters and arcs it's so enthralling but isn't free from issue either certain drawbacks related to power and originality etc. Regardless the development of character over the whole dragon ball series is impressive and done to such a great degree",
        "Is it true? Is this stupid show finally ending? I heard that it was going to end sometime this year since another follow up would start (Dragonball GT which I hear really sucks) this fall on CN. What a relief.Anyways, this show to me sucks for several reasons: First off the fighting sequences. It takes like 30 episodes for a single fight to start, and end. How in the blue hell can they make a fight last 30 episodes long like that? Christ Lupin the 3rd could steal 30 exotic treasures(as well as flirting on his Fuji-Cakes in between) in 30 episodes while this takes 30 episodes for ONE FIGHT!Second, the whole hair thing. Are Goku and company Punk rock fans, or do they love having bedhead? The hair thing is so ANNOYING! Do they have hair combs on the planet they live on? Probably not.Third, and final thing is again the fighting. It's the same cliched fighting: Punch, kick, punch, kick, punch, or Kick, punch, kick, punch, kick with their super powers thrown in for flavor. It's the same all the darn time!!!Thank god this show is over, because now me, and many other DBZ haters won't have to gripe about it anymore....By the way, enjoy your DragonBall GT folks, and watch it destroy the franchise. BWAAHAAHAAAHAAA!!!!",
        "Just like Pokemon, this show has made a lot of money on merchandising such as trading cards, video games, manga, etc. But don't focus your attention on that. There has been many people who have heard of this show. Yes, Cartoon Network is one of the largest companies to broadcast animated cartoons for children and adults (Adult Swim). So, there is a large chance you can ask a kid what they think of Dragon Ball Z.Dragon Ball Z is full of the exciting adventures of Goku, Gohan, and more characters you will discover on the way! There are so many sagas of this exciting show. Freeza, Cell, Majin Buu, and more. I will never forget them.Dragon Ball Z continues off from Dragon Ball, and I have to say, this is much better. Much better than Dragon Ball GT. It's more violent. Although, you have to look pass the censoring they did for children and think of what they should have kept and just forget about children, and air it on Adult Swim. That's what they should have done. Also, Dragon Ball seems too much for children. Not fun.",
        "First time that I watch a Japanese Anime.Dragon Ball Z is a Japanese martial arts / action / adventure series, which in the first season deals with Son Goku / Son Gohan's roots and a danger lurking above the ground.It quickly dawns on you that there is an extensive and extensive lore in the series, which is actually very exciting to dive into. However, the season is really, really really long, and with countless training sessions and filler episodes, the season could easily be drastically cut to the bone. , without damaging the series.There are quite insane story choices along the way, although not a single character is safe, especially at the end of the season there is a kind of overriding security around our very central heroes. This slightly spoils the otherwise intense atmosphere. Moreover, it is very clear that the series was made long before metoo, which is a bit funny.Finally, Dragon Ball Z is one of the great childhood memories, so I really hope the series holds water going forward.Hopes for season 2\nMore elaborate world buildingA shorter seasonMore heady fights",

        "I'll start off by admitting that I'm not the biggest fan of anime (or at least, English-dubbed anime).  Anyway, I'll move on to my review -   My younger brother used to love this show when he was much younger (he's 12, I'm 13), so I (naturally) sat through some episodes.  Well . ..   THEY SUCKED!   I'll give fans of this show the benefit of the doubt - I've never seen the undubbed Japanese version, so THAT might be good.  The American version is, as I said, pathetic.  The scenes with Trunks or whoever are impossible to tell what the hell the point is or what's going on.  (Or maybe it's filler.)  Like other dubbed anime dialogue, the writing WREAKS and is horrible.  I'll comment on \"pop culture\" references in American-dubbed anime in an upcoming review of \"Pokemon\", because I've watched almost all of the episodes of that show.     Recently, I sat down and watched an episode on my own, to be fair.  It wasn't any better.   To be fair, this show is better than most other anime garbage (that I've seen) - \"Sailor Moon\", \"Pokemon\", \"Monster Rancher\", et al - that I've seen. But is that really a complement?   Four stars because it's not the worst out there.",
        "One of the first well known animes, DBZ took a step in Japanese animation that no one has ever seen before. Although before this there was Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z is not only better known, but a lot more praised. When I think of anime, the first thing I think of is this awesome show. Action packed and epic as crap, this show put an icon on the Japanese animation industry.The story follows a grown up Goku, (main character of Dragon Ball where he was a kid, for those not familiar) as he and his friends battle an onslaught of enemies all around the universe looking to take over the world. Goku and his friends will protect the world from devastation with an iron fist, defending all that is good.The first show, Dragon Ball, was Goku as a kid battling the foes of Earth. Now, it's any made up planet name you can think of. This show probably has it. So many awesome characters in this show, as well as awesome villains. Animation and colors are all amazing, the action is sick nasty, and the adventure is irresistible. Goku runs into all kinds of different races, beings, and enemies he never thought existed.The show is 291 episodes long, and if that's not enough for you, 13 specials (or movies) for your entertainment as well. Iv'e seen all of the English dubbed and Japanese subbed. I can honestly say I prefer the Japanese subbed better. Better voices, better dialogue, and just all around sounds better. Dubbed is still pretty good, but i'd stick with subbed.This show pretty much made anime popular. The only other anime I can think of in the 1980s was Dragon Ball, also worth checking out. So this show pretty much invented the popularity in anime. Dragon Ball Z is everywhere you see. Even when you don't know it. It's referenced so much, and is every kid's favorite thing to watch, well mine anyway.If you are going to watch it, I recommend watching Dragon Ball first, so you can follow the story chronologically. Dragon Ball starts with Goku as a kid, him meeting Bulma, all the way to until he's a teenager. Then five years later, it jumps into Dragon Ball Z, with a grown up Goku. By the end of DBZ, it is Goku as a grandpa. If you're really interested, then go ahead and watch Dragon Ball GT, the show after DBZ. It's not as good as the other two, but if you're curious enough, or a hardcore fan like me, then go ahead. I watched it, and it's pretty much worth checking out.If you're looking for a good anime to watch, look no further. This show will blow your mind to no end. It's fast, action packed, well made, creative, and adventurous as crap. It truly is an icon in its own mind, and anybody else with half a mind would say so as well. Without a doubt the #1 best anime show in the world! 10/10",
        "I have been watching DragonBall Z, for 15 years since 1999. I own some of the Season DVDs you can buy online or sometimes find in places like Walmart. Dragon Ball Z is timeless, I mean it's interesting to think how the episodes you watched aired in the USA in the late '90s early 2000s, and they even aired earlier in Japan in the '80s and '90s. Watching this show years later, it does not look old or lose it's appeal, some of the graphics from the older episodes, mostly DragonBall look a little old. DragonBall Z is the version they started out with in the USA before DragonBall thinking DragonBall Z would get more viewers. It used to be on Cartoon Network on Toonami. They later would have DragonBall be part of Toonami to show the origin of the story. Then, they'd later do DragonBall GT, but DragonBall GT is non- cannon and written by somebody else. Most of us don't like GT as much. By all means, DragonBall Z has been a huge success. I've read interviews from the guy who wrote the series on the Manga, Akira Toriyama. He did not anticipate the series going on for so long. From what I read, Toriyama did not think much about writing after the first Saga Emperor Pilaf when he started the series. He would later think of ending the series after the Frieza and Cell Sagas. But, the success of the series had him continue writing it and coming up with new awesome story lines. Obviously, the series was awesome enough for him to continue writing it. Though some of the things he wrote did not seem well thought out of and he was probably trying to hurry up the series. For example, most of us do not like the series finale of DragonBall Z. There were also some things Toriyama obviously either forgot or stopped caring about from older episodes to later episodes. I personally am amazed at the success of DragonBall Z. People still talk about that show regularly even when it no longer is airing. I've worked at Amazon and some of the most popular franchise I saw on the shelves would be from DragonBall Z, mostly DVDs. You can also see so many clips from the show on YouTube and so many searches on Google for DragonBall Z showing it's a living legend. On YouTube if you want to hear about people who are fans of the series and have thought well of questions we have of the series and how to answer them you can go to Blackenfist and Qaamans Land. You can also Google Search any episode throughout the entire series, you could do a search on any attack, any character even like a background character from one episode. You can basically search like any noun that is from the DragonBall Z World and your top results will most likely be DragonBall Wiki where you can get a full in depth view on your search for what is known about it. So, I've talked about the success of DragonBall Z, I'll now talk about what makes it a good TV show. Well, it has a really good story line you're likely to get into if it interests you, and like a Soap Opera although this show isn't a Soap Opera, the story line is continuous where each episode continues where the last one left off, and the episodes frequently end at an exciting part where we will want to see what happens next. The show by all means is an empowering show, when I watch it I'll feel motivated to push myself harder as you see characters throughout the series training and always getting stronger. Sometimes it even shows real workouts we could be doing. So, the fact that we see characters that like to work out and continue to push themselves hard is motivational. The show has awesome fighting, which is one of the main reasons for the popularity of the show, the action. But, I don't see how you could not see the action in certain episodes and not think of it as epic. The characters in that show can also be role models, mostly Goku as he is the main character throughout the series. Goku is always cheerful and friendly. Goku has a mind set where he does not give up and can always think of a way to win the toughest fights. Well, thanks for reading. It's nice to write a review on a TV show I've been a fan of for so long and that never gets old.",
        "This is the best Anime ever. I love this as much as the old Pok\u00e9mon show. Goku is my favorite character in this and Gohan was at his best when he fought against Cell in the Cell Games saga. It also has a great story to it. I mean Goku is like the anime version of Superman. He crash lands on Earth as a baby from Planet Vegeta, gets his memory jumbled up by falling into a gorge and hitting his head on a rock and becomes good instead of evil like the other Saiyans were. Goku is one of the best fictional heroes ever and is totally awesome even after he dies twice. Vegeta is an awesome character too. Also when I saw the censored version of this as a kid I never realized that Master Roshi was really an old pervert. Looking at that now is funny. lol. I also found it funny and awesome when Super Saiyan Goku slaps Frieza on planet Namek when it was about to explode. This show is also the best that Toonami has to offer and it's a good thing that Toonami is back on Adult Swim and showing the Kai version of this. Also the best moment of Goku using the Spirit Bomb is when he uses it on Majin Buu. This is a great anime here. Enough said.",
        "Man, Dragon Ball (of what I call it, \"Dragon Bore\") series is such a boring and one of the most overrated anime series ever (besides Sailor Moon, Pokemon and Evangellion).From very ugly animation and character designs, to nonsensical plots that are about as deep and involving as a World Wide Wrestling match, Dragon has it. Seems like nothing gets accomplished in this show. All it is basically, is one bing long drawn out anime wrestling match. If you want a GOOD mythological based Anime, watch \"The Storm Riders\" anime series or the live action movie version too. I bet Wind and Frost could pound every character on this show.",
        "A dub worse than Lupin the 3rd, the Yu Yu Hakusho movie, and The Slayers put together.Dragonball Z rules.  FUNimation does not.  While DBZ originally had the characters acting mature, even in the face of the end of the world, FUNimation decided to take something great, and turn it into a show aimed for two year olds!  The characters now speak out lines that only braindead kids that are one year old would possibly laugh at.  Goku is a big change, the battle-ready warrior is now a typical comic book superhero, compltete with lame one note wise cracks!  AAAARRRRRRAAAAGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  Also, they took the wonderful music out from the original Japanese version, and replaced it with horrible synthesized tunes!  They even change major story plot points, not caring what the viewers will think.  A lot of people claim to hate Dragonball Z, but you know what?  I think that those same people have only seen the horrible U.S. version, and if I had to listen to preschool-type dialogue all the time, I'd probably hate it too.BOTTOM LINE:  FUNimation will pay.  At least the DVDs are out.",
        "Dragon Ball Z (1989-2003) is a popular anime that continues the adventures of Son Goku, in his adult life.The anime displays important life lessons and morals such as pride, kindness, and forgiveness. Even as an adult, you can learn a thing or 2 from this anime by witnessing Goku's personality and unusual moral choices. The show doesn't take itself too seriously thus it provides a lighthearted atmosphere and an easy-to-follow story that will certainly boost your mood and entertain you. The voice acting in the dubbed version is OUTSTANDING! There are a lot of powering up and screaming scenes in the show but Sean Schemmel and many others totally nailed it! Respect to you all!Now let's move to the negative parts of the show. There are plenty of problems when it comes to the story. Some \"rules\" or \"facts\" get introduced but they disappear randomly. One of the weirdest things is probably the \"Dragon Balls\" and the way they are used. Also, the show gets a bit repetitive after a while to the point where you can sort of figure out a pattern in the narrative making things a bit too predictable. The show also has a lot of drawn-out fights or scenes making it way longer than it should be.All in all, Dragon Ball Z (1989-2003) is an amusing show with a simple formula and likable characters. Maybe it's the nostalgia in me talking but I enjoyed the show!"

    "The Twelve Kingdoms": [
        "This is an interesting series that holds attention (on and off), but does have some issues:Initially the primary character is such a whiny, helpless wimp she makes one want to watch something else instead . However if the viewer hangs in there, this trait turns out to be intentional, a foundation for further character development.Too many characters in this have minimal development and are largely irrelevant to the overall developing story. This presents a strange paradox in complexity through diversity, but so much diversity that little of it is fully developed.The worst flaw (in my opinion) is the excessive and extreme use of names and terms and deviations of names and terms. Take every fantasy book with super-odd names, pull all the names therefrom and throw it in a pot... and the result is this series. It only gets worse as the story goes along... to the point that the English-speaking audience tends to lose track of who is what and what position they hold and what is going on and who has what responsibility, because it's all just a bunch of jibber-jabber references and titles. After a while my mind simply tuned out the terms and simply focused on the plot itself. Unless one is really into this sort of thing, it's easy to get to the point of not caring what a designation means or how it applies.Major disappointment: the 12th or 13th episode takes the buildup of all the preceding episodes, and pours them together in a quickly-narrated climax significantly different from what has gone before. It's like reading a detailed book and then getting to the last chapter, only to find out that chapter is 4 pages long and the author says, \"This is what happened then...\" yada yada yada. After that the plot becomes fairly sparse and iffy and somewhat repetitious.There is a LOT of talking. Dialog is fine, and in most cases the dialog here is fine; it helps tell the story. But there's a LOT of it. Like... a LOT...All put together this had some potential. The story was very creative and imaginative, original and interesting. But at numerous times throughout the series I found myself focusing more on the delivery than the story... and that is never good. A well-crafted story should make you forget you're being told a story. Instead, this series regularly becomes a \"spoken script\" and almost yells \"This is a plot point!\"... which distracts from the immersive experience.So I can only rate less than \"mediocre\" as anime goes. The animation itself isn't that spectacular, many of the characters are underdeveloped and even useless, and the viewer never really connects emotionally with the primary characters or their stories. The ending is an anti-climatic dud. Despite the surprisingly high rating for a large number of viewers, this is an anime that many will find depressing, excessively drawn-out, and containing several weak plot elements that glorify murderers and excuse gross misdeeds in the name of \"good intentions\".The poor, stilted animation doesn't help. The main thing this series has going for it is a creative world, but the character presentation and story doesn't live up to its potential. In the last 4 or 5 episodes it declines into a senseless mini-story, with a final episode that is no more than a yawner summary that fizzles to a disappointing end.",
        "Twelve Kingdoms is an anime based on a book by Ono Fuyumi (sometimes transliterated as Ono Huyumi) that is similar to Vision of Escaflowne or Fushigi Yuugi. It tells the story of Yoko Nakajima a red-haired high school student. On the outside Yoko is popular and kind-hearted but on the inside she is full of doubts and can't express her true feelings. Her teacher wonders if she dyes her hair so her parents want her to dye it black so she will fit in. Yoko has frightening dreams of slaying monsters but her mother brushes them off as nothing to worry about. One day a strange man named Keiki comes to class and warns her of approaching danger. Monsters attack and they flee to the roof where sweethearts Yuka and Asano are chatting. Keiki wants Yoko to take up the sword and go with him to his world. She tries to refuse but when she sees her two classmates in mortal danger she accepts if they can be brought to safety too. They take a trip through a dimensional whirpool and arrive in the world of The Twelve Kingdoms.I've seen the first story arc from episodes 1 to 13 and I understand there should be 39 in the series. The artwork is good and the backgrounds are detailed. I am glad the writer doesn't ignore problems like the language barrier when people go to another world and practical issues like getting food or seeing if strangers can be trusted. I understand Media Blasters has gotten the US rights to the series for 2003 but try to get the Japanese language version if you can. If you like stories about an ordinary person who has to grow up to become a hero you will definitely like it.",
        "I couldn't make it through episode 3. The main character is too annoying and whiny. I lost count of how many times she says \"no I can't do it.\" So irritating. Also, the female friend is a big B****. She's like \"this feels like my world\" and \"why can she only use the sword.\" She's such an obnoxious little B****. Would have been great if she was gone in the first few episodes.",
        "Just rewatched it after 15 years - gosh! I took a break in watching anime, okay? ;) -, and even by todays' standards, I think, it's a very good one. It was my favorite back then and it is now still.Yes, the age shows, the art is not as catchy, there are more stills, grand battles portrayed in small perspectives, but still, if you get involved in the world and the story, none of that will matter (the backgrounds, the buildings, the towns, the interiors, the clothes are pretty detailed). It does not have that retro anime look which prevents me rewatching many older shows, the soundtrack is epic and the English dub is acceptable (not as great as English voice talent work these days, but it's ok. You might want to listen this in Japanese.)So about the story. First of all, Twelve Kingdoms is hardcore fantasy, there is not a single mistep in that. No boobies, no panties, no cute girls (nah, that's not true), no yummy foods, no comedy, no laughing, just blood, struggle and suffering, you can be sure about that. It is compensated by large scale world building, epic storytelling, serious dialogs, catharsis and fulfillment; the ending is one of the greatest I have ever seen, every sentence has its own weight supported by the whole story built up until then.There is a huge collection of manga behind it and the main arc is about Youko Nakajima's detailed transformation from schoolgirl to queen. It happens in the first 39 episodes, minus those few in the middle which is about the black kirin, Taiki. (Kirins are mythical animals choosing kings and spiritually connecting with them.) Those episodes can be skipped, but you either won't make it that far or will be so involved, that you won't skip those anyway since those episodes add some more details to the world. (Youko is a bit lost in the beginning, but bear with it, she will become a godess in the end.)What makes it interesting about Youko's journey is first the world which is very detailed, think about historic China, and well thought out with lots of lore. Secondarily and most importantly, the fact that she has to earn the throne twice. Because there is a big difference between getting the title and earning it. First she gets the throne formally and later she becomes worthy of it. \"Because nobody is given anything without responsibility and if they were, that would be wrong.\" as Rakushun points out, who is by far the best character I have ever encountered in any anime or other medium for the matter. (Yes, he is the rat in my avatar and he becomes Youko's best friend and mentor somewhere around episode 6.)In the second part of Youko's adventure there are two other character arcs, not as big than Youko's, but still interesting and deep, just to shake things up a little, and all these arcs culminate nicely at the end, which is episode 39 in fact. (There are six more episodes after that, but those are forgottable.)This is my all time favourite anime. Would be nice to see a real life adaptation, but probably would never happen.",
        "Amazing anime, i'm floored! I love an amazing female lead. Binged the whole thing. Luckily there are 45 eps but i need someone to pick this up and make more. Not just another isekai!! WATCH IT.",
        "First: I'm not an anime fan! I saw these series by a pure accident, simply because there was nothing else to watch on TV. Is it a masterpiece? Nah-h...I hate this word. Is it perfect? Again, by no means. Is it wonderful in spite all it's flaws? Well, here my personal answer is a resounding YE-E-E-E-E-ES! This is not to everyone's taste, mind you.It takes 45 episodes, 25 minutes each, of a true journey, this means the pace might be a bit slow for some. The show is overloaded with details and strange terms, which also may turn off many viewers. The animation, while very beautiful, is a bit lacking in movement department. You can see that for some seconds the picture stays still with only characters's mouth moving and many body movements are awkward and unintentionally ridiculous. The story is, actually, just a fairy tale, which may turn off another part of the public and as for the anime/fantasy fans - the story sounds a bit too familiar and banal.A young girl in modern Japan, Youko, suddenly finds out she actually belongs to another mysterious world, very reminiscent of ancient China, and some weird stranger takes her there, against her wish, apparently, to find her destiny. Which, of course, must be something special, because, why else this stranger named Keiki who commands some ferocious beasts, kneels before her and declares her to be his master? Yes, you've heard it hundreds times before and, definitely, will hear it another gazillion times - an ordinary man/woman finds out he's the chosen one who can save the world or whatever...bla-bla-bla...Matrix? Star wars? Lord of the Rings? Millions other versions?Well, it's all the same all over again, i thought.Well, yes and no. The \"chosen one\" here is a an insecure (and not in particularly sympathetic way)ordinary teenage-girl. She's a mumbling conformist of a worst kind, the one who's desperate to please everyone and ultimately fails on every level. Seemingly popular and \"accepted\" among her school friends, she's actually despised and used by everyone as a convenient mean to patch every uncomfortable hole. Youko will swallow every insult, hidden or open, will berry her head under the sand even before her parents, will do everything just to remain \"a good girl\" in the eyes of the others. I won't tell you how exactly the things will flow from here on, and, yes, you can guess the general direction, but words can't describe the overall beauty of the wonderful, unpredictable (yes, i MEAN it) and very complicated storyline and fully realistic, flawed and human characters, which develop all along the series, coming a full circle of growth along with the viewer... There's no triumphant endings, cheering crowds, big battles and sieges for 20 minutes each (well, there are some, but it's a relatively small part of the story). The ending is quiet and the whole feeling of the conclusion is very poignant, bitter-sweet and genuinely touching and rewarding.It's about how life isn't a simple thing and its lessons are harsh and not always clear. And it's only your own responsibility which way to choose. While trying to please people you may take an easier path to became a \"good\" person in other's eyes, but there are things and principles that are worth fighting for, even when the closest to you don't share your opinion. It's about the totally different world, which, at the end, appears to be not that different as it seemed. This is a movie about growing up and becoming a wholesome human being, who's ready to take upon himself not only the rights of grown-up life, but also a heavy load of the responsibilities that come with it and painful sacrifices. Thanks to everyone involved in the production. Even without completing the whole 68 episodes as was planned, it's still a rare gem truly worth your time and money.",
        "Being an avid anime fan I can definitely say that this show has the worst character development I have seen in literally any other series or movies that I've watched, even 0 character development would be better than what most of the main characters are like in Twelve Kingdoms.It seems that the main characters that we see the most of will literally suddenly have a change of personality every time the wind blows, even the most minor of things causes these people to have a complete change of heart, just because someone they have never even met before tells them something, they will instantly trust them, it's as if they can't think for themselves; yes some of them have been thrust into a world they don't know but any rational thinking seems to pass them by until the very end of the show. Even my 14 year old deaf cat could make better decisions than any of these people, none of whom are younger than mid teens, some of whom are over 100!! Not only is it painful to watch such 2D characters, but at least twice there are blocks of about 5 episodes or more in a row which are compiled of about 50% of one of the female characters crying over and over again literally at 2 minute intervals and feeling sorry for themselves, as well as multiple other episodes where this is the case, it's utterly awful to put up with as a viewer and for this reason I almost gave up on the series several times, you may not make it through the first 5 due to this fact. The only good thing about this series is the world setting, which is well detailed, and some of the plot lines are interesting, although sadly due to the fact the author didn't really give closure on some of the best story arcs (the Taiki one is the most obvious and best one that comes to mind), you will be starting to actually get into it a bit and then suddenly we don't ever hear from the characters or plot line again for the rest of the whole show.I was going to give this 4 stars, but after writing a review, I have realised how truly awful 75% of this show was and the fact that it needs to give us closure on some major plot points is extremely annoying (even if the original author hadn't written it, it should have been added as just leaving story lines so open is ridiculously annoying to the viewer), on top of that the outcome was very predictable, so it only really deserves a 3, don't waste your time, this is the most overrated and worst anime I have ever watched.",
        "As an avid anime watcher, The Twelve Kingdoms is easily one of the best I've seen. The plot is incredible and original, the character development is outstanding, the music is gorgeous... even the animation, which looks pretty old at this point, is very charming. I just wish it was finished, it's a shame. Definitely worth giving a watch though!",
        "This is one of the best animes(if not THE best)I have ever experienced! The visuals are astounding. Detail is sharp and beautiful. Realistic, true to life detail and color when appropriate, yet vibrant and fantastic when necessary. Run-down villages look dusty and gritty along with the people who inhabit them. Miraculous landscapes, skyscapes, palaces etc. are lush with color and striking in design. The story is very deep, and this may turn off some people. The political and social structure of the society of the Twelve Kingdoms is covered in minute detail. I personally enjoyed this level of description, but if it becomes too much for you, just sit back and let it wash over you because the series (45 episodes) provides so much to enjoy (there is even one episode that is dedicated solely to the workings of the government and society so people can get up to speed should they get lost in all of it). Character growth, development and resolution is at the heart of this story. Definitely a show for those who enjoy conflict of philosophies and ideologies and politics. No outrageously busty half-naked anime chicks here. No wildly unbelievable Dragon Ball Z-type fighting. No too ambiguous Serial Experiments Lain-style plot lines with questionable endings. You will get female characters who are strong and seem like(get this)real people!! You will get mostly realistic combat sequences with a touch of the fantastic from time to time. You will get plot lines that actually go somewhere that will make you angry, sad, happy and even feel vindicated at times. Music should not be ignored either. At moments it is hypnotically beautiful. Music is used subtly and the best way to enjoy it is to pick up the soundtrack CDs. Music is airy and dreamlike using mostly strings and wind instruments. It fits the series perfectly, fantasy music with a slight Eastern edge to it. This anime should be a lot more popular than it is. If you see the DVDs, pick them up now!!",
        "This series is totally unbearable. I am on 7th episode and still I am clueless about what's the whole point. We get it the main villain will be the main character herself and someone will pull her out of darkness, but to be honest that could have been told in a language anyone can get, like the terms being used are just too irritating for the English audience. To be honest I don't think even Japanese audience would have liked it let alone western.",
        "Youko Nakagima's story begins simply enough when a strange blond man called Keiki tells her \"I swear never to desert my post before your throne,\" and asks her to accept this.

Wisked away to another world, bereft of all protection except a sword and a skill-giving spirit called a hinman, Youko struggles to survive in a kingdom hostile to her very existence. Tormented by a taunting spirit monkey, Youko has difficulty even maintaining her sanity. She wonders what has become of Keiki, who seems to have deserted her, and if she will ever encounter anyone from her new world who is friendly to her.The story of Shouryuu the King of En and the thus far incomplete story of the black kirin Taiki are also included in this 45 episode series.",

Can a person who is morally righteous and good be at the same time incompetent in leadership?One of the many strengths of Juuni Kokki is how it spends much of its time answering these questions. Throughout the show, these questions are not only addressed, but are tackled with exuberance. The end result is a philosophical commentary that is unexpectedly perceptive and interesting in its analysis.Another major point in Juuni Kokki's favor lies in its absolutely fantastic character development. At the beginning of the show, Youko (no, not \"Yoko\" like many people here are spelling it) is almost irritatingly pathetic. Self-centered and vulnerable, one has trouble finding any redeeming characteristics whatsoever. Gradually, however, this changes completely. By the end of the show, Youko has transformed into a wonderful human being, a person qualified to rule an entire country. Other characters, as well, undergo a similar metamorphosis. Though initially selfish, unworthy and detestable, all of them are eventually tempered into superior beings. Seeing these characters find their courage, wisdom and morality in the face of overwhelming adversity is one of the most rewarding processes that I have ever experienced.Finally, there is a lot to be said about Juuni Kokki's overarching storyline. Though the plot initially appears to be very similar to Inu Yasha or Fushigi Yuugi, it soon changes into something completely different from either of the other two. The plot then grows and grows in complexity and depth, and ultimately achieves truly epic proportions. Not since Crest of the Stars have I seen a narrative so satisfyingly intricate and intelligent.Though admittedly not as good as its story and characters, Juuni Kokki's animation and sound are nonetheless quite commendable. The animation hosts a very nice and fluid feel, resembling the animation styles of Record of Lodoss War and 3x3 Eyes. The character designs are all definitely above average; I especially liked Youko's design change early on in the series. In terms of music, the traditional arrangement of violins and wind pipes really works well with the overall mood of the show.In fact, the only perceivable weakness of the anime lies in the fact that it will be a very, very long time before the U.S can see the entirety of the show. Production has ceased at episode 45, and doesn't look like it will continue for some time. However, this is less of a fault then one would think. Episode 39 is a very nice place to stop; nearly all of the plot lines are resolved at that point.Still, whether you decide to watch Juuni Kokki now or later, make SURE that you eventually see it. With its practically unsurpassed storyline and characters, Juuni Kokki stands as one of my favorite animes of all time.",
        "I absolutely lost myself and also found some parts of myself in this anime. Truly brilliant. Only if you love adventures and politics of leadership and beautiful friendships. Check it out man.. be your own self.",
        "After i bought anime series like inuyasha, witch hunter robin and cowboy bebop and watched a few others on TV, by fluke i stumbled upon twelve kingdoms anime series. while cowboy bebop is a classic, twelve kingdoms it is the best anime i have seen so far. i was so sad when 45th episode rolled around. i was so addicted and just wanted more. needles to say i watched for 3 straight days and nights since i just could not stop. could compare to lord of the rings. not sure why marketing people don't advertise this type of quality of anime to a wider audience. it is a gem and i am sure all those hordes of lord of the rings fans would swallow this one as well.",
        "Not having the eloquence of some of the previous posters here I'll just say that this anime series is an absolute pleasure to watch.I don't mind a bit of excitement as long as it enhances a story eg Vampire Hunter D Two is a top action anime with a nice touch of gore (grin). But that doesn't mean I don't appreciate the quieter things in anime as well.The animation in 12 Kingdoms may be a bit simple in parts where a large number of people/creatures are involved or in cityscapes which tend to be somewhat empty looking but that is easily forgiven with the overall quality of the story. In addition when there are only a limited amount of characters present the drawing is quite attractive.The series has a very strong storyline with excellent moral values and character development. It has been a real wrench to have to end a viewing session on some occasions.That there is a female heroine in the early stages is also great. My daughter is wrapped in the series and quite miffed to be limited to 2 episodes a day! I'd easily put this in the top 5 anime I have seen.",
        "The Twelve Kingdoms features many of the trappings of epic fantasy: a complex fantastic realm with plenty of back-story, powerful monsters, and spectacular sword duels. But at its heart The Twelve Kingdoms is really a wonderful study of how seemingly worthless people can be tempered by severe hardship into people of great character; from people you would avoid to people you would be happy to call friend. I actually felt like a better person when I finished it; not a feeling I normally get from watching anime.But you should know a few things before you get into this excellent show: It features four separate story arcs, and only two of them actually involve the main protagonist Yuoko. I highly recommend new viewers only watch episodes 1-13 and 22-40; my five-star rating pertains primarily to just those episodes. The episodes in-between tell an unfinished and unrelated story, and are likely to leave viewers feeling frustrated. Episodes 14 and 21 are unimportant \"recap\" episodes I'd only recommend watching if you still feel confused after watching the first 13.The first few episodes (1-5 and 22-29) of these story arcs can be tiresome, as the protagonists start as annoying, whiny characters; but I urge everyone to \"stick with it\" and keep watching as the payoff at the end is certainly worth it: Twelve Kingdoms features one of the best endings I've ever seen (at episode 39). It's important for us to see these characters as annoying and somewhat pathetic so that we fully appreciate the strong, self-aware people they become in the end. For this reason re-watching the series is a special treat; I recommend watching it again at least once.The setting of The Twelve Kingdoms is complex and the myriad of special terms may put some people off; but I would again urge people to be patient; Yuoko generally knows less than us, and her lack of understanding is important to the story, so a bit of confusion on our part helps us to empathize with her.Finally, I'd recommend watching the Japanese audio with English subtitles if you can stand to do so. Yuoko's voice is much more expressive on the Japanese track and features noticeable changes in tone that reflect and highlight the changes in her attitude as the story progresses. However, most of the other English voice-overs are actually fairly good.Twelve Kingdoms is from 2002 and so the quality of the animation, while good, isn't quite up to par with modern animes like Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit. There is no sexual content of any kind (and although some characters are depicted taking baths, nothing racy is seen), and almost no romantic content whatsoever. There is no gore, almost no blood shown, and most deaths occur off-screen. While many episodes feature exciting and well done action, fighting isn't quite the focus of The Twelve Kingdoms and the entire first half of the third arc (episodes 22-32) features almost no action at all. Although the content is probably safe for kids, I can't imagine any kids being able to follow the complex plot, or deal with the intense emotions portrayed within. Twelve Kingdoms isn't tame for the sake of a PG rating; it simply understands its focus is storytelling and therefore doesn't need to delve into sex or violence to make for a truly entertaining experience."

        "Set on a desert planet sometime in the distant future 'Trigun' follows the escapades of Vash the Stampede; a man considered so dangerous there is a $$60,000,000,000 reward for his capture. Searching for him are insurance agents Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson; they find him in the opening episode but don't believe the man they found could he the infamous killer nicknamed 'The Human Typhoon' due to the trail of destruction he leaves behind. It quickly becomes apparent that while Vash may attract trouble he does everything he can to avoid hurting anybody\u0085 even those who want to kill him. As the series progresses we learn more about Vash; he isn't the idiot he first appears to be; he is tormented by something that happened in the distant past and determined to confront his nemesis\u0085 his brother!Trigun is definitely a classic anime series; I'd heard of 'Vash the Stampede' before I started watching anime and long before I finally caught up with the series. I'm glad I finally caught up with it as it deserves its status. There is plenty of action and in the early episode there are plenty of laughs. The early humour serves to amplify the pain when we learn more about Vash's past. The desert setting gives it a western feel but that changes to Sci-fi when we see how everybody came to be on the planet. There is also the mystery as to just who, and just as importantly what, Vash and his brother are. The other characters are fun too; especially Meryl, Milly and the gun-toting priest Nicolas D. Wolfwood. The character designs may look dated compared to more modern series but that isn't a problem; they are at least distinctive.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "\"Trigun\", despite not having an incredible level of animation, it's a very good anime series, with a great story, and many interesting characters.Which starts as a crazy homage/parody to the Western movie genre (With some elements of fantasy and science fiction) quickly evolves into something way more complex and dramatic, exploring the past of the characters, and showing how they are somewhat connected.A very good element form this series is that plot advances in a fast (But never confusing, or muddled) way, moving from the episodic format into a continuing storyline. The changes from comedy to drama are never gratuitous or forced, and this series even manages to keep some glimpses of humor in the most serious episodes.The best element of \"Trigun\" are the characters:Both the heroes and villains, each one of them are very charismatic and interesting, avoiding most of the most annoying anime clich\u00e9s.\"Trigun\" it's a pretty satisfying series, combining the best elements form different genres (Such as Western, Comedy, science fiction, drama and action) being one of my favorite anime series.9/10",
        "I never really expected to see a hero that looks tough but turns out to be an utter complete eejit and really a perv lol. Seriously though, the main characters were brillant. I love how Milly is the like the postive naive girl and Meryll is the smart who always gets peed off by Vast's antics! I loved the intro to this anime as well, the electric guitar is sick man! Seriously some 90s anime can do their opening intro pretty well!Loved the silly humour, the background setting that its a western, the characters and the mindblowing ending where Vast kills his psychopathic twin bro lol! 8/10 it deserves!",
        "Plot paragraph copied from existing review:Vash the Stampede is a wanted man. Nicknamed the \"Humanoid Typhoon,\" he brings destruction to any town he passes through. Because of this, a $$60 billion bounty has been put on his head. The Bernardelli Insurance Agency has also dispatched two of its agents, Meryl Strife and Milly Thompson, to find Vash and report on why he causes every town that he passes through to be utterly destroyed.What they find is that the Humanoid Typhoon isn't quite what he seems. If one wants to be blunt, Vash is more or less a dork. He has a very strong aversion to taking another human life, instilled in him as a boy by his guardian Rem. Though he is an exceptional gunslinger, Vash would rather roam from town to town spreading the message of \"Love and Peace!\". Unfortunately, many bounty hunters are motivated by the immense bounty on Vash's head, and it is the battles between Vash and these bounty hunters that destroy every town Vash comes to.Along the way, we meet a motley band of characters, most notable among them being the gunslinging preacher Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who has an unholy surprise in the cross he carries on his back, and Legato, the one man that Vash seems to actually fear. Ultimately, it is a man named Knives Millions that Vash seeks. Who is Knives, what is his connection to Vash, and why does Vash want to find him so badly?This anime was very fun to watch I really enjoyed every bit of it.The characters were well written to keep the viewer engaged.The intro and ending was good too.Johnny Yong Bosch for his first anime role was excellent and so was the rest of the cast for an early anime dub.If you are an old school anime fan I would definitely recommend it especially if you are into stuff like Cowboy Bebop.",
        "In my opinion, Trigun is the best action anime series I've seen to this date. I mean, it's so wonderful, exciting, hilarious and above all, action-packed to the core: which is what an anime of this genre needs to be. Tonal shifts are not easy to handle, especially in TV shows, but the makers of Trigun emerge successful in their attempt; the first half of the series is an action comedy while the other half is serious action. The way the whole tone slowly changes without feeling abrupt or unnecessary is really impressive.First off, if you have a Netflix subscription but the lack of Japanese audio is bothering you, don't worry! The English dub is absolutely fine and even suits to the show's Western-style backdrop. After a point of time, you won't even realize you're watching a dubbed version. Vash the Stampede is one of the greatest action heroes, anime and live-action both considered. The moment you know he's a professional but also has a no-kill policy, you know it's also going to be lighter in terms of tone. Well, that's maintained for almost half of the series where the action leaves you breathless and the comedy makes you laugh out loud.In the second half, the tone becomes almost completely serious and the action becomes more intense, which indeed works because by that time, the story has already started coming to a finale. That being said, the final episode is explosive and has some of the finest fighting you'll ever see in an anime. And yeah, aside from Vash, Wolfwood, Meryl and Milly are equally important, lovable and memorable characters. The way Vash always appears so cool, confident and fun despite the hardness and harshness around him, comes off as a really positive and inspiring character trait.If you too are just starting to get into anime and want a good recommendation, Trigun is strongly recommended from my side. Although it has some gore and infrequent strong language, it's overall the kind of show even young action anime buffs can enjoy. As for me, I'm looking forward to check out Trigun: Badlands Rumble soon.",
        "On a desert planet in a far future lives a guns man named Vash the Stampede. He's feared and seen as a murder by all individuals alike. He gain the nickname \"Humanoid Typhoon\" because he brings disaster to wherever he goes. After demolishing a city, a bounty was placed on his head $$60 billion. Two insurance girls(Meryl and Milly) were hired to locate and keep an eye on Vash to insure the damages that occur around him. At first they don't know what Vash is really like. But eventually they'll learn that he's the one guy you'd least suspect to be a wanted criminal.Throughout the whole series, you'll learn about the past, personality, and tragedy of Vash. As well seeing many interesting minor, secondary, and vile characters that surround him. Not to mention the dozens of \"Wild West\" themed towns on the desert plant they all live on.Trigun is one of the common 26 episode TV anime. But it's indeed one of the best ones out there. The animation is well done, for it being made back when Anime is still done with original cell animation. The western/punk look makes it stand out more than the other series. The story is really unique. It's also well balances in drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi.Those who like Lupin III and Cowboy Bebop will indeed admire Trigun as well.",
        "I've met otaku who are pretty picky about the choice of anime that land on their must-watch list, and surprise, surprise, there are people who refuse to watch mecha, people who refuse to watch slice-of-life, and there are people who refuse to watch anything which doesn't look like anime as they know it. So you'll see people shunning RWBY, Ping Pong the Animation, even Flowers of Evil, but let's put those titles aside for a minute; and focus our attention on anime that aired before 2000. Back in the day, art styles were different, animation was tightly budgeted and unpolished, so it's a jarring contrast when juxtaposed against the shine and sparkle of anime that come out today, and it's hard not to cringe when one's first impression of an anime is its aged feel and look. But hey, there are people today who still dare to say things like, \"Meh, Death Note versus Code Geass? Has anyone actually seen Legend of the Galactic Heroes?\" And that should tell us a little something; that there are shows which are so good for what they are, that to gloss over them in favour of better visuals would be nothing less than pure travesty.You know where I'm going with this. Trigun is a classic. I didn't expect it to be, but it's always nice when you're proven wrong. At this point, I'm going to gently tell you that the way to get the best out of this show, is to know that it's a story about cowboys having showdowns in the wastelands, and just watch it. Watch it, and even when you feel like giving up, push yourself past episode 7, and if you're the least bit intrigued by this point, then push yourself past episode 9, and if you get to episode 17 then you're probably set to finish the rest of the story on a good note.Still not convinced? Okay then, maybe a sprinkle of spoilers may be necessary. So Trigun tells the story of a reputably destructive and outlawed gunman called Vash the Stampede, who roams the barren wastelands with a .45 calibre revolver in his pocket and a $$60 billion bounty on his head. Entire villages are paranoid at the very mention of his name, and for good reason too, as the legendary outlaw leaves a trail of blazing destruction in his wake. Implicated in all this chaos is the Bernadelli Insurance Society, which sends two of its staff, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, to track down Vash and to ensure that he ceases causing the damage that is crippling their company. However, they're not the only ones hot on his trail, for the widespread poverty and corruption that inflicts villages across the desert, mean that there are others on the hunt for the bounty on Vash's head. And with that, here's the second chance for you to close this window and watch the first episode with all immediacy. You can come back later and read the rest of this 'review'.Trigun's opening episode is one of the most well-written openings I have come across, and while the writing for the rest of the series isn't as consistently good as this, it at least sets the stage for a recurring trope that occurs throughout the plot - the element of subversion. In Trigun, there's this unspoken rule that what you see is never, ever what you get, and it keeps the entire story doused in a very healthy coating of mystery and suspense. You might think that you're dealing with an episodic adventure series which constantly reuses the who-can-pull-out-his-gun-faster plot device, but no, be warned, it's not like that. You might think you understand the settings and background of this whole story, but no, you really don't. This is your third chance to close the window and go watch Trigun's first episode. There will be no more chances after this.Honestly, there's only one thing about the entirety of Trigun which has to hook you - the character of Vash the Stampede. If you decide that you like him, the rest of the series should be a breeze; if you can't see where the whole show is going with him as a main character, then give up, Trigun is not for you, because even the crowd's alternative fan favourite, Wolfwood, only shows up a little later. But on a personal note, I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't fall in love with Vash at first sight. To begin with, his character design - which encompasses everything from his blond Mohawk, to his mole, to the red trenchcoat - is iconic. Even Edward Elric looks tame compared to him. Appearance aside, everything about him drives the show, and this is what I love so much about Trigun. Vash starts out as a hopeless schizophrenic to the audience; he's incredibly serious one moment, and completely possessed by the ghost of a five-year old the next. In the first few episodes, he goofs his way through dodging bullets, and we (or myself, at least) are conned into thinking that this supernatural ability is a running gag of sorts. But like I warned you, don't be fooled; you think you know better, but you don't.More importantly, Vash, like another classic anime icon Kenshin Himura, goes by the philosophy that one must never take the life of another, no matter how one can justify it. What's so phenomenal about Trigun, is that Vash doesn't spout his creed in a vacuum, if anything, countless lives are lost precisely because he chooses to stick to his guns (pun not intended), and he winds up losing a lot of friends along the way. What it shows us is the price of morals; like Kenzo Tenma from Naoki Urasawa's Monster, Vash is repeatedly tormented and haunted by the sacrifices his philosophy forces him to make. He's no Kenshin in the sense that he doesn't renounce a treacherous past; rather, he starts out haplessly idealistic, spurned by nothing more than a deep influence from the mother figure in his distant childhood, a young woman named Rem. Through all the antics and slapstick comedy, he's stubbornly committed to seeing the very best in humanity, despite all the pain people have put him through - I mean, there's a reason why Brad is a dead-ringer for Steve, okay? I've seen people dish dirt on his character for being 'boring' and annoyingly moral, and to that I say 'haters back off!', since if you're looking for mindless killing then go watch Hellsing Ultimate or Attack on Titan - Trigun is not about satisfying fantasy pleasures about action and violence, and in truth it's quite the opposite.Trigun is a story about the age old moral quandary about whether the ends can justify the means, and while Vash sits on one end of the spectrum, settled right at the end of the other is none other than the motorcycle-riding, crucifix-slinging priest, Nicholas D Wolfwood. A priest, right? Well ha, ha, ha, I can't imagine how people suck up to him instead, when he's even bigger of a hypocrite than Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass. For someone who goes around with a dollhouse church for performing confessionals, Wolfwood is absolutely liberal about taking the lives of others, and scorns Vash's pacifism as idealistic and reckless. Sure, his weapon the Punisher is a daring hunk of metal that has never really since been replicated in anime lore, but coolness aside, Wolfwood is a very conflicted man, and the fact that he and Vash seem (for the most part) to click like brothers-from-another-mother is almost a miracle. Do I like Wolfwood? I like his characterisation, sure, but I've always inclined myself towards Vash's type of ideals. I know lots of people adore him, though, so who knows!Meryl and Milly, the insurance girls, serve as the story's supporting characters, and while I really like them, I have an issue with the fact that they seem to merely exist for comic relief, a dash of waifu-ism, and pretty much nothing else. They bear no significance to the overarching conspiracies, and are at best characters who initially guide and reinforce the first impressions of Trigun which the audience is supposed to hold, particularly with respect to the nature of the wanted criminal Vash the Stampede. After this, it's mostly their relationships with Vash and Wolfwood which continue to keep them interesting, for the meat of the story is something that only Vash is truly connected to...and Wolfwood to a much lesser extent.A final character mention will be made of the series' main villain. After thinking about it over and over again, I've come to the conclusion that Knives is probably replacing Monster's Johan Liebert as my new favourite villain. This is entirely personal, so I'm not really looking to justify it. But granted, there's nothing comparatively charismatic nor alluring about Knives, so why, you ask? Well, considering the amount of actual screentime he actually gets, he's a highly anticipated character when he actually makes an appearance - and that speaks volumes of his subtle presence in the show. Beyond this, I'm deeply intrigued by his backstory, and the way he came to be who he is, despite growing up as a practical clone of his saintly twin brother. It's convincing, it's believable, it's very emotional - it's encapsulated in the metaphorical image of the spider and the butterfly, and that is all that needs to be said. Want to find out more? Go watch Trigun.So yeah, if you haven't already guessed, the characters drive the plot, simply because their contrasting philosophies make the show what it is. And that's so important, mainly due to the fact that there is no way Trigun would have counted as a classic by virtue of its action scenes. Let's be honest here, it is often glaringly obvious that Trigun was done on an airtight budget. In order to bring out the desolateness and emptiness of the wastelands, the colours used for the backgrounds are drab and boring. The character designs are pretty good, though even the most outrageous villains pale in comparison to Vash. But oh my word, the animation is occasionally mediocre at best - because while there are pretty intense gunfights and spectacular GIF-worthy scenes of Vash pulling the cutest baka faces, there are other moments where characters speak despite their mouths not moving.",
        "Based on the manga of the same name by Yasuhiro Nightow, Trigun follows Vash the Stampede, a gun slinging outlaw on the run in a far futuristic wild west wasteland with a 60 billion double dollar bounty on his head. Followed close at heel by Meryl and Milly, two representatives from Bernardelli Insurance Agency tracking Vash as he seems to cause exorbitant amounts of damage wherever he's reported seen. What starts as a quite good, fun anime eventually turns into a bit of a slog as we get multiple recap episodes, questionable animation, and unforeseen world building as the narrative goes further and further into the mythology its created. Towards the end I wasn't near as interested as the beginning, its overarching plot follows a thread not that dissimilar to the recently reviewed Ergo Proxy (which I would highly recommend), but the lore goes too big too fast, with ironically too much inconsequential filler plot in between to make the grand scale of it all feel impactful. I liked all the characters and aesthetics. The futuristic steam punk western kinda vibe was cool and overall I had fun. Created the same year as Yu-gi-oh and Cowboy Bebop, this series fits very well in between the two in most aspects. Character design is right out of Yu-gi-oh while the world and plot are Bebop-ish, the series had big shoes to fill standing next to those giants of anime. I can understand how some love this, it was certainly pretty good for its time.",
        "This is the best anime ever put together. It has epic story lines to go along with a killer soundtrack with incredible voice work and action.The Action is great, it deals with Vash the Stampede and in the first few episodes it leaves you guessing, if you do not watch the intro, who the heck is this guy....but as it progresses you see a budding deep storyline driven action comedy drama with deep philosophical meaning with an intense rock soundtrack.THis is THE BEST ANIMATION EVER MADE! Trigun deals with deeper meanings, from to kill or not to, is it wrong, what is right and what is wrong.....forgive or not to......It's everything that makes watching TV/Movies/Comics good and important.See this otherwise the Humanoid Typhoon will come for you.",
        "The anime series Trigun takes place on a deserted planet in the near future. Terrible tales are told about the Bountyhunter Vash, but the truth is that Vash is very different from what rumor has it.\"Trigun\" didn't convince me at all at first.In the first few episodes, you only see the main character wandering around different cities and fooling around while two women from an insurance company follow him, who are supposed to keep an eye on him.But from ~episode 5 Trigun gets much better. The adventures experienced by the main character are much more exciting, the character gets more depth and the story is also more exciting.",
        "Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson of the Bernadelli Insurance Company have a problem. They are to contain the problem of Vash \"The Stampede\", also known as \"The Humanoid Typhoon\". Every city that he stops in finds itself utterly destroyed. The problem is, once they find Vash, they also find that he's never killed a person and appears to be a bumbling idealistic fool which a penchant for dodging bullets and eating donuts. At least that's what he appears to be.In a strange twist on anime protagonists, Vash is not a dark brooder or a naive boy with skill. Although he has elements of a dark past and such, he's an idealist committed to \"love and peace\" and he never shoots to kill, but rather uses his gun and his impossible marksmanship as a tool. While the series begins with a strong comic tone, serious elements are placed in the undercurrent and as the series progresses, the tone becomes increasingly serious with the comedy becoming more like breaks between the intense story. Towards the end of the series, it becomes increasingly potent, resonating both with emotions and intellect.I really like the way the series really grapples with questions of idealism, pragmatism, questions of morality regarding the ends and means and other philosophical concepts, each having some embodiment in the various characters of the show. All the same, the characters are not allegories, but just strongly aligned to certain kinds of thinking. I do wish that some of the other characters were fleshed out more, but I also realize that it's hard to devote so much time to characters in a 24-episode arc.Trigun is a surprisingly superb piece of storytelling thrown in a fantastic animated world and while the earlier comic episodes might be a little loose, they set the ground for the more serious second half and no episode seems utterly unnecessary. An excellent series and highly recommended to those who love science fiction, strong serial storytelling or those who love animation. 9/10",
        "A lot of people have been comparing this to Cowboy Bebop. While Vash may contrast an idealistic view on the world with Spike's cynical, sarcastic personality, I still liked them both. They were great western series from the 90s that should stand the test of time.I don't really like half of the anime from the 90s that focused on psychological elements even though many people called it the best decade for anime, there were still a few that came out that I liked. But this and Cowboy Bebop were the best one.This anime is about a guy who has caused destruction in July City which gives him the 60 billion double dollar bounty on his head. Almost everyone hates him and wants to catch him. But Vash is actually an innocent guy who has never did anything wrong. Vash and Wolfwood are funny, kind male characters with their strengths and weaknesses and I liked their relationship.Now, the other characters such as the Insurance girls are kind of typical anime characters. Milly is sometimes stupid and Meryl is a tsundere who is in love with Vash, so I don't really care much for them. They're mediocre, I guess. A few of the more minor characters are able to grow on me such as Jessica, or have likable personalities such as Rem.The villains are eh... not that great. They drag down the series and I understand that but I still think they're too evil.The story is action-packed and exciting to watch. Vash may be a little too wise with his never kill moral because what if he's in a situation where he has to defend himself? But he realizes in the end, it's okay to make mistakes. He can cry a little too much but I like that he sympathizes with the suffering.Overall, Trigun is not half-bad. Give it a try, you might be surprised. Even though it did have its flaws that stop it from being an excellent anime, Vash is still one of the best characters in anime history.",
        "Spoilers.Somehow I found the time to watch this entire series within a time span of four days.  Maybe I shouldn't have used the time to...Trigun is as much as can be expected from a series, as well as an anime.  It has the usual big, rough, tough bad guys that the little guy must defeat. Nearly everything is solved with a barrage of massive weaponry.  Although the main character steers clear of killing anybody, the body count still rises, especially toward the end of the series.The drawings are great, but the animation itself is really low.  Motions are choppy and mouths move the same way for any word.  Most anime do that, though.Trigun starts out hilarious, especially the first episode.  Vash the Stampede is a real likeable character, but he is flawed in so many ways.  He is constantly changing his attitude and demeanor, from hungry nerd to wisened, hardened gunslinger to ecstatic, boyish young man.The story to this is actually quite nice, but since it is introduced after half the series is over, the viewers are left completely confused.  The \"Big Bad Guy\" is only seen in two episodes (as his \"ultimate\" form) and the final battle is not very difficult for Vash.  He lacks a decent introduction, and even his lower villains seem to scare me more than he does.Tons of things are left unexplained in this series.  At the end, Knives claims they are plants.  We never learn of their true origins.  It is never explained why Vash has so many personalities.  The angel arms aren't explained.  His ability to outmaneuver bullets is left unexplained.  Their long life span is never explained.  Heck, even the name of the series itself is never explained.Trigun does have its good moments, though.  Some parts are downright hilarious (To Wolfwood:  \"I am known as Valintinez...\").  There are great action sequences.  It's great how one character, in the end, turns to God.But, for the most part, Trigun is like any other anime.  Shallow plotline, crummy ending (if one could call it an ending), great action sequences, and guns, guns, guns.  It's a really funny series, but I wouldn't bother with it too much unless you're really into anime and have a lot of time on your hands.",
        "When I first started working up to become a major otaku, I decided to try out Trigun.  This show gives me mixed feelings, depending on the episodes it features.Now the first episodes(about 1-10) are some of my favorites, introducing Vash, Meryl, Milly, and my personal favorite, Wolfwood.  They wind up facing a whole bunch of different thugs, with some real zany, laugh out loud silliness to go with the excellent action.But in episode 12, which introduces Legato and Monev the Gale, it all changes.  The show goes from an action-comedy series to a serious, and sometimes depressing show.  Granted, there are still some humorous scenes, but they didn't really get to me like the early episodes did.Episodes 23 and 24 were the clincher.  I really hated these ones, so much in fact that I even went to say that I hated everything about Trigun for a while.  While I'm no longer anti-Vash, I don't like the second half of the show much.BOTTOM LINE:  I'm content with the early episodes. I try not to think about the later ones as much as I can, especially episode 23.",
        "This anime was too childish. Taking the godly Cowboy Bebop as a comparison, Trigun acts far too whimsical and doesn't take itself serious constantly in order to keep a straight mentality, and lead the viewer to keep the respectability he should have for the main character, Vash, or any other character for that matter. At times the series attempts to try something new, and doesn't go back to the roots of an anime, with big eyes, and goofily embarrassed red races, but the show regresses as it is watched more, and its integrity is lost in the process. The problem with the American version is the voice acting is terrible. The characters are far too immature sounding to be believable, and when the viewer is supposed to believe Vash can pick targets off from 500 yards out, but can't sound like at any minute his voice is going to crack, more respect is lost through the cracks of the show yet again.Unfortunately, the show will never be as good as many of the others out there, but if some people want to believe in it's decency, it's their choice. I on the other hand find Trigun to be very lacklustre, and lacking in an overall \"wow\" appeal that all animes should have. Decent for a few episodes, I don't recommend sitting through an entire series of this show.Final Judgement: There are better animes out there-- watch them instead.Scott",
        "The animation is good not great, the designs and the western ambiance are perfect but you feel the budget, a lot of time there's still frames during dialogue and there's not a detail in wide shots.I think the budget all went into the music, it's amazing. The music match perfectly the futuristic western ambiance in the instrument and it's a lot of fun.The characters are great, the mystery and morality surrounding Vash is amazing, Meryl and Milly are very likeable and Wolfwood is one of the coolest characters of fiction. Knives makes the show amazing, the storyline he brings is amazing.Before the arrival of Knives, the show felt very episodic and a lot of it felt like filler with a few great episodes, which isn't great in a 26 episode show.",
        "A lot of animes set people off. Slow beginnings, long series, and lack of substance make a lot of anime shows completely unwatchable to the newcomer.Those animes should take a lesson from Trigun. If there was ever an anime that told a story best in 26 episodes, it's definitely this one. Vash The Stampede, a supposed outlaw with a $$60 million reward, must set out to find where his life started and how to go on now. On his journey he is tagged along by reporters Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, and is later accompanied by the gun-toting priest Nicholas D. Wolfwood.Every episode has its own wonderful story and solves a little more of the mystery of Vash's life, always wanting you hungering for more but feeding you enough to love that episode just as much as any other. I, for one, was very able to connect to the characters as each has their own colorful and lovable personality. It brought a lot of life to an anime series that you aren't treated to often.There's no way you can't enjoy Trigun - it's an anime series for all and definitely one that will last throughout anime history as one of the best. It may not be glittered with massive CG and high-budget animation, but that's not what is important. If you haven't seen this yet, go see it now.",
        "The OG Trigun is an outstanding anime, even if it is borrowing heavily from the plotline, structure, and characterizations of Rurouni Kenshin. It's well acted, well animated, well written, with just oodles of iconic characters and moments. There's enough comedy and action for everyone. If you're an anime fan, it's pretty much a mandatory viewing experience.My one complaint, and the reason I can't give it a 10/10 is erratic pacing. The general framework breaks into sections, the first being sort of a 'getting to know you' phase where Vash, the Insurance Girls, and Wolfwood are introduced, and there's a little ongoing confusion about who Vash really is. The show does SORT OF try to deceive the audience but ... he's also right there in the title sequence, so they don't try very hard.Then the main plot slowly starts creeping in. We starts to meet some of the 'demons', and we start getting flashbacks. This is where the pacing gets to be a problem. While telling the background slowly over time was probably a good idea, the show delivers little bits of flashback that aren't terribly informative, repeats them liberally, and then takes a couple episodes off from the main plot in order to just shoehorn in the backstory. This mixture didn't work for me.But generally speaking, the show's so good in so many other ways, I can't complain.",
        "Trigun is great anime cool fights cool gun fights it is something you dont want to miss",
        "The series first reels you in as a hilarious, action-packed romp full of wit and comical chaos, with a pretty clever premise behind it. But as the episodes progress, a more complex mystery begins to unfold and you'll find yourself dying to find out what's next when you're not laughing your head off or marveling at the action scenes. Crisp animation and chara designs, clever humour, a solid storyline and likeable characters that grow on you make Trigun a highly recommended series. Watching Trigun is not just very entertaining, it also leaves a lasting impression. Long live \"Love and Peace\"!",
        "\"Trigun\" takes place on a desert planet which sort of resembles the wild west, except with little pieces of modern technology scattered throughout-not to mention tidbits of \"lost technology\" nobody seems to know how to use. Feared throughout the towns is Vash The Stampede...a mysterious individual who leaves destruction in his wake and who has amassed a $$60 million reward on his head(That extra $ isn't a typo). Yet anybody who meets the fellow will utterly be shocked by the kind-hearted, hyperactive oaf he appears to be...or is he? Trigun is among the best of the latest anime batch from Japan. The character of Vash brings back memories of Monkey Punch's take on Lupin III, and also those who've been looking for an animated western that isn't dumbed down for kids, this is it. Although the series might seem like an episodic series of adventures at first, like most anime series there's more than there appears to be lurking underneath the surface. The animation quality is also very good, with bright, vibrant colors and a real polished look. A fun and exciting series, highly recommended.",
        "Seriously this is such a good series.\nReally liked it on so many levels.\nI cant wait to forget it enough to re watch again.",
        "Pros:\nGood story\nWell placed comedy\nCharacter development\nMeh:\nGraphics\nSo much death\nCon:\nA lot left unexplained.For a series from the late 90s, this has sure held up well. The graphics do not compare to today's artistry, but that really does not get in the way. Instead, we have a story that starts off with humor and ends with some seriousness, yet keeping the same pleasantness from beginning to end.A lot of the story isn't explained, and that does leave you wanting. Similarly, a lot of the incidents that force the story to progress make no sense if you actually think about them. Nonetheless, the progression is there, and that really is all that matters. Most fights make no sense either, but they are fun nonetheless, especially when they \"explain\" them.The good guys and bad guys are clearly defined. The good guys are easily relatable. The bad guys are despicable. It's an easy watch.The show does technically cover a deep idea or two, but unless you want to think about them, it's a simple story with comedy and action. I found it surprisingly enjoyable to watch. If you're looking for a good anime, i would recommend adding this to the list.",
        "Warning: May contain minor spoilers.On the planet Gunsmoke there is a man whose named is feared above all others. He destroyed the entire city of July by himself and yet no one died. They call him the Humanoid Typhoon and the 60,000,000,000$$ Man.  He is Vash the Stampede.But the thing is, Vash really doesn't live up to his press. He's not the heartless monster of story. He's really...well, a great big goofball.Thus is the hero of Trigun, the story of a man seeking to bury his past and spread \"Love and Peace!\" Joining Vash in his travels are the Insurance Girls, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, whose job it is to try and limit the damage of any Vash-related incidents, and wondering priest Nicholes D. Wolfwood who has more than his share of secrets.Along the way Vash mets many interesting people in a variety of situations and does what he can to help them, often in unexpected ways. The show starts off pretty funny but as time goes by a darker picture begins to emerge. Someone is after Vash. And this guy has assembled a team of the most deadly people on the planet and sent them after our hero. Led the by the psychic psycho Legato Bluesummers, the Gung-Ho Guns crave a path of dead and destruction right toward Vash. To put an end to the madness Vash must confront his darkest memories and decide not only who he is but what his is.All in all, Trigun is fantastic anime that feature remarkable characters, a compelling story, good music and loads of cool ideas. A real must-see for anyone who calls themselves an anime fan.",
        "You know, I really really liked the first five or six episodes of this show. They were amusing and didn't really need so much thought put into them. Hey call me a moron, call me an idiot, but when I want to watch CARTOONS (yes, anime is cartoons get over it) I want to giggle at silliness and enjoy it without thinking too damn much. Back to it, the first six episodes were funny, amusing and I didn't need to think about anything. Pure enjoyment, then they started adding in more plot and I got confused (hey I get confused easily) and it all starts to become unbearably boring and just not entertaining to ANY degree. So in other words I gotta give this one a thumbs down. 4/10... but if it was just six episodes i'd get probably a 7/10 uh.. i don't know where I'm going with this so goodbye."

    "Black Butler": [
        "An okay drama, with interesting small cases and beautiful art. Actually, the art was really good, as the whole universe of the anime was impressive, full with details. The action scenes, especially, were really good and nicely drawn. The small cases, in addition, kept the interest high and provided entertainment, as the main story wasn't strong enough to support the whole season. Also, the characters were pretty interesting, especially Ciel, who was charming and complex, which added some spice to the story. Again, however, the main story was so so and in the end, it was just to crazy to take charge.",
        "So I've heard of Black Butler from the YouTuber \"Akidearest\", who went to a \"black butler\" inspired cafe in Japan for her birthday and I finally made myself watch the whole thing last night. I swear, both Brina Palencia and J. Michael Tatum, did such a terrific job in doing the voiceovers for Sebastian and Ciel. I really would give credit to these two because they just attach with the story so well and did a killer English accent that you wouldn't think they were Americans at all! This series really does make you laugh including the other four servants who just are so cute and clumsy at the same time. Although the other butler who always tries to commit suicide but always seem to fail , it really does make you rather sad than laugh out loud to his actions. At least the character isn't killed off but honestly, why did Ciels aunt have to be killed off? Seriously she would've been useful. I really couldn't stand Ciels fiancee, she was just so whiny and b*tchy that whenever she has her own scenes, I just skip them. I really think the writers made a huge mistake in not giving Sebastian and Ciel a gay realtionship, they just are so attached to each other that it just doesn't make sense to me. They are a master and servant with huge feelings for God sake! They are both demons at the end of the day!I enjoyed this anime like the tone of it was just spot on for a Victorian anime series, ill give this 8/10!",
        "Sebastian is the perfect Butler to Ciel. Not only does he protect him with his life, Sebastian is also a Demon which makes his ability even stronger. But Sebastian doesn't serves Ciel, because he pays him with money, but with his soul. Ciel wants to take revenge on the people who killed his parents which is why he sold his soul to Sebastian for his support.Black Butler has a basic idea that without a doubt could have been implemented magnificently.Unfortunately, it wasn't. The anime gets entangled in so many directions that at some point it just gets confusing and you wonder what the goal of it all is.I think that's a shame, because the series had such great potential, which was then simply thrown away...",
        "Season 1 does a great job of setting the stage for what's to come, and gives just enough attention to each character to get a good idea of them. This fantasy version of London works well with the action, as well. That being said, I felt like season 1 could be half the length it is. There's a lot of fluff and filler, which isn't a crime, but makes the jump to the final arc of S1 somewhat jarring. I found myself putting the show down quite often because of the side plots and filler.Season 2 (controversy about canon aside) is worlds better in terms of pacing, but is also ridiculously dramatic. I enjoyed the new characters, and how they contrast with the cast we got to know in S1. There is a bit of retconning, though, so some of the plot holes aren't filled in a very satisfying way. S2 took me a week to watch, compared to two months for S1.If you're not worried about continuity between the anime and manga, I would recommend this show. It kept me guessing what would happen next, dull filler episodes aside. Grell is also an amazing character (I think the cast is charming as a whole, though), and seeing her throughout the series kept me going. If you're interested, definitely take the time to watch!",
        "Set in an Victorian era London, lives the 13 year old Ciel Phantomhive as earl. He got this position after the Phantomhive manor was attacked and set on fire killing his parents and his dog, Sebastian. (The story contains many dark elements but let's not go into detail. Also, the anime shows it differently from manga). After much endurance, he unintentionally managed to summon a demon and formed a contract with him. Hence, the Faustian contract symbol on Ciel's right eye. After the formation of the contract, the demon reveals he will consume Ciel's soul as payment for helping him achieve his goal; revenge on those who brought down the House of Phantomhive. The demon then starts living as Ciel's Butler until Ciel could get his revenge. Ciel then names him Sebastian Michaelis, after his deceased pet dog.The concept is very dark and interesting but the anime decided to take a different route from manga. While, it is still understandable and the storyline still remains as interesting, it's the characterization, that takes the beating. Few of the antagonists like Lau and Fallen Angel developed faster than we expected. It felt rushed. Interestingly, we hardly got to know anything about Elizabeth and Undertaker in this season despite the fact that Ciel's fate was shown in this season itself. It was not until Book of Atlantic, do we get to see their real motives. The anime contains the references of many European literature and it also briefly talked about Indian/Hindu mythology. Each of those references looked well researched and felt accurate. The kind of an action we see in the anime, doesn't look 100% satisfying. I felt the anime had a potential to have even more intensed climax and more powerful action scenes.Is the anime recommendable? Only if you are not a manga reader. Is the manga recommendable? Maybe. I am certain that the manga content must be multiple times better than the anime version. Lastly, even though I was always okay with that, I feel the need to say this - Beware, this anime contains some indirect homosexual contents. If you are not comfortable with that, you can avoid watching this show.",
        "From A1 Pictures and Squenix comes a 24 episode anime based on the popular manga. A young Victorian aristocrat makes a demonic pact to avenge his murdered parents, while also running Britain's underworld. Together, the earl Ciel Phantomhive and his 'One Hell of A Butler', Sebastian, battle everything from drug runners to serial killers to demon hounds to even other angels, ghosts and demons.A glorious mess if there ever was one, this has to be one of the most fun yet unbalanced shows I've ever sat down for. On the definite up, the animation is rock solid and dynamic, the voice cast in either language is spot on, and the Victorian setting allows for a lot of weaving in of actual history and culture from the era (not limited to but including Jack The Ripper, Hound of the Baskervilles, The Opium Wars, the construction of Tower Bridge and the Eiffel Tower and even a really touching take on the story of the Princes in the Tower thankfully free of any revisionist history BS). What's more, despite the dark subject, the characters are by large really likable and a lot of fun to be around, with special note going to the wonderfully charismatic yet dry Sebastian (who practically built this franchise), as well as the simply FABULOUS grim reaper and humorous fangirl insert Grell.However, I did say the show was a mess: it's tonally all over the map, one minute dark psychological horror and revenge thriller, the next, your prototypical slapstick wacky anime comedy complete with goofy servants (whose back story and ultimate rational is kind of neat, but it comes really late) and stuff that feels like its prodding at anime tropes and the fanbase (such as the infamous corset and nun scenes). To an extent, it does work and gets a chuckle, especially the latter, much more savvy gags. The issue is not being sure how of this is intentional versus just plain tropes that are part and parcel of anime, but would feel jarring to Westerners more used to tonally cohesive entertainment. Furthermore, at 24 episodes, it's too damn long for this kind of story and Ciel by and large isn't terribly proactive in finding his parents' killers despite the pact, with the whole 'Queen's Guard Dog'aspect being more the bread and butter of the show, and the two sides never fully reconcile save for a few choice moments and hints drops sprinkled very, and I mean even Abrams would blush VERY, liberally across the many episodes. From an entertainment angle it's fine, since I get to spend more time in this world, but to less generous viewers or those new to the weird world of anime, this could be a big deal breaker.Despite that though, it still kept me really engaged, even the really filler-y episodes concerning life in the mansion (because that's what I want in a show about a badass demon butler who can kill with silverware and still be on time for tea!). Its odd mixture of themes and ideas, covered in a thick coating of professional polish, made for a show I was always keen to see the next installment of. Want to know how, say, Penny Dreadful would've been had it been a little more comical and trope-aware? Here's your answer!",
        "This may be the most well written anime series I've seen. Not that it was Oscar-worthy writing, but most of the writing I've seen in anime has always been the thing that prevented me from really loving it. This series doesn't have the lazy, shortcut type of writing that simply fills the plot gaps. It actually builds different stories to support different themes.Anyways, the series themes of revenge and redemption are woven together well with well-crafted story lines. This isn't an anime with non-stop action, but it does have its share of dark supernatural battle scenes, as well as witty humorous battle scenes. There is quite a bit dark humor in different parts of the series, but it's balanced out by traditional anime slapstick comedy (which I'm actually not a fan of and part of the reason it didn't get 10 stars).If you watch the dubbed version, the translation and acting are all excellent. Some hardcore anime fans complain about the fake cockney accents, but they're mostly limited to some supporting characters. The voices for the two main characters (Ciel and Sebastian) are portrayed terrifically and are true in tone to their Japanese voice counterparts (I saw season 2 in the subbed version). Simply put, this may be the best job of versioning I've ever seen in anime. In its early U.S. import days, anime had horrible translations in both subbed and dubbed versions, due to what I expect as literal translations of the script from Japanese to English. Funimation has really done well in this department, as they've taken the meanings of the original Japanese script and rewritten it in English with English idioms and phrases that work perfectly with the characters and themes, rather than just lazily taking the Japanese words and translating them directly into English words, creating phrases that are unusual or that simply don't make any sense.",
        "\"Black Butler\" started a bit disappointing. It was clear from the beginning, that the anime would walk in the footsteps of \"Deathnotes\". After some time, the typical anime plots (Faustian Pact, Lost Parents, Revenge, Friendship) are revealed but then the Victorian Age feeling gets much better and bigger attention. There's a ton of really well researched stuff and the tension rises as the main story unfolds. The show is not as good as \"Death Note\" and has imho a lot of homosexual content in it, which is more or less openly shown. I assume it is, among other things, to attract more female and viewers. The funny thing is, that females are either shown as dolls, clumsy servants, killing machines or just some extras. While Walt Disney is getting really feminist lately, the Japanese have yet to invent better female - believable - anime characters. Including all flaws - this is one of the best anime shows at the moment. A mixture of Steampunk, Gothic Horror and Crime. Not too violent and gory but at times very thrilling! 8/10",
        "Very interesting, the plot points and character development were off the roof! I'm not much of an anime watcher, but boy, is this an exception. I'd read the manga, and it was super duper good, so I binged the show to learn it was one of the few manga's that got turned into a show that were actually really enjoyable! 10/10 would binge again.",
        "Black Butler is my favourite anime for a reason. It blends dark humour in with dark plots with the same anime charm that Fairy Tail and many others have. It's also the only anime I've found that has a dub that's better than the original. It's the best anime dub I've ever heard, and since the show is set in late 19th century England, British sounding voice actors fit even more. The accents are exaggerated and are made to be extra posh, but they never ever annoy me. The plot is straight forward, young Ciel Phantomhive summons a demon to save himself from the torture he was being put through. Ciel names the demon Sebastian and asks him to take on the form of a butler to help him as he is now the owner of the Phantomhive manor, previously belonging to his murdered parents. Ciel makes a deal with Sebastian stating that when he finds the killer of his parents, Sebastian can have his soul. Together they police England's criminal underworld and dispose of anything the Queen tells them to dispose of. All the main characters are likable and interesting and are well developed. Ciel is my favourite character. He is arrogant and is aware of it and is very pessimistic, but he has a reason for his sadness (his parents murder) and we get plenty of flashbacks revealing his backstory. He also has some of the funniest lines in the show. Sebastian comes close to being my favourite, however I just like Ciel a little more. Sebastian just doesn't give a single damn about the current situation most of the time and is an absolute bad ass. The two work perfectly with each other. The story arcs are some of the best I've ever seen in any form of media and there are no plot holes. Even the FILLER episodes are enjoyable because I just love watching what life is like in the Phantomhive household with Sebastian, Ciel, and the servants. The all have great personalities that bounce off of each other perfectly. And, without spoiling anything, the ending is incredible. This season blew a lot of people away. So many people were blown away in fact, that they've turned it into a full on franchise. Releasing constant chapters of the manga every year, a second season, and 3 manga adaptions that are absolutely spectacular. Black Butler has a consistent good quality throughout season one, and I'm glad that they have that consistency. Check this season out and then watch the second one and the manga adaptions. It's honestly such and underrated and overlooked anime and despite the giant fan-base, most anime watchers aren't aware of it's existence or it's brilliance. Which is understandable as there are tons of great anime out there that came out at around the same time as Black Butler like Fairy Tail, Attack On Titan, Death Note and so much more. But this one definitely stands out from the rest in my opinion. Absolutely amazing anime.",
        "If you wanna suffer through days of brain-dead plot-holes obnoxiously annoying characters and writing that seems to hint arrogance in its-self, go on and watch this... the only good thing about this i can possibly find is the beautiful, but then again very typical anime art that reminds me a lot of D.Grey-man but lacks that series variety...If you wanna watch a tired master-slave philosophy, clumsily disguised sadomasochism and hints to pedophilia have fun. There are amazing anime series and its hard to say, how they turn out in the end, since many series tend to change drastically over their course. But after now 12 episodes i can't take anymore of this nonsense. Weak and childish humor mixed with \"blend-away-gore\" which worsens this desperate attempt to make something that is dull and mainstream look somehow classy... It's a big mass of nobility pandering for little princesses, who replaced pink for black in hopes of sticking out of the crowd just the same way... Tim Burton \u00e1 la stupid.",
        "Wouldn't say I would watch it again. Going to try the manga though so we shall see!",

I say it as a jack the riper era London, meets demon bonding.I believe the manga was still on going, but some of the fan ships that turned me off this show some of the interactions with a hungry demon are romanticized on someone who it should not be romanticized on.",
        "I discovered this anime when I was 14, but I decided to rewatch it not too long ago.DISCLAIMER: This is a review of season 1 only. I have watched season 2 but it's utter trash and not worth discussing. I have never watched any of the OVA's, films or extra miniseries (Book of Circus etc.)First of all: I liked the animation a lot. It wasn't the smoothest thing I have ever seen, but the details were impressive. It really had a gothic style to it that really helped to set the mood and I think the aesthetic might be one of the most influential and iconic parts of Black Butler.The music is also an attractive feature of this series and gave everything the right atmosphere. Especially the Latin chants that were being used were very effective.I have mixed feelings about the story as well as the characters. There were parts and characters that I liked a lot and others that gave me secondhand embarrassment for being so badly written. However, I feel like the things that I consider 'flaws' could be considered the best parts by people who prefer the goofy, comedic side of Black Butler over the psychological, dramatic side.What I personally found very fascinating about this anime were the characters of Ciel and Sebastian and their twisted, complicated relationship. The question that still lingers in my mind is: who was the one who was truly in control? Was it Sebastian since he was a much more powerful, supernatural creature? Or does he slowly get a soft spot for his 'young master' and let him gain too much power over him? Throughout the series it's like Ciel and Sebastian are playing a twisted little game that is just between the two of them. To me, that's one of the strongest points of this anime.What also made up for all the flaws to me was the ending, which was in my opinion, brilliantly written and was the perfect ending to the story. It is therefore that I do not recommend watching season 2, because it 'disturbs' that beautiful ending in a crude, badly written way.The mayor problem with this anime is that it doesn't know which genre it is: is it goofy comedy or supernatural psychological drama? Combining comedy and drama is of course possible, but it in my opinion, it didn't work very well in this case.However, overall I think this anime has some extremely strong parts that easily make up for the lesser parts. But that could just be my own emotions playing up, because flawed or not, I am attached to this series.",
        "Season 1 was funny- the half was wholesome ish and the other half was more serious. Season 2 was great but i got bored on the first episode of season 3. It was like the plot line and character development of season 1 and 2 was non existent. But if you are going to watch black butler, i would suggest only watching season 1 and 2.",
        "My 9/10 is for season one only. I absolutely loved Ciel and Sebastian. The voice talents of J Michael Tatum are simlly divine and so perfect for Sebastian.\nUnfortunately though, I didn't feel the same connection to season two's characters.",
        "I have watched this anime more than once and fell in love with season 1 and all the Ova's. Season 2 I have come to a pretty soild conclusion has nothing to do with Season 1 time frame at all; if season two does happen it happens about two years after season 1 ends. Coming to this conclusion also makes make believe that Season two just does not happen within the Black Butler timeline at all, it would cross paths with at least two other crimes that were being solved by Ciel at the time Season 2 would have also been taking place.Beside the very confusing Season 2, this show was very good, I loved the characters and the animation was great even comparing it to some of todays animation shows and scenc done in them. The dynamic between the butler and master is good never really changes yet still improves ever season, this is one of my favorite parts about the show.",

Funny how in Japanese, everyone has the same accent...While it could have ended simply at Season 1, and since Season 2 was half filler anyway, I enjoyed the twist of the end of the story for Ciel and Sebastian in Season 2. And, boy!, what a twist! At least, it would seem like the end. Not to knock the \"filler\" - couple of fun episodes in there, so watch! But anti-climactic when the \"end of story\" was in the middle of Season 2.Speaking of end of story, what a head spinner! Truly convoluted. But I must say I feel quite sorry for Sebastian. After his hard work cultivating Ciel's soul, I wish he could have reaped his rewards.There was a perfect explanation of Ciel in there somewhere, that despite the darkness he has experienced and that he wraps himself in, he still had a remarkably noble soul. He had every intention of being true to his contract with Sebastian, he understood completely what he had signed up for, unlike his antagonist in Season 2. But I think Season 2 might show us that the human master may ultimately affect the demon servant too.Sigh. I wish it wasn't over. However, I understand there is another season called Book of Circus. But it is not available on Netflix Canada yet. So I will wait patiently until it comes out. And something about a movie that came out in 2014? My my...O-tanoshimini!",
        "Since me, my son, and my niece have been quarantined together for the past 4 months, we all decided to watch this show together. Ended up finishing it within about a day and a half and now my niece is absolutely obsessed with it. My niece is so obsessed with this show that she \"kins\" the main characters, Ciel and Sebastian or something like that (I don't know I'm a 47 year old man). The comedy in the show is sometimes mediocre but my son thought most of the jokes were pretty funny. I would recommend it to anyone who likes black-comedy and mysteries like Sherlock Holmes. However only rating it 8 stars because of the jokes and the scene with the nun.",
        "This is a really good supernatural anime with a mix of drama and comedy. I started watching it out of boredom, but quickly got draw into it. The story revolves around about a boy of about 12 who is of noble heritage, Ciel and his butler Sebastian. As episodes go on you find out that Sebastian is in fact a demon, and Ciel made a contract with him, thus when the contract comes to a conclusion Sebastian will have his soul. But after watching a few episodes you get a feeling that Sebastian perhaps in some way cares for Ciel, who is his master fro duration of the contract and Sebastian bound to whatever he is told and to protect Ciel fro any harm. Sebastian is talented in many ways, he is strong, fast, smart and so on, for obvious reason he is a demon after all. He's catch phrase \"I am one hell of the butler\". The anime is set in the Victorian England, and there is a strong emphasis on English loving their tea time, which I found so fun because it is true. There are supernatural characters apart from the demon butler, such as the reaper and Devil/demon dog. The characters that bring humour to the series are the household servants of Ciel, Finny the gardener, Meirin the maid and Bardroy or Bard the cook, who seem to be clueless to the fact that Sebastian is a demon. There is also Elizabeth/Lizzy Ciels' fianc\u00e9 who loves him very much and wants nothing but to make him happy. First impression, after a couple of episodes Ciel seemed like an arrogant brat, but after a while you begin to get a real feel of his character. He is a sad and angry boy, who not only lost both of his parents (and later in the show his aunt), but also gone through a lot. As they show a few glimpses that he was tortured profoundly in a some sort of ritual. SO a guess you begin to understand his anger and complete disregard for his own life, and the fact that in a wholehearted consumption of revenge he sold his sole in order to obtain the power necessary to find and carry out revenge on those who done him wrong. This gives the anime a dark note, and there are many sad moments, but nonetheless there are tones of comedy there, and I find it has great balance between them.",
        "I am a fan of the Black Butler manga, and have been since I first watched the anime in middle school. I have since recently rewatched it, and the amount of pedophilia makes this practically unwatchable. There is a lot of very fun concepts and ideas but there is just so much weird sexual jokes and actions towards children that I really just can't give it a good review. It bums me out because I remember really loving the series when I was younger despite its flaws, but as an adult it's awful. I'm also pretty sure that the manga was not nearly this bad in regards to the weird sexual content (it's been a while since I've read the whole thing so I apologize if this is inaccurate). Also like besides that the plot is changes he'd in a way that makes it much more incoherent and confusing as well as just less satisfying. If you really want to watch black butler I recommend watching the few episodes in the first season that follow the manga, and the the movies and special series that also follow the manga instead of this adaptation.",
        "You may found first few episodes weird but story is really nice. Character designing was so good. I really liked this anime, i would have given it 9 rating but 7 is because of tuning of Ciel into demon. Ending of first phase where Sebastian tries to eat Ciel's soul and story ends was so good! but i really didn't like the ending of second season (second phase) where Ciel turns into demon. It was unjust with Sebastian as he served Ciel a lot and what he gets in the end, nothing but a kind of punishment! The story was about the relationship of human and demon but in the end they changed it! It would had been a better ending if he(Sebastian) had eaten his(Ciel) soul, rather than turning into demon! But i really would like to see its another season!",
        "It amazes me that such a good franchise, so original, and so dark is dismissed so lightly. I have been a fan of this ever since I got wind of it! A demon that makes a deal with a young boy who has lost his family, and unlike so many other good vs evil in the Christian USA, it adheres more to Japanese standards. Where there are good demons and bad demons. The Supernatural Franchise made it clear that in this power struggle between Angels and Demons, Humans can receive nothing good from getting in the way of either. Both sides have their agenda's and the human race isn't really an ally of either. After all, the fall was caused by God creating humans. So the Angels both fallen and not are not too well disposed to us. I loved the Anime' and I hope the live action movie holds up as well as the anime' did. This is most entertaining and I hope you don't listen to the nay sayers and watch it for yourself."

    "Naruto: Shippuden": [
        "It is an end of an era, more or less. Bravo, they did a great job ending it, even though they still haven't really ended it. Well, I stopped watching so it ended for me. Seriously, the guys behind Naruto should just end it. Baruto looks promising but give us a break already, stop milking beloved franchises into the ground. Dragonball Super made a joke out of the DBZ universe and Baruto could do just the same thing to Naruto. Anyway, if you are planning on watching this series or watching it again then I recommend doing what I did, skipping all of the filler episodes. Seriously, a fillerless viewing of this show is literally animated art as far as I am concerned.",
        "Naruto's tale has been complicated. It's not terrible, but it's also not Berserk. Although \"beautiful\" is perhaps not the best adjective to use to describe a shounen anime, that is exactly what it is. It's thrilling, unpredictable, plays with your emotions, humorous, tragic, and occasionally just plain annoying, but more than anything, it's wondrous and entertaining while also having the ability to take itself seriously when it needs to. It picks up where the first chapter of Naruto left off, and the opening scenes give us a preview of what's to come.Naruto's characters are all incredibly different from one another. Each individual possesses a distinctive personality, a primary motivation that propels them, and a skill set specialization. And kudos to Kishimoto for his outstanding character design, in which he employed a palette of vivid colors and gave each character a unique appearance to make them stand out.When it wants to, this show can look amazing, and by spectacular I mean the caliber of a high-end motion picture. But occasionally, the level of quality can fall drastically.Another strength of the series is this. The soundtrack Yasuharu Takanashi created for this series is a masterwork that highlights the intensity, tragedies, and anguish of each scene. This soundtrack helps Kishimoto's intended feelings to come over to us in such a powerful way. It gives us a unique connection to the Naruto universe. To get a feel for the soundtrack, I suggest listening to songs like Samidare (Early Summer Rain).More than simply a simple show, Naruto Shippuden is an experience that must be had. Over ten years of manipulating our emotions have suddenly come to an end. Naruto Shippuden is enjoyable in ways that go beyond the television show itself. You may interact with a sizable fans and community for this show. Furthermore, there are countless topics to talk about it given the depth and breadth of its mythos. This series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're okay with the significant commitment, despite having some significant shortcomings. It's not a perfect anime, but the high points more than make up for the negative ones.",
        "Cartoon that managed to capture a generation with thrilling fights and twists. The Akatsuki group was a formidable villain, with original designs and all very interesting and particular. The great ninja war is an epochal event even if I would have preferred far fewer fillers. While the series is clearly focused on fighting, it also leaves room for feelings usually related to loss or war. Really nice Anime.",
        "About Naruto I (2002-2007), it was a great piece of anime, with a very interesting story. Five nations, with five villages of ninja protecting them. With Konoha village in the center, and Naruto, a good hearted orphan, who grew up alone, rejected by most people in town, given that he carries the Kyuubi (the Nine tailed Fox that attacked the village several years ago) sealed inside him. Naruto, in time, is able to surpass many obstacles, sadness, loneliness and he manages with his personality, kind of dumb but honest, persistent, with almost no patience, and some intelligence. He survived thanks to the love showed by Iruka, Kakashi, Jiraiya, Tsunade, the company of Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, Konohamaru, Lee, Sasuke, and others. The Third Hokage also had a role during his childhood. Anyway, Shippuden continues the story after Sasuke's dramatic departure from the village. First of all, I have to acknowledge the soundtrack, was a bit repetitive but well done. Then, the series at the beginning was impressive. Moreless the first 150 episodes were outstanding. The high spots were Gaara's temporal death (Arc of pursuit with Naruto Sakura Kakashi Chiyo Lee Neji Tenten Gai vs Sasori and Deidara), Asuma's death (Shikamaru and company vs Hidan Kakuzu), Jiraiya's death, and Itachi's real story. But from then, started a slow decline. Still managed to bring great moments, but also bad decisions damaged the whole story, especially in the end. The last part (4th world ninja war), became a big tangle. So the last and probably top moment of the series happened during episodes 245-249, when Naruto finally met his mother and she told him how she and Naruto's father Minato (4th Hokage) fell in love, and the tragic events which led to their deaths during Naruto's birthday. That was the best of all Naruto, the most emotive, touching, heartbreaking tearful part. Right below are Jiraiya's death and Asuma's. Jiraiya, was not only a sensei for Naruto, also like a grandfather. Other characters which made the story likable were Shikamaru, Rock Lee, Gai, Kakashi, Tsunade, Killer B. Friendship, sacrifice, protection to beloved ones, are part of the legacy.So with that, the background in Naruto I, it became a powerful story. Turns out, there are 9 beasts with tails, immense power, and the Akatsuki needs them for some evil plan involving the world's dominion. During the first part of Shippuden, they manage to get 7 of 9, including Gaara's Shukaku. But then the way of the show changes and starts to tangle itself. First, with the attack at the Kage Summit where Obito declares war and reveals the plan to everyone (usually the villain keeps the plan secret). Second, the Edo Tensei that resurrected many dead people and somehow we are supposed to believe that Kabuto is powerful enough to control everyone. Then, with Obito, who became the jinchuriki (host) of the ten tailed beasts without absorbing Hachibi and Kyuubi (only a part of them). And Madara Uchiha who resurrected, was freed of Edo Tensei even without taking someone's else life. But worst, then we are told that the real threat was a \"goddess\" named Kaguya, the mother of the man who divided the tailed beasts, the woman that \"took\" the chakra for the ninja world. A twist after another. And Zetsu, one of the Akatsuki, was her will, but had cells of the 1st Hokage, and at some point was the will of Madara. And Naruto and Sasuke \"reincarnations\" of Kaguya's grandsons. Enough.Also, what about the twist of the villains??? Orochimaru, the most evil villain in Naruto I, is killed by Sasuke and then when resurrected, he follows him and obeys like if he was his master. Kabuto too, he saved Sasuke even when the other wanted to kill him. Gaara, Sasori, the Kyuubi, also switched from hate to friendship. Nagato, also called Pain, a former student of Jiraiya who lost his parents and then his best friend Yahiko, becames a cruel person ruling Rain village, and controls everyone through dead moving bodies. But Naruto defeats him, forgives him for killing Jiraiya and so Nagato remembers the good sensei he had and resurrects the killed people in the Konoha attack. Obito, after losing his Konoha life in the accident where he gave his eye to Kakashi, and after losing Rin (his crush and best friend), became a cruel enemy, the man responsible for Naruto's parents death, the Kyuubi incident, and so the suffering during Naruto's childhood. But also, he was indirectly responsible for the destruction of Uchiha clan. Not to mention all the deaths during the 4th war. Oh but at the end he survives the extraction of the Juubi somehow (Killer B also survived the extraction of Hachibi, somehow), redeems himself thanks to Naruto, and saves him from Kaguya. But the worst, Sasuke's.Sasuke was a great character in Naruto I. But in Shippuden, I started to hate it. He became dislikable. All the tragedy around him was perfectly played, his desire of vengeance, the reasons to leave Konoha. But once he killed Itachi and found out the truth, he was absorbed by hate, darkness (influenced by Obito), wanted to destroy Konoha, and tried to kill Naruto and Sakura more than once. Besides, the crimes he committed, against the nations, the Kages, and even at the end episode 475, when he tried again to destroy the world. Man, there's a line. And the decisions around Sasuke basically damaged the story. Invent that Naruto would change his mind, that Sakura would still be in love with him, that Kakashi and the rest would forgive him so easily, NO WAY. I have no doubt that the best choice should have been to let Sasuke die. He had to fight along Naruto against Madara, like it happened, but he should have died there. That was the best way to redeem himself and pay for his crimes. And so, the Uchiha would be extinct, a clan that met love but chose hate, darkness, power. And so Sasuke would have reunited with the only persons he truly loved, his brother, his parents, his family. Because towards the rest of Konoha, he showed nothing but a distant friendship.Then, about Naruto as character, he is solid. He made the series watchable. The hero of the story. Sometimes he was a bit stupid, but I can value his persistence, commitment, passion, kindness. It's true, he had the power to change people's heart. I accept and liked how he changed Gaara, Nagato, Kurama (the Kyuubi). But his obsession of changing Sasuke became dull or tedious at some point. They were not really good friends. There was a link but nothing else. The connection to the story of the 1st Hokage Hashirama and Madara Uchiha was well done, but even these two had a better story as friends who became foes. The other bad point was how he was written in love matter at the end. From the beginning of Naruto, he was shown to care for and love Sakura. So, basically during 600 episodes he loved her, he saved her a lot of times, always thanking her for the healing, he supported her even when she was in love with Sasuke, and resisted every punch he received for angering her. He showed true love for Sakura. And not so much during Naruto I, but in Shippuden, Sakura was shown to love Naruto as well. He changed, won her heart. When she saw him as Kyuubi for the first time, she broke in tears. They spent a lot of time together in missions, she supported him during training, healed him a lot of times, and was there to welcome him each time. The hug after defeating Nagato, the way she kept him alive after Kurama was extracted, or the moment she met Minato while healing Naruto, all those moments proved how she loved him. The declaration she made to stop him from searching Sasuke was more true than false even if it wasn't the best moment. So, when Naruto is written to end up with Hinata, and Sasuke with Sakura, that's the most stupid ridiculous, pathetic decision on this anime. Those couples didn't share not even 1 good moment of reciprocated love during 600 episodes. Always one sided. Besides, with Naruto and Sakura, there was like the relationship Jiraiya and Tsunade had, Minato and Kushina had. An ending with them together, the two disciples of the Sannin ruling Konoha, would have been perfect. For Naruto, true happiness, for Sakura great character development, mature enough to recognize the only man who loves her. Sadly, the writing failed big way. The hero didn't get the girl, just as his sensei.Then, another failure was the ending. Besides the many twists, or unexplained convenient events, there was the lack of drama. The end was more a fairytale story than the tragic dark side showed in the early 150 episodes. There's no possible comparison between villains like Hidan and Kakuzu with the white Madara, Obito and Kaguya. And it was too long. Also, forgiving Orochimaru, Kabuto, Sasuke, all like nothing. And none of the main characters died. Not even one of the 5 Kages. Not even Gai after using 8 gates of chakra. And worst, Neji's death was stupidly used to push a wrong couple. Not even close to the fight with Kidomaru in Naruto I. About the fillers, I agree with many, there were a lot, a few interesting, but many others unnecessary. So, this was the story of Naruto. Powerful, with a tragic past, but with a poor finale.",
        "Attention all Naruto fans, the main franchise has now come to an end and moved on from the original characters' stories. While watching the last episode of this long and amazing Shounen classic, I realized that I am going to have to let this series go, which will be so hard because I have been so attached to this series for two years and it has been a huge part of my life! When I started the Naruto series a few years ago, I was going through some tough times and this show led me away from reality for every single twenty minute episode I watched and brought me into a world full of amazing ninja. At the same time, Team 7 and the rest of the crew gave me some insights on what the future may hold and a handful of memorable life lessons to pass on to the people I meet in the next however many years, which makes it twice as hard to say goodbye.For those of you who have no idea what Naruto has in store, the synopsis seems very simple: Twelve year old orphan named Naruto Uzumaki, goes to the Ninja Academy to become a Gennin and hopefully become Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village, yet he struggles with accomplishing his goal because of how poorly his pupils and citizens of Konoha treat him. One night as all of his pupils graduate the Ninja Academy, a neglected Naruto feels left out and ends up performing a forbidden jutsu (ninja power), resulting in him in becoming a Gennin with his peers. After being put on a ninja team with pink haired Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha, Naruto's rival, the team go through what it takes to be a ninja and how to survive the adventures of their new ranks.There are many great aspects of this series and one of them has to be the characters in the series. Yes, Naruto falls into the Shounen category, which means there are instances where most of the characters have their own spotlight whenever a big battle happens in a clip of episodes. Since there are a ton of episodes in the Naruto series, there has to be instances of character developments for almost every single person in the anime, right? When it comes to this anime the character growth does not always happen in the canon episodes of the show, but creator Hashashi Kishimoto does an excellent job in squeezing in room for the bunch of wonderful characters in this franchise, especially my favorites. \"Who is my favorite character?\" some of you might be asking. Well, it's hard to choose just one, but my top three are...well, besides the main protagonist...Along with great characters, Kishimoto brings in a lot of memorable symbols and themes for the anime. When the symbols reveal themselves on the screen, they tend to stand out in a way that will stay in the viewers' minds, especially during the amazing opening theme songs. Some references include the Hidden Leaf Headband, Naruto's favorite ramen, roses, a singular kunai, etc. And with each of those symbols, the audience will be able to figure out the themes behind the objects. I can't even stress this enough when I talk about the symbols and themes because they are just so dear and special to me. Whenever I have a horrible day, I tend to think about the quotes and/or themes and my day goes from bad to joyful in an instant, just like it did when I got to the Chunin Exam Arc in the original series.Now, onto the animation! All I can say for the art used in this anime is that it's fantastic at times...but at other times, the animation can look quite awkward. There are sequences in the show that have amazing transitions during battles, stellar cinematography, and colors toned out just right for the simplest backgrounds. For a series airing for so long, it surprised me to see the animation stay almost constantly the same...until about episode 370 of Naruto: Shippuden. At that point, the art tends to look somewhat different from the original art. The colors look almost faded, glassy, and almost cheap-looking. This will probably disappoint the viewers as the anime loses its originality in the animation aspect of the series, as it did to me.Instead of sticking to one genre of music for the anime, composers Toshio Masuda and Yasuharu Takanashi add a variety of genres to both the original and Shippuden soundtracks. In the original sound track, Masuda uses a bit of traditional Japanese music, rock, and some softer songs to convey the setting and emotion to each scene the piece of music plays. Examples include Sadness and Sorrow, Rock Lee Game, Go Naruto, and much more, but these are some of the main pieces used in the anime. As for the openings for the original series, especially in Rocks, Haruka Kanata, and Fighting Dreamers-they all have a rock/punk tone to them, which can be appealing to the ears of people who enjoy rock music.For the Shippuden series, there is a variety of genres used to reveal the tone of each mesmerizing scene, opening theme, and ending songs. While most of the songs are part of the rock/pop genre, there are some instances where Takanashi adds some pieces of music that are sentimental, electronic, and even a folk song called Newsong is used as an opening song! Some of my favorite openings from Shippuden include Hero's Come Back!!, Distance, Sign, Silhouette, and the last opening, Kara No Koroko. Gosh, I love the music in here a ton-so much that I have both of the soundtracks saved on YouTube and listen to them constantly.Let's move on to the voice acting for both Japanese and English versions. Both languages are definitely cool to listen to, especially for Shippuden. When I first watched the series two years ago, I had the episodes in Japanese audio and English subtitles because I was more into watching anime in Japanese at the time. I did not mind it because all of the voices sound decent and just right for the characters, but by the time I saw an episode in English right after starting Shippuden, I was shocked! All of the voice actors and actresses have the right voices for the characters they play and I enjoy watching them improve their acting throughout the long franchise. A few voice actors I will like to mention here, Yuri Lowenthal (voice of Sasuke), Dave Wittenberg (voice of Kakashi), and Troy Baker (voices of Yamato and Pain) have some of the most awesome voices for their characters and the growth in their voices make the English Dub really entertaining! I am currently rewatching the Shippuden dub on Adult Swim and I have to say, I am in awe of how much the voice acting progresses in every single arc. Most of the characters' voices improve after each season, which keeps me coming back to watching more episodes in English.8TzKE79Xc.pngThere are no words to describe how wonderful Naruto is and how much this anime means to me; I just love it so much! Even though there will be a new series in the Naruto franchise, Boruto, it still won't compare to the original franchise that a lot of us, fans, grew to love and adore, which is why I am giving this series a five out of five stars! Despite the tons of fillers a lot of the fans strongly dislike, this franchise is nothing like any other long Shounen series. Yes, it is an overrated anime, as most anime watchers say, but that does not matter! What matters is the wonderful ingredients that make the show entertaining for both old and newer anime fans. Once you get up to the amazing and suspenseful episodes of the Naruto franchise, you will find a hidden gem that you might end up keeping inside of your hearts of the rest of your lives.Tumblr_n8iyp5D4Yv1toh5f1o1_500.gif\nEnter a captiontumblr_mrjltmwpmv1svkygno1_500.gifgiphy (1).gifPhew, that was a fun and really emotional post to type! After watching the final episode of Naruto: Shippuden and listening to the soundtracks while typing this review made cry a whole lot because it's going to be hard letting the original franchise go after being apart of it for a while now (about two and a half years). Well, I will still be catching up on the new Boruto series, which will air April 5th and give you guys my first impressions on it as soon as I watch it.Until next time,",
        "I love this anime so much. The story is surprisingly well-planned and everything is just sooo good. Some characters might be neglected but that's tolerable. It's still my favourite anime.",
        "Naruto, a simple, sometimes daft, but very caring person who would give his life to save his friends. This series I have watched from the beginning, to see this little guy turn into a full blown shin-obi in such little time. Now he is learning to use his inner demon called the nine tailed fox. A demon which was sealed into his body when he was a baby by his father to save the hidden leaf village, and also, so other shin-obi nations could not attain the power within. Yet as he grew up, he was ostracized by his own people, and classmates when he entered the shin-obi academy. Looked on as simply the class clown because of his continuous pranks, he felt alone with no one to guide him. However through his antics, he still felt close to his fellow classmates because of it. But would always go home alone to an empty house. Through out his life, his education basically sucked for bad grades. But always seemed to become something of an enigma because of his strong desire to help others. Thus starts him on his path to become the next Hokage of the leaf. Now in the present, he is seventeen years old. And learning to delve deeper into his own soul to overtake and control the nine tailed fox within. With this new powerful weapon, he can have the advantage against a long time rival ex classmate named Sasuke Uchiha. A person who has gone beyond evil in his attempts to destroy the hidden leaf at any cost. Naruto with his friends defeated a section of a group called the Akatsuki. A group of powerful members who have been more than a handful for the leaf. Including one which completely levelled the leaf with one strike. As rebuilding of the leaf started, Naruto then discovers through help of some strange looking sage frogs, that he can attain full control over his Demon. But to do so, would mean to beat his other evil half. With his victory in hand, he now becomes a new transformed man, from a simple shin-obi to a sage, and soon to be Hokage in the near future. His powers grow even more now than ever since his battles within in soul. With his close friends, teachers, Tsunade, and past masters who helped him become a true shin-obi, Naruto is now on the verge of clashing with Sasuke once again. Whether or not he defeats his foe, he simply will not allow Sasuke to hurt those he loves. Especially Sakura. This is a great series, lots of fights, comedy, great music, laughs, sadness, and the ability to show what family is all about. Even though he grew up without parents, he still has more than his share of family within the hidden leaf. Recommended for all to watch, quite possibly the most successful series next to bleach and one piece, and now among the top three to be the longest running anime series to date.",
        "One of the most popular animes of all time..Writing seems to have gotten better than its original series The episodes where they showcase the past were probably the best episodes in the whole series other than the fights. The story was good but had bad pacing at times especially during the fights, some flaws, and also the sub par stories of some of the episodes because almost half of them were fillers. Character development was good also. The characters were alright, there are very few that are likable or interesting.Some of the openings and endings of this anime are legendary and are definitely in the anime hall of fame. The music was amazing. Animation looked pretty good but quite inconsistent at times. It had a similar vibe to the previous series.Overall it was an enjoyable series, it was well rounded and the only thing that really sticked out was the lore and history of this fictional world.Memorable: No.. Rewatchable: Maybe..",
        "An absolute masterpiece for the very first episode of the initial series Shippuden and its later setting is one of the ways the \"brand\" has had such a period of success giving compelling characters and arcs as well as showing perfectly the growth of many of the individuals that create the cast. For all it's flaws (particularly related to pacing and filler) there's a thousand reasons which solidify the shows status as a deserving modern classic amongst the greatest of all time",
        "I enjoyed the series Naruto -- but was surprised at the intensity of Naruto: Shippuden . There is excellent character development and a story that is solid. Unfortunately as with many anime's there are some annoying characters. In addition there are some \"filler\" episodes that are just a bit stupid and detract from the strengths of the main story line. Secondary characters get developed well with episodes contributing to their development. The first part of the series I was able to watch dubbed episodes however, the latter half are subtitled which really becomes a drag. Definitely a strongly recommended series.",
        "\"Naruto Shippuden\" continues its original series and is in no way inferior to it.In fact, \"Naruto Shippuden\" is a lot better than its predecessor.Naruto has only one goal in mind in this sequel:\nNaruto wants to become Hokage of Konoha.In order to achieve this, Naruto makes his way through the ninja-riddled world and its villages, gets to know many interesting people from whom he learns a lot and develops his skills. Of course, all abilities precede the control of the chakra of the Kyuubis that was sealed in him and that has only caused problems for Naruto up to now, because of course he doesn't want to accept that he was sealed in a small, weak boy who doesn't even know how to control his powers.On his journey he gets to know many ups and downs, which nearlly cost him his life more than once.Clear recommendation on my part!",
        "Naruto Shippuden is a transporting and utterly breathtaking experience. The depth of the characters and the dynamics between them is profoundly complex and emotional. The story-line is intense & engaging, and the payoff from witnessing these ever evolving plot points devolop and climax is incredible. The music is outstanding and the fights bloody and memorable. Be sure to avoid fillers, otherwise an absolute legend of a show.",
        "Naruto Shippuden is better than the first series in every way. The characters are all older, the fighting is faster and does not drag out horribly long in the same way the first show did. The show's action is faster, yet still suffers from dragging out a battle by showing endless flashbacks and characters struggling for sanity... all the characters in Naruto are insane.The show's characters are likable and the show starts out good at first, but as it drags on you start to realize that it starts to repeat some past mistakes from the original Naruto. As I have mentioned before this show has so many flashbacks that there are more flashbacks than there is modern time. I come back to this show every once in a while and think \"Wow what was I thinking! This show is good!\" but that after three episodes I realize that \"no\" the show hasn't changed its formula. I guess what makes the show enjoyable is seeing the freaking large cast of characters improve on their skills. The huge cast is good and bad. It is good because it enables diversity, but it is bad because if every character has a three episode long flashback then the show will never end. It also means you lose interest in characters.A good show that knows how to make the action look cooler, but may not necessarily move any faster. Good to watch, but not excellent.",
        "This is amazing anime with absolutely amazing character development and story. These two things are extremely good and I have never seen such good character development anywhere else. 1. Personality development throughout life. And everyone has their own reasons why they do something.\nThe character development is absolutely amazing here. This anime shows the journey of many characters, how they changed and most importantly of all - *why they changed*. It is really amazing. Watching this character development taught me a lot about real life as well. Everyone has their reasons for what they do. It doesn't matter how crazy or bad the person is. If they did it there has to be a reason why they did it. You only need to understand them, ask questions and you will figure out why something happened. It can take some time, but you will understand them. Naruto Shippuden has amazing characters who changed extremely a lot throughout their life and the most amazing thing is that it is quite realistic change, you actually believe human can change like that, that's the way it's portrayed.2. Life is full of PAIN and the root cause is egoism.\nSome people ask \"If God exists why there's so many problems, violence and sadness in this world?\". When I was at church I heard a sermon about that from book of Amos that people are the cause of this. But after watching this anime and listening to Pain I totally understand why there's so much hatred. Look at our world. Think of any problem and you will see that it is related to humans. Wars, poverty, increasing number of people with depression every year, even things like global warming - all are created by humans. And the reason is egoism. We rarely care about anyone else, only about ourselves. We don't want to understand others and there is no mutual understanding. But Naruto did want to create a world with mutual understanding no matter what. And again it is very interesting that in order to start fixing this problem and fix humanity we need to respect others and care about them and in order to do that we need to love our neighbor like we love ourselves. That is exactly what Christianity teaches, so it seems the only way to fix egoistic human nature is through God. Ironically, God is the only way people can stop being egoists and actually fix humanity. So, it is exactly without God that these problems exist. Unfortunately, I don't think people will ever change and I don't really have faith in humanity as a whole, but I do have faith in individual people and that people change, as could be seen in Naruto and how I wrote in point 1.3. Work hard, much harder than others.\nPretty much everything is possible if you work hard! Naruto never, ever gave up. He always worked hard and did it pretty much everyday, but still had time for fun and relaxation on some days. By working hard everyday he became better than anyone else. If something is hard it doesn't mean you're not good enough for it. It means you need to practice a lot and you will become better. As a child Naruto could hardly perform a clone jutsu, but hard work payed off and he became an expert at shadow clone jutsu and after massive amount of work became the strongest Shinobi in the world.4. Building life first, women later. \nNaruto always had correct priorities. Even though he was interested in girls, his goal was to become stronger, to save Sasuke and to find the method to create a peace in the world and mutual understanding. When Sakura pretended to love him he didn't get carried away and instantly rejected her, because saving Sasuke was more important to him than being in relationship with her. Naruto got married only after he finished all of big tasks in his life (and pretty much was ready to be accepted by people as Hokage). You have to work hard first and build your life and think about a relationship later.",
        "Naruto became popular so it's no wonder it didn't just end, although there is a bit of wonder in that, because after all 220 episodes is enough, but this time we got more than double that and that's 500 episodes please. Unbelievable. I don't think I've seen a longer series. It's been a real drag. Let's start with the good part. Our favorite characters are back and they're even better than before! This is really good. The older version of Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura is really TOP notch and the overall introduction of the characters from the original Naruto is awesome here in Shippuden. Another cool thing is the openings. They're really cool, and although there are worse ones towards the end and then one that I thought was downright awful, the good ones prevail. What's good? They're amazing! The environment is also much better. Apart from Konoha of course, we actually visit a lot more places here, which is logical since the series is longer. It's also a bit darker and not as \"fairy tale\" as the original Naruto, which I liked. In fact, a group called Akatsuki comes on the scene which is very, very good and they really upped the quality a lot in my opinion. In the original Naruto it was mainly Orochimaru that pulled it off for me, but he's here too! In the original Naruto, we lost the chance to see Sasuke pretty quickly. Here we get to enjoy him to the fullest, plus there are a lot of flashbacks and a few moments overall that explain a lot. There are also lots and lots of fights, which are excellent. Sometimes it's almost hard to choose which was the best. There's quite a bit to praise, but let's speed things up a bit and get to the negative side unfortunately. Fillery. They were in the original Naruto and they're here... again. Unfortunately. They're... terrible. There are a few good ones, but there are some totally bad ones. That's my opinion. If it weren't for these episodes not being based on the manga, I'd give them a much higher rating. Unfortunately, this brought the series down a lot in my eyes. I mean, 220 episodes was already a total chore, but 500 episodes and there's still more than a quarter of fillers, that's really gross. I've seen them all to get through Naruto completely, but I recommend you skip these filler episodes. Moving on to the next issue I didn't like and that was the ending. The end, meaning the complete end, meaning episode 500. It wasn't bad, but it didn't satisfy me at all. I would have expected a better ending for 720 episodes in total, but you know what? I would have gotten one. If it had ended at episode 478, I would have been perfectly satisfied. I think it would have been a great ending. The episodes above 479 felt unnecessarily drawn out to me already, and once it comes to the final episode, there's not much of it. Besides, towards the end the characters go through a minor appearance change again, and although most of them look pretty good, I didn't like Naruto's appearance much. That's about it. Too bad about the filler and the ending. If it wasn't for that, this is a really great anime that I would recommend right away. If you don't watch the filler episodes, I believe it will be much better. But if I take this series as a whole complete with all the episodes, I think it's no more than good and I can only recommend it purely to fans who have already seen the original Naruto.",
        "The show with the most flashbacks, fillers and ridiculously amount of monologging.However. Great story. Soundtrack and details within details.But it went in for too long.",
        "I can say this one also will be included in my favourite anime listing cause it's so good. And the stories are connecting more with the classic series. And the more painful is Jaraiya's death and Itachi's flashback, they've done a great job with them. And the villain Madara Uchiha, the best broken hero I've seen so far, his words can be relatable in real life too. Won't be knowing Naruto's getting stronger in this sequel. And friendship bond with Kuruma and Naruto. Many peoples backstory is developed in this sequel and it's the best. Wished flashback for Sasuke's father and White Fang of the Leaf's flashback, it could've been better to know them. Highly recommended.",
        "What happened ? Naruto was fun but with this teen Naruto everything went south.Power system out of this world, world building confusing and does not make sense in context.Great characters but the sense of RISC of the main characters makes the fights lackluster and meaningless . When someone dies its a fake or they reverse it. Also the writing poor and takes no chances, animation is sometimes very poor but music is great !",
        "The long running Shounen anime Naruto tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, an orphan, who gets ridiculed by his fellow villagers as he had become a host of the demon fox. It was sealed inside Naruto so that the village could be saved. This made him wanting to earn recognition and dreams of becoming a Hokage, the leader of his village. The show having a ninja theme shows Naruto's progress as a shinobi and the circumstances he comes across as he is on his way to become a greatest ever Hokage.Naruto has a very interesting storyline and despite being so long and being a weekly manga, the story is very properly structured. Almost each (manga canon) arc is connected to the other. Surely, there are many small retcons and plot inconsistencies but they don't have any major effect on the main storyline. Even the major power up moments were not problematic for this theme. It is clear to me that Naruto would never had an access to any of the plot armour had his past trainings failed or had his hardwork not met with a positive result. In short, it somehow managed not to look hypocritical. Anyway, they would always need some strategies to tackle the baddies as most of the times, they were the more powerful ones. The manga also resurrected few major characters for plot's sake shortly after they were killed but the mangaka did manage to explain the situation or the process in a logical way. However, it was surely surprising to see how many times Sasuke managed to defy a certain death situation. Despite the huge universe, only Konohagakure(Naruto's village) got the significant amount of screentime. To me it is understandable because this is what was required as per the plot's convenience. It looked like Kishimoto Masashi wasn't in a position to utilize the other regions of Narutoverse too much unlike Eichiro Oda of One Piece. Despite that, when Shippuden ended, the story did feel like a complete one as if everything has been covered and resolved. It is also worth mentioning that almost each arc has some valuable life lessons, not only for the adolescents but also for the young adults. My suggestion is that if you are not alone in your room and you are watching Naruto, keep an onion and a knife ready and start cutting it whenever there is an emotional or a touching scene. You would know when it is a time to do that.One of the most noticable things about Naruto is its characterization. Almost each characters (yes, even the supporting ones) have their own motives. In most cases, they have their reasons to do what they were doing. Even most of the villains felt genuine when we realise where they come from and how it must've been for them. Almost all major protagonists' and antagonists' actions were driven by their own philosophies. Hence, despite the settings of the fantasy Ninja world, the show still felt very close to the reality. The characters, despite having special abilities, felt very human-like and it was easy to relate to each of them. However, if you are looking forward to the role of your favorite supporting character in Shippuden, you may end up feeling disappointed. Many of the supporting characters, who had a significant role to play in Part 1 either totally became side characters or a comic relief in Part 2. But that does not affect the flow of the original plot. Most likely, they weren't needed much anymore. There is hardly any romance element in this series but the fans love to ship Naruto characters with each other.As per the noughties standard, the animation looks alright for most of the series. However, sometimes it really gets bizarre. The animation was at its worst when Naruto transformed into a six-tailed beast against Pain. It looked worst just when it was supposed to look epic.I cannot help but enjoy its soundtrack. The OSTs sound exactly like how they supposed to be for this kind of a series. There is no room to complain about the OST. You are bound to enjoy them as well as many opening and the ending songs. In short, the soundtrack is just as addictive as anime.The worst thing about this anime is that it has many filler episodes. Since the series is already over, it won't be any issue as we could always skip them but yes, it does manage to affect the flow of this series. Anyway, start watching this show, if you haven't done so yet and feel free to run like Naruto (run while learning forward and arms stretched out behind).",
        "Simply put, this anime has it all. It makes you jump with joy, keeps you interested with action and makes you cry too with the dialogues and bonds between characters.I wish there would be less fillers but it is what it is. The main story is so good that I can see myself rewatching it quite often.It was a pleasure and honor to follow your journey Naruto! I wish we would see your adventures again someday.Itachi - Simply the most awesome character in the whole series 2nd to Naruto himself. I'd even say I feel more respect for itachi than for Naruto at times.",
        "Naruto (2002-2007) was a comedic, fun, and well-written ninja/battle story. Naruto Shippuden (2007-2017) is definitely a much more dark, mature, and self-serious turn for the Naruto franchise. The story arc regarding the Akatsuki and their efforts to destroy what the Shinobi have worked so hard to build is not only entertaining, but blood is certainly shed in this series. Characters will die, there will be death, carnage, you name it. There was a bit of maturity to Naruto classic, but this is without a doubt the Naruto series at its most mature, especially during the Pain Arc, which was Shippuden at its best in general.But when the war arc rolled around, things just got kind of... muddled. The Edo Tensei is without a doubt the worst jutsu in the series, as it's merely used as an excuse to bring back deceased characters for our heroes to fight, and there's not as much of a focus on the martial arts-style fight choreography and hand-to-hand combat aspect that the original show was so well known for. Now you've got sixteen-year-olds using Dragon Ball style abilities like they're Super Saiyans. Not only all that, but the filler is quite plentiful in this show, and can really take you out of the story.",
        "It's one of legendary anime I ever see . In this anime series have to much character and this anime make all their background and develop their character & their story each of others very carefully and smoothly. It's story to it's background music everything is very grateful. Just watch and feel this series .",
        "This was just wonderful! Only complaints are the way they got rid of Madara , the inclusion of the Otsutsuki rabbit woman and that Sasuke and Naruto were reincarnations of those 2 guys i forgot their names. They fell completely out of place from the rest of the series. Other than that it was a magnificent journey.",
        "When I first started watching Naruto I had no idea what it was. At first it seemed a little silly and childish but I soon realized the detail that went into the stories, backstories, the world, the ninja way, chakra, their abilities is all fantasically explained in great detail.Once you get past the silly moments (which actually grow on you) the show has some of the best writing I have ever seen. Despite being a cartoon, this show has an excellent storyline and I am currently on Shippuden ep 135 and I find it to be absolutely incredible in so many ways!The people who do the artwork, the animation have incredible imaginations and bring to life so many things you will never see in any other show.From gengitsu's and all sort of cool jitsu's they bring this show to life in a way that just blows my mind.The way they do the animations is incredible.One of the things that always fascinates me is the way they find ways to counter and strategize in the battles. The detail they go into to explain a fight, or to show the thought processes in the battle are mind blowing and refreshing. They could have been lazy in the writing but not in this show. Shippuden is a very intelligently written show especially in the battles. Also, top notch are the back stories and character development. So many other shows should take notice how well defined the characters are in this fantastic show!I finally purchased Naruto on DVD many years ago. I would purchase Shippuden but there are so many seasons it's a little too expensive for me at this stage of my life. I hope they eventually release a full boxset of all the seasons on Amazon in Canada.I highly recommend Naruto and Shippuden. It's one of the best stories I have watched in an anime.I have cheered for him, actually had tears coming down when a certain character passed away in later seasons and some of the ending stories for characters are so powerful and touching... kudos to the writing team!I haven't finished watching Shippuden... I really hope the writing stays top notch. I have a feeling it will.I also can't wait to go back and re-watch Naruto once I am done Shippuden. It's been many years since I watched Naruto and now that I have the DVD's from Amazon I am eager to re-watch this wonderful show once I get it into my Plex."

    "Gurren Lagann": [
        "In the distant future humanity lives deep underground in isolated villages. In one such village live protagonists Simon and Kamina live. While mining Simon discovers a mecha head, which they name Lagann, they use it to head to the surface. Here they find the forces of the Spiral King who forced humanity underground. They attack in larger mechas but Simon manages to defeat one, Gurren, and Kamina becomes its new pilot. They learn that by combining the mechas they become much more powerful. As they defeat more and more foes more people rally to their cause, including the voluptuous sniper Yoko. As the series progresses they work their way through the forces of the Spiral King, but not without losses.Eventually it looks as if they have prevailed and no longer need to worry; years pass and humanity is living a good life on the surface\u0085 then a new threat arrives; one that intends to eliminate the 'Spiral Nemesis', of which humanity is a part, from the universe; old enemies must become friends to defeat this new threat that will take our heroes across the galaxy.If you are looking for something deep then this isn't the series for you; the characters are over the top and the action gets more and more crazy as the story progresses. The cast gets fairly large by the end but the characters are easily distinguished. Amidst all the laughs there is some tragedy and the midsection is distinctly downbeat for a few episodes. The primary audience is clearly teenaged boys but it can still be enjoyed by older viewers looking for some good silly fun. There isn't too much to cause offence although some viewers may think Yoko's top doesn't cover as much as it should; and this is definitely focused on. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anime fans wanting lots of laughs and action.",
        "It's a pretty good mecca series with a group of kids working together in transformer robots and saving the world. Definately a anime to watch if you're a mecca fan!",
        "Gurren Lagaan is about a young boy by the name of simon (pronounced as: Sea-mon/See-mon) who digs tunnel for a living because of living underground. Him and his blood brother have a dream of going up to the surface to see what it is like. Thaey attempt to do it but get caught by the village leader. Then they meet this sexy looking woman from littner village and dig deep where Simon finds a robot looking head which he can pilot with his core drill. They escape the village and come up to the surface.They meet characters such as Rossiu, the black siblings (Kittan, Kionon, Kyion and Kyon) sorry I don't remember all of there names but I know they all began with the letter K, Gimmy and Darry, Nia and many others. With that we are are also introduced to some badies such as Viral, LordGenome and so many others.Story wise it was good but had a very slow start, I especially like very emotional *spoiler warning* and I picked up many lessons from it.\nMusic wise it was okay, though in the second half they shouldn't have added singing.The dub was very good I we have a very good cast including Yuri Lowanthal, Kyle Hebert, Michelle Ruff, Johnny Yong Bosch, Doug Stone, Steve Blum, Jamieson Price, Karren Stressman, GK Bown, Stephanie Sheh, Chris Smith, Brianne Siddal, Mela Lee, Hynden Walch/Bridgit Hoffman, Sam Riegel and everybody else thanks to Tony Oliver did a good job. My only fix with the dub was that Brianne Siddal was still voicing Gimmy after the time skip despite being a teenager. If they cast someone like Ben Diskin, Bryce Papenbrock or even Michael Sinterniklaas then that would have been much better.The animation/art style was pretty unique and interesting it is done by the same person behind Kill La Kill from what I have heard.If you like a good mecha anime especially ones with good lessons I highly recommend. As I massive fan of mech type animes such as Code Geass and the Vision of escaflowne I really like this.",
        "Gurren Lagann is action-packed, funny and colourful to the viewers. It's an absolute feast for the eyes and every hard-boiled otaku should watch this show. It's got robots, busty yet rough-and-tough babes, and ultra-masculine protagonists who inhabit these shonen-esque stories and can be role models to boys that have low self-esteem and look upon these larger-than-life characters as inspirations. Simon and Kamina are great leads for the show; and their big-brother/little-brother dynamic is nearly comparable to FullMetal Alchemist. Gurren is a romp that doesn't really break any new ground; but the thing is its memorably creative take on the mecha genre helps Lagann identify itself as a unique show that knows all it wants to do is have fun and not be taken too seriously.The Japanese hardly ever cease to amaze animation lovers the world over; and this lover here approves of this cult-classic show big time! Wonderful stuff!",
        "It's not very often that a television series finishes over a decade ago and I actually feel the need to review it. Gurren Lagann seemed like a series that would entertain me enough to pass some time, but upon reflection, it's a show that provides a little more than just that. I could get hate for this statement, but this show reminded me of my childhood memories of watching the show Beyblade, not what that show has become today, but the original trilogy of seasons. Action-based Anime can feel a little drawn out and while I can't say this show doesn't feel a little drawn out at times, it's definitely worth your time as an Anime fan. If you enjoy good Anime and haven't had the chance to check this one out, here's why it warrants a recommendation from me.The core plot is quite simple. In a future where Earth is run by a Spiral King known as Lordgenome, this story follows Simon and his group of misfits and outcasts who wish to travel to the surface. They have been surviving as diggers in an underground village and wish to see what the rest of the world has to offer. Once reaching the surface, they soon learn that they must combine their robotic suits and armours to form something great enough to take down the overlords of Earth. That premise alone is what hooked me into wanting to get through the series, but the underlying emotional core that this series possesses is what truly made it a much more impactful experience.Yes, you receive the obvious nods at female objectification when it comes to displaying how certain women look, which is present in nearly every popular Anime, but the fact that those comedic aspects are almost used in a way to serve the male characters and add layers to characters that you thought were a little under-written, was a very pleasant surprise. This particular aspect of the show may be viewed differently by others, but the look and specific shots towards the character of Yoko had me either laughing or downright saddened. Although she may not be the best character in the show, she has quite a few moments to shine and upon looking back, I remember quite a few sequences involving her character.Simon is the central character here and without ruining the progression of the show for those who have yet to witness it, Gurren Lagann does a fantastic job at jumping through time and exploring most of this character's life. Every character has progression in some shape or form, but Simon's character started off quite annoying to me throughout the first few episodes of the show, but by the conclusion of the series, his character had evolved into someone I genuinely shared about and the final few episodes of this show gave me goosebumps.That being said, Gurren Lagann isn't without its prolonged conclusion and needless action. I love exciting aspects of any television series or movie, whether it's in live-action, American Animation or Anime, action always impresses me when it has a great story to back it up. Gurren Lagann definitely demonstrates that from start to finish, but the show almost evolves into an over-the-top robot boxing match in space by the end of the series and while it was entertaining to watch, I found myself wishing for a little more of a grounded conclusion (no pun intended) when looking back to where the show first began.Gurren Lagann seems to have been a pretty popular show when it first aired, so I'm not sure that too many hardcore Anime fans haven't had the chance to see it yet, but take this from someone who has become a casual fan of the medium when I say this is well worth a watch. Some of the action is dragged out a little too long in my opinion, and there are certain characters that leave the show a little too early (even though there is a solid payoff), and aside from the final few of episodes, I feel as though the true heart of backstory was slightly lost. I absolutely loved the first half of this show and I was very entertained by the latter half, enough to say that this show borders on being great as a whole. Gurren Lagann is well worth your time.",
        "Very preditable plot and storyline but i dont mind as it was entertaining, joyful to follow the adventure and cringey actions (i will give it a pass since its an old anime, bringing many great nostalgic memories). Recommended to watch.",
        "The mysterious Gunmen appear. Kamina and Simon take up the fight against her. Kamina manages to hijack a Gunmen, expel the occupant Guzack and take the wheel himself. He calls his monster Coo. Kamina and Simon begin to like life on the surface. Here they can fight against the threat of the Gunmen and the Beastmen and show what they're made of.\"Gurren Lagann\" offers good mecha fights and interesting characters that follow a good story.Unfortunately, what bothered me about the anime was the sexualization of some characters.I think that was just out of place and inappropriate.Nevertheless, an anime with a nice drawing style that you can easily devote a weekend to.",
        "This is by far one of the best Shonen animes that's based on mech's that I've ever seen. It is a fantastic storyline that really doesn't get dull and keeps you going until the end. The ending of the show is so disappointing and so frustrating. I really wish that they would have done better with the storyline, and really manage their time better so that they could have made an ending that was both satisfying and Bittersweet, but this ending is neither satisfying or bittersweet, it just sucks. I would highly recommend this series, and even watching it to the end just because it's one of those series you can't stop watching once you've started.",
        "I enjoy anime and have watched tons of them, so when I was looking for a new one to start, I came across Gurren Lagann. It was ranked high and seemed to have a cult following, so I decided to give it a shot. Even though I was not enjoying the initial episodes I continued watching as lots of reviews said you need to give it a few episodes to get into the groove. Well, I watched it till the end and got to say I didn't enjoy it one bit. The story is basic, the dialogues are silly, the characters annoying, everything which happens is over the top. According to me, the target audiences are kids. I simply don't comprehend the rave reviews the show got.",
        "Gurren Lagann is ridiculously stupid and illogical and it knows it, which of course works it its favor. It knows that it isn't a deep character study with a rich, deep fulfilling plot, so it fills most of the episodes to the brim with beautifully animated kick-ass action scenes, though the show has its share of faults. It takes a while to really pick up, at least it did for me. It was only up until maybe halfway through that it started to become awesome. Up until that point the show wasn't terrible. It just didn't really capture my attention. The show did come to a bit of a halt for maybe 3 episodes, when Rossiu decides to turn into a dick, but it's brief and didn't hurt the show overall. Other than that, I had no problems with this show. It's incredibly stupid, but man if it isn't some incredible popcorn entertainment. ( I forgot to mention: the last episode may contain the most epic fight scene of all time. Brace yourself.)",
        "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the pinnacle of anime insanity. No Dragon Ball or super robot show can come close to the ridiculousness of TTGL. It breaks the record, then reaches a million miles further. Its so over-the-top that any anime that would try to beat it would only chase its coat tails.But what really makes TTGL one of the best is its controlled juuuuust enough for you to take it seriously. It isn't amped to 11 every episode. Its well-paced, and gradually progresses. The characters are very likable, the animation is solid, and the music is great! The best moments of the show are perfectly executed, working on so many levels. Its more than gigantic explosions and drills.You'd have to be a sworn enemy of fun to hate TTGL. Its awesome, but emotional too. Its easily one of my favorites.Final note - The movies are mostly rehashes of the TV series. But the final battle...well, let's just say it managed to top itself, somehow. See the second movie's ending for the stunning conclusion to the series, skip the rest.",

If you're a fan of mecha, action, or simply incredible storytelling, Gurren Lagann is an absolute must-watch that will leave you inspired and exhilarated.",
        "I'm speechless.. this show has left an enormous hole in my heart, i feel like a pet or family member has just died after finishing the last episode just knowing that its over. This is possibly the deepest anime or show I've ever seen, it speaks on so many levels. I didn't think a show could have so much substance. I put off watching this show for about 2 years because i knew it was a \"mecha\" genre and i can't stand that type with very few exceptions, i believe that to be one of my biggest regrets. This show is a master piece in every aspect, there's not much more i can say that can sum it up better than that. The story is absolutely amazing from episode one to the very end, the animation style is breath taking and my favorite from any style. The music is crazy, its perfect in every way. The opening and ending themes are catchy and you can just sit there and listen to it endlessly and the voice acting is spectacular. And for any people that are like me and are thinking of passing it up because \"mecha\" this is one title you absolutely need to take a leap of faith with and i am 100% positive you'll fall in love with this show, it doesn't even feel like your typical mecha show even slightly. There's not much more i can add without getting into the show itself, i'll just add this is what every anime or show in general should stride to be.5/5 Why? It IS perfection (imo). The story is just..perfect. The artwork and animation is just so good i want to throw up from excitement, and the music matches it all perfectly. I literally can't think of a single thing i disliked about this show. Do NOT pass this up, it'll become one of your favorites.",
        "Well not that bad, good story line. It's a mystery and the presentation of story was too fast.",
        "The story of a boy who simply wanted to live his life the way it was, and another who dreamed big. Unalike in every way but an undeniable bond and trust shared. The story of Simon and Kamina begin in Giha Village, but it is not long after that they would get blasted off on an adventure that one didn't want and what the other always dreamed of.I have to say, in the beginning, I found both main protagonists annoying and immature in their own ways. Even still, it works. Contradicting philosophies, and a clash of principles made the show more meaningful which eventually contributes to a rich story and colorful characters. Individually, beliefs of both Kamina and Simon are flawed, but together, work in the best way that helped forged their way to the future: progress is important, but so is cautiousness in one's approach. Despite the mecha-on-mecha duels and warfare being the main attraction of the show, it never strayed from the humanity of everything that started from their journey's very beginning, to its grand finale, and eventual conclusion. The constant slapstick humor and raging duels would give way to some very touching moments when it came on screen.I also find the opposite happen to some characters: starting off very appealing and strong, but eventually losing some of the shine they started off with later on in the story. Some of the story's elements felt rushed and used what I felt like was an unnatural plot device rather than something that has been developed naturally over the course of the first couple of episodes used to build up the narrative. Again, even if this is the case, it is during some low points and struggles that make moments afterward feel more intense than ever. The passion rubs off on you eventually.Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was inspiring in many ways. The first few episodes started strong but didn't sit well with me and I thought rode on some clich\u00e9d moments here and there. It still was decent overall and very much rewarding later on as the show progressed. It is without a doubt still one of the best to come out of the early 2000s period of Japanese animation. Even if the animation quality does not compare to the kind of production these days, Gurren Lagann's personality and plot development has a lot of more modern looking shows beat. Sometimes, all we need is someone to believe in us UNCONDITIONALLY even if the odds are against our triumph over difficult challenges. Regardless of whether you are a big fan of the mecha genre or not, there's so much more to love and appreciate apart from the giant battles, blazing infernos, and almost nonstop high-octane action.",
        "Gurren Laggan is a brilliant work done. It is funny and at the same time serious. However, its strength lies in the characters both supporting and major as well as their depth. In my opinion, the anime develops in three phases; the first phase is from episode 1-8. The second phase picks off from episode 9-16 and the final phase is from 17 to the last episode. The first phase does not take the show seriously. Watching the first 7 episodes, the show might appear like a comedy series. Don't take this phase seriously and write the anime off; it is actually building up and setting a pace for a great story arc that follows. On episode 8, the show matures taking a brilliant approach we rarely see in anime. The second phase was on fire. The show now envelopes into a serious anime while maintaining the comedy. It creates simple battles between our heroes and opponents but the fight scenes are so brilliant it will have you cheering on your seat. The third phase was a Revolution. The anime becomes so good, transforming the entire story from a simple \"save the world\" plot into a complex, politically sophisticated \"save the world\" plot. It is here that the characters shine the most. The development of the characters and their depth is nearly unmatched by other anime. The construction of the main and side characters was originally simple but it transitioned them into characters who were actually \"human\" in the third phase. When people speak about Gurren Laggan, fans love to point out at the brilliant action scenes which are well done. However, people forget the political side as well which I dare say is on par with Attack on Titan, Galactic heroes, Code Geass etc. Gurren Laggan is truly among the most amazing mecha animes ever made because it takes a very unique approach to that \"humans vs monsters\" plot we've seen all the time. It serves as a role model for animes with well developed large characters.",
        "Kamina is one of the greatest characters in all of fiction. He single handedly made this show one of the greatest of all time, and the final 5 episode battle is some of the best animation I've ever seen in an animated TV show.",
        "I'll tell you, I WANTED to like this, it's fairly popular, but it is so imbued with inane (translate: \"stupid and preposterous\") \"science,\" uninteresting and under-developed characters, poor graphics and animation, and a thin, ramshackle story line, that I just couldn't. There are a lot of action and battle scenes with big robot thingies, which provides some simple interest - and why I gave it a \"4\" instead of a \"1\" or \"2\" - but those are so hyperactively done that you can just barely make out what's happening. After 27 episodes, I'm still not sure what the point of \"spiral\" and \"anti-spiral\" is, but whatever it is, it's fairly dumb; and whatever it is they purport to do with the universe and the time-space continuum is so flaky, fuzzy, and farcical that I just had to shake my head at the absurdity of it. Rather than trying to emulate science of ANY kind, which they never do, the series would have been better off making everything happen by magic, where you don't need anything to actually be possible, because none of what they do actually IS - any way at all, in any universe, anywhere, ever! Overall, it's silly, inane, and something made for pre-teen males rather than a general audience. If you like a lot of low res bang 'em up, shoot 'em up, rock 'em sock 'em robot stuff, you might find this interesting; otherwise - no.",
        "This show pales in comparison to other giant robot anime of the 80's and 90's and even the early 2000's. First off the characters are inane boring and one dimensional especially yoko whose sole purpose is to make fanboys horny, I mean I don't mind sex appeal in an anime, but at least don't show her boobs every 2 minutes or make her interesting or better yet get rid of her entirely. Now for the music which is horrible in this show call me lame but I can't stand rap it was mildly annoying in the late 80's early 90's but now there's talking animated dogs who rap kitchen appliances it infected are very society like a virulent disease the only cure Heavy Metal and no hair metal crap. Anyway back to gurren lagann if the lame characters and bad music didn't drive you away the moronic plot will I mean it makes no sense first genome is the bad guy and then oh no it was these weird dna helix or whatever aliens they're the real bad guys and now we gotta blow em up because bros. I mean it seems like a five year old wrote the plot to this crapola. As I said before go watch Voltron(classic), Robotech 1985, Big O, or Mobile Suit Gundam instead.",
        "First of all, I'd like to thank IMDB crew for declining my first review of this show because it really took me some time to realize how much I dislike it.*Minor spoilers* Now then... The series follows a young boy, Simon, who grew up in an underground civilisation only to find a mecha while digging through dirt. He finds out that the mecha is very powerful, and uses it to fight the Spiral King who forced humanity underground in the first place.Let's start with the good things first. To begin with, the animation is quite good and some character and mecha designs are very well done. However, the only character I found particularly likeable is Leeron; strange and weird-looking at first but extremely humorous and a true MVP later (as long as we stick to the believable parts of the series). Not gonna lie, the idea of spiral power is unlike anything I've ever seen before, and so is Kamina's macho-energetic spirit. Unfortunately, these bits and pieces are the only thing that kept me from quitting before the end of the series.On the other side, there are many flaws to this show that anyone who's 14 or older could recognise. First and foremost, the show starts to feel really boring and repetitive right after the first few episodes, simply because the good guys never lose. The endless cycle of encountering a problem to jumping in a mecha and screaming names of special moves very quickly becomes dull and frankly annoying. Even when the crew stumbles onto a big problem, there comes Simon and unleashes some great amount of spiral power from within himself, and of course, slays his enemies. They never face any real threat and it's what makes the show most uninteresting.If you come looking for character development, you will leave disappointed as well as I did. Simon appears to be growing up; however, the is still as reckless as a child and Kamina always remains the one person he always strives to be like. Imo it's not a bad thing, but when it serves Simon as an undying source of his power, I will say it is badly used. Furthermore, I never got to catch any character development of the poor Yoko... just the way they sexualised her character made me unable to grasp any other prospect of her personality.The story itself is, as I already mentioned, repetitive. The only thing that changes is the scale of attacks and the virtual 'odds' of survival that you already know are in Simon's favor. The lore of the spirals is well imagined, but since it is a soft magic system, very flexible and prone to plot holes. The alleged bittersweet ending didn't touch me at all, as the matter of a fact, I was glad that something actually made sense in this mess of a show.All in all, I wouldn't recommend Gurren Laggan to anyone, unless they are <10 year olds. And even then I would think of better shows before I do so. Just be nice to yourself and go rewatch Code Geass... at least that's one you cannot regret spending your time on.",
        "No show this short has ever given me the amount of chills as this. The only comparable shows would be the giants: One Piece, Naruto, Haikyuu.This show is a masterpiece.",
        "People usually think of Gainax for Evangelion, and its obvious because Evangelion got all the people of my generation into anime (even if they don't want to admit it...) It was a freakin crazy i-don't-understand-nothing kind of anime series i've never seen before... but nowadays, now that we've seen more and learn more, its not thaaat great, except for the fact that everything we saw after Evangelion was heavily influenced by it, even western stuff.Why do i talk about EVA?, well after all (except for the giant robot part) its nothing nothing at all like Gurren Lagann, its not serious, its not heavy, doesn't keep any information from you, and the main concept of the series (you know, like getting better day by day in Dragon Ball, the search for your own ideals in Samurai x, or the blues in Cowboy Bebop) its completely the opposite. While the main idea in EVA is quite dark and depressive and tries to reach the heart of people through emphathizing with the main character weaknesses, the spiral concept of Gurren Lagann is a call to heroism and faith.So why do I want to compare this two?, first of all the style Gainax made for EVA is clearly present in Gurren Lagann like in most of their series... And second, because for me this two made the same thing in their current time periods, they reminded us why giant robot are so cool!!! Yeah, Evangelion is clearly built for the nineties's standards, being secretive and revolutionary in its way of telling the story, its what we wanted in those days, an anime series that we could call a masterpiece in front of people that didn't watched anime at all... but today we don't care anymore, and Gainax know exactly what we want, super attacks, great fights, great fun, a good story without too much unnecessary story weight, and the best relation between all those parts, if you don't know what i mean go check Gurren Lagann out. It didn't get me addicted like Death Note, Code Geass, claymore or the first Fullmetal alchemist, but later i started to realize i love each one of the episodes of Gurren more, i don't really want to repeat all those series but its been two years and i still watch a Lagann episode or the movie now and then.I love Gurren Lagann, and yeah it has issues, i got bored in one episode (Yoko's episode), but damn its good, even though the second half gets really transformed and sometimes gets you confused you will finally make one big universe in your head for this series... also has the best first episode because it puts in line the main concept trough the chapters of the story getting you all the way to the greatest oh-my-god final episode in anime history, the best.love it love it love it, highly recommend it!",
        "The anime is very awesome we got many big robot battle and an interesting background story.\nThe character is very well developed and was very good written, the animation is extremely high quality\nThe mecha are very cool with interesting weapon and the action scene is very cool",
        "Gurren Lagann animation are very good, the character development is good, all of the action are cooled, the story was adventurous, the mecha are very unique and awesome, plus the the anti spiral is one the most powerful villain in anime, but i have some flaw with series, the dialogue is too action packed and a bit childish, the character design is a bit sensual, especially yoko",
        "Besides the ogling of half naked women, the first arc of this Anime feels more for kids than Adults. It lacks good dialog, has typical anime tropes, and everything is over the top. It feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon than an anime actually. It's watchable, but not what I was hoping for. The second arc (on the other hand) has more adult themes and feels more like an anime. The dialog is better, but not perfect, it still has anime tropes but not as annoying. Everything is still over the top, in fact, this whole anime is probably the definition of \"That escalated quickly\". Overall it's mid to low 6 rating but I'd probably rate the second season higher than the first.I rate my Anime by this rating scale10 = Perfect. Very unlikely I'd give a perfect rating.9 = Excellent\n8 = Very good\n7 = Good\n6 = Watchable\n5 = Barely tolerable\n4, 3, 2 = Trash, wouldn't watch and unlikely a rating for me\n1 = Extremely bad, probably pissed me off in some way, may have given this rating based on principle."

    "Fullmetal Alchemist": [
        "There is a lot to like about the anime series Full Metal Alchemist. For starters: the alchemy and alchemists. They not only stay true to what alchemy really is per definition--a form of chemistry and speculative philosophy practiced in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and concerned principally with discovering methods for transmuting baser metals into gold and with finding a universal solvent and an elixir of life--but they expand a bit on it with the principal of \"equivalent exchange\". The simple explanation of \"equivalent exchange\" is that in order to create something you have to give up or sacrifice something of equal value. Basically, you can't create something out of nothing. It was a blast seeing alchemy and the alchemists at work. They were nearly wizards or superheroes even with their skills.Beyond the alchemy and the various alchemists was the quest of Edward and Alphonse Elric to reunite Alphonse's soul with his body. Their journey led them all over the place all the while they discovered more hidden truths and a major sinister plot. Then, separate from the Elric brothers' quest was a larger scheme involving the country of Amestris, immortality and god-like powers. The main story and all of the smaller stories within the series were great. And they didn't drag the series on too long. They made sure to actually conclude the saga instead of having the Elric's interminably roaming the earth looking for an answer. I love that the show's creators did that. A show such as this--one that has a definite goal--has to conclude. I've seen other shows in which they come up with dumber and dumber ways to keep the show going by denying the main character the completion of his quest. Shows like that get tired and old real quick.So, there is a lot to like about Full Metal Alchemist like I said--which leads me to the small bit that I didn't like. I became real annoyed with the morals of the Elrics and other \"good guys\". Were their morals bad? No, just juvenile and childlike in their simplicity. There were two things in particular. 1.) Their concept of all life being sacred regardless of who's or what life it is. They took it to such an extreme that they were willing to sacrifice themselves to save those who were clearly their enemies. There was even one scene in which one of the protagonists pulled a gun on her friend to save a homunculus (artificially created being). Quite literally it would be like a wife pulling a gun on her husband to prevent him from killing the creature that murdered their child. Really?! Would you kill your own friend to save some other creature just because it has life? That's a hypocritical and oxymoronic action if there ever was one. Let me kill this guy to prevent him from killing a killer!!!!??? Supposedly she did it because she wanted to prevent her good friend from going to the darkside (in a manner of speaking) by letting his anger control him in that moment. People get angry, especially with those who've killed their loved ones. Why deny him that outlet, even if it results in the killing of the killer? Do these moralistic pollyanas believe that somehow a person can control their anger if denied the opportunity to seek revenge? I think quite the opposite. If someone killed a loved one of mine and I could get the chance to end his life that would bring me a least some semblance of closure. Conversely, if I had the opportunity and was denied it because of someone's warped belief that it would \"make me no better than him\" then it would only cause me to be more angry. Because now, in this highly unjust scenario, I have a dead loved one and the killer still breathes. Yes, this is my opinion and I know not everyone would agree. But I feel strongly about not denying someone a chance at their vengeance. How often must victims be chided for wanting justice? It may be considered a human frailty by some but even still, let it be the choice of the wronged person to forgive or not.2.) I took exception with the belief of some of the characters that they could, or even had to, save everyone. To begin with, it is the utmost of arrogance to believe that you can save everyone. Secondly, it is a farce to even believe that everyone deserves to be saved. I don't mean this in an economic sense or a social sense, but in the sense of just good and bad. Of course everyone has a different gauge of good and bad but I'd consider murderers and would be murderers bad, yet some of the protagonists saw that they needed to save them as well.Even with those nauseating moments of saintly altruism that were rather sophomoric in practice I liked the show. It was heavy at times and light at times to keep a balance. The heavy moments, which were reserved for some sort of lesson, seemed after-school special like--like they were spoon feeding you what you should understand from this moment. There were other heavy moments that were done more properly where I didn't think the message was overly sappy. Overall it was a well done anime. It'd be nice if they could reboot it with another quest for the Elrics.",
        "I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to anime, I've seen a few but I'm still finding my feet. I was always told FMA is considered one of the top series and though I enjoyed it I wasn't blown away.FMA: Brotherhood however I found to be considerably better though the fact the same show was remade by the same studio and with the same voice cast baffled me. Now pardon my ignorance but the way I understand it the original series was an adaptation whereas Brotherhood was a loyal version of the original Manga?Regardless I consider to it to be considerably better. The character development seems rushed initially but quickly finds its pace, new additions bring a lot to the story and the actual story arc itself is on a far grander scale.Based on this I can only assume there was a lot of frustration with the original series as it can't have been considered a true adaptation of the source material. We're not talking minor differences here we're talking a different show altogether and certainly a heavily modified plot by comparison.The stellar voice cast, great animation, gripping story and excellent characters clung to me whereas the original series didn't and I fully understand why many told me it was the superior choice.Powerful, fascinating and devastating in places FMA: Brotherhood was a really enjoyable ride that I'm glad I was part of.The Good:Perfect voice castGreat charactersPowerful moving plot throughoutMore consistent in quality than the original seriesThe Bad:Couple of weak episodesRushed beginningI still HATE the over the top facial expressions that break from the anime styleThings I Learnt From This Series:Anyone who wants you to call them \"F\u00fchrer\" is probably up to no goodEnvy is what is known as a \"Trap\" right?Sometimes dead is better (I totally said that in Fred Gwynnes voice)Kids should drink their milk!",
        "In a world where magic exists in the hands of specialised 'state alchemists' (and the occasional villain or renegade), two young brothers become involved in a complex plot to supplant the human race with synthetic humanoids called 'homunculi'. The 64 chapter anime series features numerous subplots and dozens of characters, excellent animation and a compelling storyline. I am not an aficionado of anime but I found this series to be extremely entertaining (although the inexplicable (at least to me) transitions between animation styles was very odd).",
        "The plot is pretty much the same as last time. For those who didn't read my review from last of the original series. I'll give a brief refresher for what the series is about.After their father Van Holnhian left his family, his wife Trisha suddenly catches an illness causing her to die. Leaving her two sons Edward and his younger brother Alphonse to look after themselves. The both go to an alchemy teacher to use knowledge as an attempt to bring back their mom. But at a terrible price. Alphonse loses his entire body and is forced have his sole inside an armour and Edward lost both his arms and legs. They now have to find a way to get their bodies back. Now they are member of the military. Little do they know there is a lot of corruption and it's secrets.For those of you who are probably wondering. Yes I do find this a lot better then the original series. That isn't to say the original show wasn't bad I just personally find this series to be a lot more accurate to the Manga then the original.The newer and up to date animation from bones is a good example of how fair the series has came.The dub cast include Vic Mignoga as Edward Elric did an amazing job as the protagonist himself (Shame on you Funimation for ruining his life). Alongside Caitlin Glass as the beautiful Winary Rochbell and Maxey Whitehead as Alphonse even though I was upset his previous actor didn't come back as he hit before recording but Maxey was an excellent replacement. Everyone else include Todd Haberkorn, Troy Baker, Kenny Green, Trina Nishimura, J. Michael Tatum, Ed Bladlock (RIP), Jerry Russel (RIP), Travis Willingram, John Swasey, Tia Ballard, Barry Yandal, Bob Carter, Stephanie Young and others all did a fantastic job. Please don't listen to the pathic dub hating trolls slandering the dub or KickVic SJW's in the reviews.Also I really love the sound tracks for both the ending and the intro.If you are a fan of the original and wasn't that satisfied about please check out this series.",
        "I fully enjoyed the original FMA since episode 1. It was well thought out. However, Brotherhood is the completely opposite. Since the storyline completely rushed, it does not allow for explanation. I was really looking forward to watching this new version, but Brotherhood is a disappointment for me. The characters are very simple, the plot is predictable, and the art design is very ordinary. The argument seems poor to me and the characters do not grow, they do not have a significant abance, it is all flat. They represent litterally one personality except Homheim and homucolus (Bradley, Father, pride, Envy, greed) they are actually very great characters but they got bad character treatment.Even though the show has no low points, there are really no real high points ever. It's kinda of just a flatline for a majority of it. Everything is serviceable. It checked off all the marks for the most crowd pleasing show. It was about episode 40/41 that I realized that there is no real threat to lives of our heroes(even Chimeras), Nobody dies, except one person (Briggs Officer) that we don't really care about. Overpowered Villains suddenly aren't that powerful, a Good example of it is Pride, he was unbelievably Powerful and then he is completely helpless against Al even though Kimberly is helping him as well.Even in serious scenes, there is a lot of comedy just thrown in there. Which is odd, for how dark the subject material is in the series. I kinda enjoy and not enjoy it at the same time because of its good themes and unique story while bad execution.",
        "This show is the best. Amazing characters, story, humor, and drama. Just the best.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of those shows that you watch not knowing quite what to expect at first; you watch the show some more and see that it is a fairytale for the modern age, influenced by the works of Mike Mignola, steampunk fiction, and has the escapism of the Harry Potter series.Fullmetal Alchemist is an epic tale of family, supernaturalism, men who want to play god, and characters who want to make amends for their past. It is a beautiful show, surprisingly moving, populated with deep and lovable characters whose stories all intertwine with another somewhere down the line.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an absolute classic on the highest level imaginable: the story is outstanding, the animation lively and gorgeous, the music sweeping, and the characters are so diverse and individual in their own right that you never get bored when one episode focuses on a supporting character; there is always something new to show.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an experience in its own right, and one that will surely stand the test of time.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist has become a widely-loved classic in the anime medium, and that's because it's one of those shows that can appeal to those who aren't strict fans of Japanese cartoons in general: it's a paradox show that can appeal to anime's most staunchly harsh critics, and subvert their expectations with its potent storytelling on brotherhood, magic, genocide, parenthood and the loss of innocence. P.S. What is it about animation and losing a parent that comes so hand-in-hand in animated storytelling?Fullmetal Alchemist is a science-fantasy gem and its A+++ caliber storytelling show that anime can be compared to the greatest of live-action television dramas. Fullmetal Alchemist can be enjoyed by the same demographic of people who watch shows like Game of Thrones or fans of the Harry Potter movies (like myself); it also has the same familial themes and values that makes similarly great franchises so timeless. The Elric Brothers are not your typical television/film siblings you'll expect to see; they're a totally different game whom accurately capture what it is (and what it takes) to be brothers.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is wonderful; in every sense of the word. Give it a watch.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was very pleasant to watch. Loved everything about it.First off, the series has a huge cast of interesting & unique characters. They are each quite different from each other, and act in different ways. The way the series elegantly manages all the character's developments and story lines is a feat in itself. The series also has a fantastically crafted plot, filled with action, humor, & tragedy.The animation and art is top notch. The production values are great. The soundtrack is excellent as well, particularly the opening & closing sequences that accompany each episode.It goes on for 64 episodes & maintains your attention the entire time. It even manages to close everything up in a satisfying manner. A fantastic series.",
        "I was immensely impressed with the 2003 adaptation, especially because most of its story was original and not entirely based on the manga, which is a big deal on the creative front. And as I finally finished watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood last night, I was left smiling and satisfied to a degree that hasn't yet been achieved by any other anime I've seen so far. The final act of the series, especially, gives blockbuster live-action MOVIES a run for the money, delivering god tier emotions and action.Renaming this otherwise similarly titled adaptation Brotherhood was a great decision, because the relationship of the Elric brothers is still a major driving force and their \"brotherhood\" is a treat to watch. This is a very atypical shounen when you look at the tone and tropes. The protagonists have a goal, but it much different when you compare it to other shounen anime where training and improvement are the common tropes. This is very much a mature anime even grown ups can fully enjoy, and the balanced tones between dark and extremely funny are very well balanced.After all, Edward's funny face keeps making appearances more frequently this time.Since I first watched the 2003 version first, the initial few episodes of FMAB felt quite fast paced and like a quick summary of the former in a way. However, it slowly developed into a different story and from that point there was no looking back. The plotting is excellent, and even the two filler episodes are a treat to watch. The voice acting is still strong here, and the characters, especially the Elric brothers, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar and Fuhrer Bradley shine to their fullest. A cute and rather notable addition is Mei Chang and her tiny pet panda Xiao-Mei. However, I was most impressed with the characterization of Hohenheim, who didn't feel that impactful in the 2003 version. Here, his character is explored fully and with subtlety, and with time I found him one of the best things about the show.And of course, the action. It is simply outstanding. Some of the fight scenes are so intensely drawn and chaotically edited that they given some serious competition to live-action fights. The final arc of the show is filled with some of the greatest fights and blockbuster moments you will ever experience in an anime or live-action work. The music is similarly apt and a treat to the ears. And again, while there are a lot of dark moments like 2003, this adaptation also adds more hilarity, as a result of which I ended up laughing far more than expected. I have to commend them also for experimenting and adding humor even in the most serious moments, which is something a lot of writers are skeptical of.And guess what else left me speechless? That a shounen like this, where both male and female characters are equally capable and strong, is the work of a woman. Hiromu Arakawa truly has my respect for understanding both genders and delivering a highly intelligent, memorable, haunting and exciting story which is really hard to top. Once you watch this anime, your expectations and standards are going to shoot up. I loved it to the fullest and I would love to add it to my collection, along with the 2003 version of course.",
        "A wonderful anime, but the recent episodes disappointed me greatly, as the balance of power was no longer logical, and the comedy in the anime was not funny and very provocative and the change in the style of the drawing in the comic scenes separated me from the atmosphere of the anime. Absolutely, the anime story was excellent, the fights are great.",
        "I thought that this was one of the most balanced shows out there, in terms of plot complexity, storytelling, humor, action, fan-service, philosophy/science, war, nationalism, etc. You think this is a fantasy show, and then it changes genres 3x (in a good way) as things slowly unravel. Good animation, good music, great edits in jumping back and forth between scenes and timelines.While there isn't any suspense, there's a good amount of conspiracies, twists and turns that you don't see coming. And there's enough going on to keep you curious to see what's about to happen. The show was thrilling, thought-provoking and moving at the same time.The show isn't about ONE protagonist, like a DbZ or a Naruto is. It doesn't come with a disclaimer like \"The show is epic up to when L and Kira fight it out\" that Death Note comes with.This is also a good anime to get your kids into anime with, of course, once they in their teens and can understand what's going on.",
        "At first I was going to say that once you got past the first few episodes the series truly began to become amazing, but upon further thought I take that back. This show is powerful from the very beginning, and while the first few episodes aren't as addicting as the later episodes of the series, they are beyond a doubt powerful enough to get you interested. In fact, the first 4 or so episodes have plenty of scenes and themes that can be quite disturbing and memorable. Once you get past the first few introductory episodes, the plot really starts to become addicting (specifically after a certain event which those who have watched the show can probably guess what I'm talking about) and it becomes really hard to not want to keep watching episode after episode to further the plot.Since this is the \"Complete Collection One\" of two of FMA Brotherhood, that means that you only get half of the episodes in this collection. Considering you get over 30 episodes, this is actually a pretty hefty collection and definitely has a sizable amount of content in relationship to the price.So, in short, Brotherhood is a fantastic and memorable series that doesn't last long enough to run itself dry, and the first collection you see here is a great way to become addicted to the story of the Elric brothers.",
        "I just finished FMAB and I have to say it was so well made. Most of the character was flushed out and had their backstories and goals. The world building was so vast and expansive you can do a whole analysis on that such as the cultures, people, beliefs, and nations. The themes Fullmetal explored was also fantastic such as war, man's inhumanity to man , personal struggle the characters faced, and understanding morality. The author of Fullmetal really put a lot of effort into making Fullmetal. The art, animation, and music was a big plus for this anime also. The comedy in this anime was well done and funny as hell, the funniest anime I have ever watched. The tone and the vibe was very nice also, at times it would get dark but I would be lifted by the comedy. But at times they mixed the comedy with the fights which was suppose to be serious and dark. The story was well done and nothing seemed out of place or didn't make sense.The fights were confusing at times, half the time in the fights the good guys and bad guys were talking too each other way too much and other times they wont even talk and just start fighting. Another things is the pacing, I felt like the creators should have done a better job on shedding Ed's and Al's younger years and their troubles when they first joined the military and also the other characters also. My last problem was the consistency such as keeping the same music people enjoy alot to become a nostalgia for example keeping the same opening instead of it changing every time. And also doing a better job of making the audience care for the characters by doing a better job on the emotional scenes, their origins, and their dialogue.So overall I enjoyed the show, it wasn't a masterpiece to say oh I will remember this show for the rest of my life, or bad to say that I'm never going to watch this show again . FMAB put a lot of passion into the visuals, story, and music which was a big plus because I enjoyed those aspects alot. But I think they could have done a better job in certain scenes and could have made the characters even more interesting and memorable then where they are right now.Memorable: Sort of Rewatchable: Likely..",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the second time that the manga is adapted in a series after the 2003 series, which is also really good though it differs greatly from the source material. No I don't say FMA (addreaviation for Full Metal Alchemist) is bad, but against the remastered 2009 series it doesn't stand a chance.As I first saw FMA and after Brotherhood I will compare these two a lot.So the story begins with the two brothers Alphonse and Edward Elirc ,who after their try in human transmutation in order to bring their mother back to life failed, Al lost his body and Ed an arm and a leg and the how it is well known for anyone who has seen the series or read the manga. So they embark on a mission to get their bodies back to normal, by finding the infamous Philosopher Stone. What I loved with Brotherhood is that it is really fast pasted and you never feel bored and as for the filler, almost none. And as for the characters, are pitch perfect from Mustang to Lin and all the Homonculi except from Lust ,who had a bigger role in the 2003 series.As for the strengths of the series ,the map is more fleshed out with a lot more back story ,lore and even myths, in the series we explore much more of Amestris and the we see the Wall and the older sister of Alex LouisArmstrong ,Olivier one of the most bad ass character and she is as stun and hardcore as her brother is goofy and hilarious. Some other great characters is Lin , one of the princes of Yin who tries to find a mean to win the throne and his bodyguards. But I want to focus on Lin more for he gets from an arrogant and somewhat annoying prince to a mature and responsible adult ,who is fully capable to lead his country, I guess the experience of fighting superhuman creatures and sharing his body with Greed make him more amiable. As for Greed and Scar had a complete 180 degree change and I have to mourn a character so much since the Red Wedding.To return to our brothers Al is saved by Ed much less and his Alchemic skills get much enhanced and to his older shorter (hahahahahaha) brother he is more mature and he never lose focus of his goals. And his romance with Winry is totally heartfelt ,sincer and real and their last photo with their kids was adorable.My last paragraph it is going to be of the antagonists of the series ,Father and his kids , apart from Greed and Lust. Father is one of the most arrogant ,over powered character in anime history and complete disregard for the humans makes him even more abhorrent ,but not as his first born son Pride ,who was twice as hated by me from his father due to his Arrogance and it felt good to see him get mashed from some puny humans. As for Glottuny he was funny and creepy at the same time. King Bradey ,Wrath was an extremely well-written and interesting villain and he is my second favorite of the Homonculi after Greed. Sloth was just their (ok you can;t give to every character, depth) .Finally Envy was an**** a-hole and its demise was quit fitting.All in all it is must was and if you have to choose between the FMA and Brotherhood ,the later is so good I forgot the 2003 series existed and closed the story much better than the 2003 with the Conquest of Samballa (man it was disappointing).",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a really solid anime. It has great art and character design. It has a memorable OST, and an amazing story. By far the best part about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the story. It's not only creative, but it has a deep lore, and the writers have no problem going into that lore. And I always found myself wanting to learn more about the Fullmetal Alchemist universe.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is known for having the best dub of all time, and I completely agree with that statement. I usually avoid dubs, but this is one of those rare occurrences where I recommend checking out the dub. The action in this show is the best action I've seen in an anime so far. The action is easy to follow, it looks smooth, and most importantly, It's entertaining.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the best animes of all time, so therefore, it's a must watch. It can get a little repetitive at times, especially near the end, but overall, it's a very well made anime.",
        "Rating 8.8I get why people say it's the greatest Shonen, however to me it lacks that masterpiece factor that makes it memorable. It's exceptional but very traditional in how it ends on a conventional happy note. It has a lot of cliches/generic tropes but is still a solid show all around.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is without a doubt one of my favorite animes!The two brothers have such a strong bond and work together perfectly as a team.Her intention to find the philosopher's stone in order to retrieve Alphonse's body is brilliantly written, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like an easy task.On their way, the brothers encounter many obstacles, most of which are personified in the form of homoculuses.The anime contains funny but also very serious and shocking moments.The plot twists are also presented exceptionally well.The anime also has an intro that I just couldn't skip.Clear recommendation on my part!",
        "There is no lack of originality on quality anime, the sheer amount of three dimensional characters, twists and creativity puts this art form at the same level of TV and movies.Full Metal Alchemist takes place in a world where a powerful science by the name of alchemy, allows for some individuals to transform the existing matter into different objects of shapes and sizes limited only by the imagination. It follows the story of two brothers who after performing a tabu experiment with alchemy lose parts of their body - Edward loses an arm and a leg, and Alphonse loses his entire body, while Edward was able to place his soul into an armor - and thus begin their quest into recovering what they lost. Just with this, the story is already original and probably very different than anything you've heard before, as it develops we are presented with a huge conspiracy which slowly makes the connection between Ed and Al journey and the faith of the world they live in.FMA has a lot of incredible achievements, it is beautifully made (in no occasion the animations felt weird even in fast motions such as battles), the journey and how the dots connect are really well done considering the size of the plot and of course, probably its best strength, the amount of characters (and not just simple by standers) that we get to know and that influence the protagonists on their journey. It's difficult to mention more without getting into spoilers, but both Ed and Al are about to embark on a life changing adventure, fueled by the curiosity to seek more knowledge and of course the urge to have their lives back to the normal they once had.Adding to the above, we are also confronted with some interesting ideas and messages conveyed by the story, one example is the Ishval war coming very closely to a lot of actual real life war settings, specially with the Second World War and the consequences of such events and how the inhabitants of different countries in conflict perceive each other.Also, a lot of philosophical subjects are allowed for some space in the show, the dangerous of pure belief in science advancement and the sacrifices on humanity that we are prepared to do in the name of it, questioning what actually makes a human if not simply the physical materials that constitute us what would actually be what we metaphorically call the \"soul\"?\nThese are just some of the on point topics that FMA brings to the table, among political corruption, human greed and other \"sins\", it is very rare we see such a huge plot capable of bringing all of this into a not so long narrative.The only criticism I will make is in the actual end, the main antagonist and his motives can of course be left for interpretation but they didn't quite convice me, I read some analysis and reviews afterwards, and I get the grasp of what the writer intended, yet I wasn't fully satisfied with it - but again, this is a good example where the journey is better than the actual outcome, and aside from this small details I really enjoyed the ending!",
        "I would rate this TV series as easily one of the best ever made. Period. Character development is unsurpassed and rivaled by few. Given the size of the series, clocking at 64 episodes, it's a great achievement. The artistic quality is also way above average with very good animation and moderate level of detail.This series is also more entertaining and easier to understand than other masterpieces of serial animation (such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Serial Experiments Lain and Haibane Renmei), hence I recommend this series to a wider spectrum than the specialists in Japanese animation. A must watch for everybody.",
        "Fullmetal alchemist Brothethood is one of the best if not the best shows I've ever seen. Everything from Animation to music is top class. It has some of the best written and most memorable characters ever. A very deep, engaging and interesting story. I honestly have nothing negative to say about it. It's a must watch.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood stands among some of the greatest animated TV shows of all time. With character arcs lasting seasons that pay off perfectly, a score that sets the tone for the show as extremely dark but also far from hopeless and creative animation that makes this world stand out from others. Brotherhood also offers some of the best action in anime, with incredibly brutal deaths as well as extremely disturbing moments almost as soon as you jump into the show. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood will rank as one of my favorite TV shows of all time.",
        "It's waring on my patience, the more character's that get introduced, the pointless conversations, -completely- pointless sub-plots. It feels like a lot of this show is either localized in an incredibly contrived way, or there's quite a lot of filler.Still, I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons (or Parts as Netflix is calling them) and due to the love this series has gotten I'll keep trying to watch. Not a -true- anime fan - I like Bebop, NG:E, Akira, took the chance on this and loved the charm and bounciness of the the plot of this show. I'll edit this if my opinon changes in some major way.",
        "Japanese television \ud83d\udcfa series translated and voiced over to english. Wow! I'm telling you, you'll change your life for the better after watching this highly acclaimed show on netflix. It discusses the first law of thermodynamics, aka transmutation etc. They use language that is alien \ud83d\udc7d but understandable by modern laws of physics you see. When they cross over into the spiritual realm, is when the show gets really deep. The questions of what is spiritual, start to develop with the Elric Boys. The two brothers lost a mother and the older tries to bring her back this killing his brother but saving his soul inside of a giant metallic robot. I know, it's a bit crazy, but it all comes together nicely. Enjoy, and tell me what you think of the endearing and everlasting dynamic show! Murf",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.Such was what I discovered when I first laid my eyes on the original FMA series. And yet, for all it's greatness, it began to flounder in it's second season. As many series do, it took on its own form and story, and it was at that point that it started to lose its charm. So, Bones did the smart thing. They remade it. For most series, this would be pointless, but for FMA, it's very much welcome. Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.It's hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren't subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details. These are what make the new FMA an instant new-age classic. Like FMA was the first time around, the new FMA will be one of the top anime to watch out for in the states."

    "Haikyu!!": [
        "I've seen far more anime than most other 51 year-old Americans, but that still isn't a lot compared to younger folks who are obsessed with it. I mention this because my perspective, no doubt, is not that of a typical younger fan. So, while the other review, so far, is glowing and describes the show glowingly, I am not a fan and don't have the same sort of life experiences. Now I am NOT saying that \"Haikyuu!\" is a bad show...but I just didn't experience it the same way that the other reviewer did. As for me, I've watched a few anime series here and there and have watched a few hundred Japanese films...mostly live action. So keep this in mind as you read this.The story centers on an incredibly chipper and high-energy high school student in his first year. While Hinata loves volleyball, in middle school he barely got a chance to play at all due to the few kids in his school who wanted to play. He also has little experience and is quite short. In his one chance to play in a game, his team is soundly defeated and one of the opposing players, Kageyama, ends up going to the same high school as Hinata!! Considering how arrogant Kageyama is, it's not surprising that the two being fighting instead of working together as teammates. Naturally, they eventually learn the spirit of teamwork and soon their team goes from mediocre to amazing. Can the spirit of competition and teamwork take them to the top?Like many sports anime programs, the show is way over the top as far as how the various players act and react. Subtle, it ain't...but it is often quite enjoyable and the more you watch the more you get sucked into the story. The animation quality is about on par with any other anime, the writing quite nice and non-anime lovers should still appreciate the show. Among the best anime I have seen? No...but still well made and engaging.",
        "I hated volleyball in school so this anime actually brought bad memories of it in a sorta good way lol. I really liked the enthusiasm and high confidience of Hinata. That kind of character really does lighten the anime's mood up and would really make you watch much more of it!It even acknowledges friendship as well, Hinata really brought in his old enemy's and his own pals to work together in order to win tournaments with such great amount of victory!Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes the volleyball sport or just wants to watch a different type of anime!",
        "\"Haikyuu!!\" tells the story of a volleyball team that once was a respected power but now is only belittled by its opponents. When two new and very dedicated students arrive, a new time seems to begin, promising long lost glory.The first few episodes are hard. I don't know how often they mention that Hinata is small but very fast but it almost makes you angry. The beginning totally lacks to connect other characters into the story to really keep you interested in their way. Strangely enough, this is exactly what happens in the later episods, which is why I was really looking forward to every episode then. I don't know if this is meant to be or if the producers just noticed their own problems but it is one of the rare examples where a show gets better and better over time (so far). Of course the plot is rather limited and I would not want seven seasons of this show but I think that if they stop after three or four seasons this could be remembered as a great show.All in all you need some time to really invest into the characters but if you give yourself this time there is a fair chance that you will stay hooked.",
        "One of the challenges of a sports story, IMO, is that it's the same game, and there are only so many different things you can show in each game without making it seem repetitive. Easier to do in a movie in which the entire sports content may last for 30-40 mins from a 2 hour movie, therefore tougher to pull this off in a tv show.This complexity is taken to a whole new level when you show a Volleyball match over 1.5 to 2.5 episodes/30-60 mins (60-90 mins in real life?) you have to be as detailed as possible. So how do you show as many details as you can without losing the intensity, keeping in mind that there are several other matches to follow in the entire tournament? I think the writers did an amazing job in dealing with this challenge.As the case is with all sports stories - self/over confidence, ambition, determination, winning/losing, teamwork, conflicts etc. are explored and are not overdone. I've only finished Season 1 for now, but will be watching the other 3 seasons as well. So far, the storytelling and the sports action has been amazing! There're a decent amount of humor and emotions too. If you don't know anything about the sport, that's fine, they do a good job of explaining everything.If you like Volleyball/Anime/Sports, you should totally check this out!",
        "\"Haikyuu!!\" has unexpectedly become one of my favorite animes.At first I thought \"It's an anime about volleyball, how good can it be?\".Turns out the anime is outstanding!The various characters are all so well written that it's almost cheeky.Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses.And how the Karasuno team is made up of so many different personalities is awesome.The characters complement each other perfectly.You get excited about every game in high school and just hope that if the team loses, they can somehow turn the game around.The animations are sometimes just breathtaking!\"Haikyuu!!\" Is exactly what it wants to be and perfect.I can't find any criticism of this anime, which I've already gotten a second run through and although you already know who will win now, the feeling for me was still similar to the first time.I recommend everyone to give this anime a try, even if you're not usually a volleyball fan.",
        "Wow. I really did not expect to fall down the rabbit hole that is Haikyuu!! I thought that the art style isn't one that I usually gravitate to but I was quickly won over by the story and characters. I loved all of the characters and their relationships and friendships with each other and it was inspiring to see the underdog climb to the top, that even though it seems as if one is disadvantaged, they can still succeed through sheer willpower and by working together with like-minded passionate people. Honestly, watching this made me regret not taking volleyball seriously during PE in high school.",
        "I thought at first this would be good becuse I like sport anime's. I never have played volleyball besides a few times in pe class. I felt at some point in the series I started to get bored of watching it. There wasn't enough drama in the story. That says a lot becuse I love slice of life and they tension to be very chill with little drama sometimes. The character development was fine. The script wasn't anything special it was about average. The animation was good. I liked that it was set during high school. The plot seemd like it was gonna be good. But as it turned out the plot was very boring. Not much happened in this series. It need more drama really bad. The animation style was very good and well done. I would recommend this series to little to no people to be honest.",
        "Really enjoyed this well-made anime on Volleyball, I didn't know much about the sports and its rules, didn't realize so much strategy went into it and how important team play is. The plot is your typical shounen sports stereotype, an underdog who excels with determination, along the way he makes friends and each one in the team is a standout specialist. The anime is well-paced and keeps things exciting all throughout, there is lots of humor to give you big laughs. The storytelling utilizes the full spectrum of emotions from losses to win, from giving up to never giving in, from timidity to overconfident, from solo play to teamwork, it covers each aspect of the gameplay with relevant emotions. Another good side to the anime is the realistic gameplay, no over the board plays, and super moves. The characters are all likable, one of the few anime without having any evil guy in it.The anime itself is really good, got great art and colors. Did feel the music could have been better, nothing of it stands out in mind after a week of watching the anime.It was enjoyable enough for Binge-watch, so hopefully, you get the idea. Season 1 & 2 both were great, after a break of 2 years, I have binged watched Season 3 & Part 1 of Season 4 also, again they were really good.",
        "(Short Review)Haikyuu Season 3, This is the best Haikyuu season, of course, Season 3 started in a very great way and ended with an episode that we will never forget, it was one of the best anime I've ever watched in my life, 10/10.Production, Drawing and Animation, How can I describe the mastery and creativity in doing the animation in the anime, all the scenes were great, and I liked how it was drawn like a manga with every detail with smooth movement.The direction and soundtrack especially in the past episodes were amazing, Season 3 of Haikyuu gave us many messages and lessons, it was a short season but it had a lot to offer, and what it delivered in this season is more than expected.This anime entered my heart more and I loved this season a lot and I will not forget it, it made us always sympathize with the characters and grieve when losing, rejoice when winning and be affected, Haikyuu anime is love and life, not just an anime.",

If you want advice then Don't hesitate start to watch it. I assure you Won't regret.",

I could not stop watching! Exceeded every expectation I had about this show! I strongly advise you to stop reading this and go watch Haiku right now!",
        "Haikyuu deserves a 10/10. The show is made up brilliantly and there's no filler episode were I spend my time on the phone. The pace of the show and the typical Anime serious moments in this are perfect, not to exaggerated. I swear I like Volleyball as a Sport, but never thought I'd watch an Anime about it. Haikyuu stays for team spirit, development, goals, nice humor, lovely and sad scenes. I found this masterpiece on Netflix and I'm not surprised this hasn't an equal hype like other sport Anime's ( Captain Tsubasa ), cause it's just Volleyball. Well then I tell you if you think like that you'll 100% miss an amazing and entertaining show. I'm super excited for next years season.",

        "Damn it's a pure masterpiece. I've just finished season 4 and I can't wait for season 5. This anime is one of the best anime I have ever watched and it leaves me shook whenever Karasuno enters the court. Watch this series. If this is your first time watching anime don't worry it'll be one of your best one. This has all sorts of emotions and it'll take you to a roller coaster ride. It is so motivational and breathtaking. It feels like you are watching a real match and words can't describe how much I am in love with this show. All I can say is \"woah\" whenever I watch this.. I personally can't binge anime for too long but this was my first show where I've binged it real hard. I would definitely recommend this show. What are you waiting for man? Go watch this show :).

But i also love other teams so it makes me sad when they lose<\\3 there's not enough words to explain how much i love this show. To make an anime about volleyball to be so interesting... furudate really is on another level. I owe him my life<\\3.",
        "I just love this show so much. I've watched more anime than most people in their 40s and this is hands down my favourite. Hinata is such a unique character, the way he improves everyone around him. The show says more about how to succeed than anything else I've ever seen. It just nails it - the attitude you need to bring out the best in others as well as yourself. It's also hilarious, a genuinely funny anime (for grown ups I mean). It's a show that just works on so many levels."

    "Kaiba": [
        "Created and directed by Masaaki Yuasa (Crayon Shin-Chan), Kaiba has been long on my list and I'm so glad I finally got to it, it was very fun. Following Warp in a futuristic dystopia where minds can be implanted into chips then moved from body to body (a la Altered Carbon), Kaiba's animation feels new and refreshing among the rest of its genre, and its surreal, abstract narratives fit perfectly in its art direction. For something gorgeous to watch with a good bit of philosophical thought behind it I would highly recommend this series, although would warn even with its friendly demeanour it is not a series for young kids, it does contain adult themes. Again, I loved the series, but the plot and meaning gets quite heady towards the end and the narrative of it all tends to fall apart. Something that's obviously deliberately abstract and opaque in its conclusions, I'm still struggling to exactly follow the overarching narrative and world building, but I'm sure there's a million \"Kaiba Explained\" videos out there. Similar to Evangelion, scoring this feels like grading the by far most talented kid in the class who unfortunately just didn't quite understand the assignment. Still would recommend, especially for fans of anime that haven't seen.",
        "It's hard to write a review of Kaiba. So much of its charm and beauty lies in the animation, the rough drawings and fluid movements of the characters. Madhouse and Masaaki Yuasa have gathered together some of the best animation talent around, and it shows -- the art is consistently strange and beautiful, and stands out in a tradition that's known for a very specific, very standardized art style.But that's just the surface. Underneath all that Kaiba is provocative, intelligent science fiction that questions the relationships between mind, bodies, and memories. Along the way it touches on love, family, the state and rebellion, providing nuanced portrayals of each. And it has a mythic arc that actually holds up to greater scrutiny.Tragic and uplifting in equal measure, Kaiba is not just one of the best anime series ever made but one of the best TV shows. It aired in obscurity and has yet to be licensed in the States, but looks for all the world like a big-budget production. It's rare in any medium or industry to see such a personal, idiosyncratic expression made at such great expense, and the show that emerged was every bit as miraculous as the events of its creation.",
        "The intro song will always make me sentimental. The visuals complimented with the song is just beautiful. The art style and animations are experimental, it's very unique. I haven't seen anything quite like it. You'll either find it interesting or you'll be put off by it. Right from the beginning the show pulls you into it's dystopian world without any context of anything and you have to figure out what's going on, and I loved that. I found it fascinating how surreal and otherworldly it looked, it reminded me a lot of Fantastic Planet. The soundtrack compliments the overall bizarre sci-fi tone of the show wonderfully. The storytelling is cleverly done and it's not afraid to get very creative with its ideas. The anime surprised me with how heavily spiritual and existential it was. It's beautifully human at its core. Each episode cleverly explores different themes pertaining to life, death, love, family, humanity, society, memories and much more. And the way this anime explores these different themes is something I've never seen done before, and it kind of blew my mind. I've never seen a piece of media that highlights how important and powerful our memories are like this one does.The idea of people's memories floating through space is both insane and also kind of sad. The fact that people are able to sell their physical bodies and memories to rich people is also sad and very wrong. How did they come up with all these ideas? Chroniko's story along with Negi's, her aunt, was probably the most tragic and memorable moment in the show. The way they showed all of their backstory within mere minutes and all through memory flashbacks was amazing. And the way they portrayed all of Negi's memories flooding in at once and her being overwhelmed by emotions was masterfully done. That screeching cry that Negi gives out when she recalls all her memories of her sister and Chroniko really hit hard, it definitely made me tear up. It reminded me of the things we do for family, the sacrifices we make because we care about them. Also made me think of how we try to forget about some of our past memories. Memories that might bring sadness, despair or anger and how impossible it is to avoid thinking about these memories. These memories always seem to find a way of creeping back into our consciousness. That definitely made me sentimental and opened up a wound. You would never expect it from this anime, but it's actually really sad and tragic. The good thing is that it never gets too bleak or dark.This is the part where I complain lol. So although I can respect the creative ideas for the character designs, I do have to say, personally, it's kind of hard for me to care about and get into them when they look so cartoony and childlike. Most of the main characters literally look like children, and its kind of off-putting to me. Everything else looks wonderfully conceptualized though; like the planets, the different species, the lore-based objects. It's also worth noting that the show looks more like a cartoon than an anime. The other complaint is that this show can be at times too surreal and abstract for my taste. I think the ideas and concepts that are presented are amazing and definitely thought-provoking, but sometimes the way that it's executed or the way they're portrayed can seem too farfetched at times. But with that being said, it was these different ideas, concepts and themes that kept me invested in the anime more than anything.Overall, Kaiba is a one-of-a-kind anime that comes once in a blue moon. If you're wiling to take the plunge into this bizarre, surreal and abstract world, you'll definitely be rewarded with a truly unique and thought-provoking experience. Definitely worth watching if you can get past the art style.",
        "Kaiba is an unusually animated anime. In fact it doesn't look like an anime at all. It looks more like a 1970s European cartoon with it's rounded shapes and distorted characters.The story takes place in a world and galaxy where a person's memory is encapsulated in a small cone shaped device that can be placed into the head of another body. Also, using a special ray gun a person can open and step into another person's memories. The story features a boy with no memory and a hole in his chest who finds himself being attacked by strange creatures for no apparent reason. With help from a few others, he has to figure out how to survive and who he is. It's one of those series that is hard to explain. You just have to watch it.",
        "Note: this is from a video review, look for links on my profile page.Kaiba is the visual type of sci-fi whose expositions are minimal, but relies on a more intuitive understanding of a possible world. It has this organic feeling, in that anything can grow anywhere, anyone can be any object. Perception is questioned, geometry limitless, but society is still very much familiar, as is often the case in this genre. Viewers' comprehension is baffled, but they try to juxtapose the puzzle any way. These, they learn, are artificial bodies, now a technology intrinsically.Can memories be blown away like the sands of time? How does hue, variance, temperature change our impression of a moment? Can mood be separated from feeling? How is darkness filled in by the void of the mind? What difference does background have, does the exterior have a relational countenance? Can one be blind to the actual, yet give in to illusory possibilities? Why does memory function differently in stages? Are analogies ever adequate? Is this a sphere or a jumbled mess of degrees? Is fire ever possible without oxygen? Why does one even assume darkness has no atmosphere?Is it to be assumed that flowers bloom on rocks? Would that be some sort of eel-snake amalgamation? Why at a micro level is there a practical reliance on the global scale? How could technology be anthropomorphized? Could the sociological descriptions of relations be that of mere substitutes? Is there 'intention' behind certain evolutionary traits to propagate? Survival depends on every possibility. But, from a personal, subjective perspective one values specific objects more or less, whether inanimated or still existent. Whichever plant this may be.What if distinct planets do end up with different cultures? What kind of physicality is preferable, would it be solely based on functionality? How would its shape change consciousness? Would gene modification even be involved with artificial objects? It doesn't seem necessary to sustain a plush toy. There certainly is the likelihood of an industry springing up to sustain this, though. Would society be fundamentally different, or would the only distinction be in appearance, limitlessly? Vanity would likely still be derived from the same source. But how could ears spawn creatures? And what if a human facet passed down to blobs of cells, or even evolved molluscs? In this world even cerulean centaurs can be an option, actualizing mythology. Cats invent artificiality with the aid of emoji interfaces. The contrast between light and darkness. A window of technological potentialities. A cartoon future devoid of universal familiarity.Is the cycle of life disrupted if indestructible mixtures are intertwined? Would it be possible for a flow of will to transition into a parallel continuation? Would it make a difference if it was fibre or protein? Are they the same electrical impulses that course through at different rates? Perhaps we could gauge the lapse of old age. Could the entirety of waking consciousness fit in some minuscule contraption? What would then be the difference between dolls - with eyes open - and ones where life inhabits? Could a blueprint exist for a perfect life?What role would colour play in a smoothly-flowing society? Would rhythm make any sense if shapes are indistinguishable? How much hedonism could groups at large sustain and for how long? Historically, not indefinitely. In this narrative personalities diverge, and even clones forge their own destiny. Memories are uncertain as they're essentially recreations based on the amygdala. History is a series of interactions between brains and egos.Technology, as shown in this anime, is often inspired by what nature ended up with in its random permutations. Water is as fluid as some machinery can be in navigating it. It plumbs the depths of some indistinct planet of indeterminate hue, just as it also delves into the subconscious role of memory and the psyche, abstractly.How does one perceive incoherent likeness? How unique is a mental state upon the moment of judgement? Kaiba shows, viewers question, but answers aren't necessarily forthcoming. A fog of arbitrariness permeate Masaaki's anime, it seems, and it appears functionally useful in a sci-fi narrative, to create a sense of unexpectedness associated with the unknown. It attempts to create an overarching world, analogous to Evangelion, but the slice-of-life elements are mostly what elevates it to the interest of psychology, at a more quintessential level, than the interpersonal.Kaiba can be a quirky, heightened experience with unusual art and a contemplative, inquisitive story that straddles the thresholds of dreams. The science fiction to Tatami Galaxy's romance.",
        "I love how this had some of the most original animation of any show I have seen, but most of all, this is one of my favorite sci fi shows. Even though some of the scifi concepts explored here are not original for today, it was very original for the time I think and for an anime it pretty much was pretty original. I don't like much japanese voice acting and I would say this show was more tolerable for my ears with subtitles. I had to watch this twice because I couldn't fully focus on the anime because of where I used to live, but it was worth it for me. There is hardly any guts so the blood which was colured not red for the most part is less intense than some shows. The ending made me feel mixed emotions more than any other show before and there could for sure be some conspiracies made about this show, but for the most part it's pretty straight forward if you read the subtitles well or if you know japanese. I also loved the ending and intro which are so far the only anime intros and outros I like fully. I am so glad I rewatched this show. The dvd is expensive (over 100 bucks) and I rember it's on the Amarican Amazon Prime too. I might check out more of Masaaki Yuasa's stuff some time, maybe not Cat Soup again though.",
        "Kaiba is a piece of art. This work by Masaaki Yuasa is a gem, the kind of which only few examples can be found in every art... We already owe to Studio Madhouse some of the finest animation works like Satoshi Kon's \"Paranoia Agent\" and \"Paprika\", Hiroshi Hamasaki's \"Texhnolyze\" and \"Shigurui\", Rintaro's \"Metropolis\" and many more. But with Masaaki Yuasa, Madhouse has discovered a true genius of this time and age.Kaiba is a poetic and philosophical tale packed with so much emotion and brilliantly imaginative conceptual and visual ideas, it is absolutely breathtaking. The graphical style reminds of Osamu Tezuka, the father of Japanese manga, but just as in the latter's work \"Phoenix\", the innocent, child-like drawings serve a deep and dense reflection about mankind and human condition.Revolving around the parallel concepts of time and loss, life and death, memories and oblivion, Kaiba succeeds in creating a whole coherent universe, characterized by its overwhelming melancholy. It is truly comforting to see that such ambitious and groundbreaking projects can still see the light of day today, regardless of their chances at commercial success. Thank you Masao Maruyama, co-founder of Madhouse studio and producer of the series, for having made Kaiba happen!It will be so hard for Kaiba to find its public, a million miles away from commercial animated series that most of time have little to offer to the heart and mind... While art lovers have long learned to distinguish between meaningless blockbusters and personal independent cinema, Japanese animation hasn't yet achieved to be widely considered in its diversity, even in Japan.Kaiba is pure art and emotion, a brilliant masterpiece and a unique experience that will leave an everlasting imprint in its viewers' heart."

    "Eureka Seven": [
        "I liked this show enough to watch it all in a few days, but I warn you from the start not to expect too much. The main emotional hooks are adolescent love, respect for one's father, group friendship and saving the planet from military insanity (always a Japanese favourite). Of course a lot of people felt connected to the show.However, these hooks cover a pretty childish thing. You don't have that silly toilet humour or exaggerated emotional faces (except in the first episodes), but just about everybody in the show does whatever they feel like. It's not that they maintain a state of chaos, but that's because they also have feelings of honor, loyalty or respect. The few parts when somebody does something because it is smart to do it don't really affect the flow of the story.So basically this is a variation of \"The one\", mixed with a little Gaia theory and slowly going towards \"The two\" :)One can learn the following from Eureka 7 (why 7? I have no idea): 1. You don't want children. 2. If you see children on the battlefield, all crying and innocent, kill them. 3. Adolescents aren't much better either. 4. Old people are cool if they raise you then you never meet them again.OK, seriously now: nice animation, but I wouldn't call it great, silly music (aren't there nice Japanese songs anywhere except by Kenji Kawai?), interesting alternate world until they mess it up, nice story, but way too emotional, very little Mecha (the fights are sketchy and uninteresting). Favourite character: Norbu, the monk!",
        "Renton Thurston is a 14 year old kid who lives in a town at a garage with his grandfather. In this town nothing good happens and Reton has a dream to do a cut back drop turn like his Holland. A beautiful alien girl arrives called Eureka arrives on the planet with the rest of Gecko state and they recruit Renton with them and they embark one some epic adventures. While fighting some baddies in this mecha/KLF called the nervase.This series has 50 episodes total with 4 awesome seasons. What I really like about this show is that it is not just your typical mecha and robot anime, it carries out story arcs about what the characters were doing before they joined Gecko state, and how most of them change in character from beginning to the end for better or worse purposes. While as a weakness there is not that much actions in most episodes, but in some episodes this is kinda my favorite arc it sort of teaches morals and lessons like why running away is the key to solving your problems and how you can learn from past mistakesThe music was really good, i actually liked all 4 intros it had a long side any background music so it doesn't feel like some generic mecha anime. The ending credits music was also good despite the last one being a step down from the other ones.This anime is more suited to older audiences as there is a lot of violence, imagery which may seem terrifying for younger audiences and even drug dosing.The voice cast of the dub is very solid Johnny Yong Bosch did a good job voicing our young and winny protagonist and he doesn't seem to be trying too hard to voice him like one reviewer here claimed he was, sure he might have not been the first but at least he sounds like the characters unlike the japanese which who made him sound like a 5 year old and still male sounding unlike his animax voice. In fact Yuri Lowanthal was originally meant to voice him but then Bandia decided his voice was too high pitch so they casted JYB, lucky though in episode 7 an archived dialogue can be heard briefly. The other voice actors including Stephanie Sheh, Crispin Freeman, Kate Higgins, Jessica Straaus, Steve Staley, Peter Doyle, Megan Hollingshead, Kirk Thornton, Bob Papenbrook (RIP: this was his final project before he passed away), Kyle Hebert, Kim Stass, Kari Walgren, Peggy O Neal, Mary Elizabeth Glen and Tony Oliver (Director aswell) did a good job as their roles. My only disappointment was they did not honour Bob Papenbrock last episode in his name but other than that it was a pretty sold dub.If you want anime with cool fighting scenes, backstories, sci-fi and a bit of drama I strongly recommend this anime.",
        "While it ends up being a good mecha anime, it has one major drawback. Renton. I nearly stopped watching this because I couldn't stand listening to this whiny little idiot. Being a young teenage protagonist, some situations and attitudes are to be expected. This guy was one of the more annoying I've come across. If they would have written him a bit more bearable, I would have rated this at least another star. Maybe two. Definitely worth watching, just be warned this kid was extra hard to watch in a lot of the episodes.",
        "In a dystopian world, the teenage son of a famous man winds up joining rebels against a repressive regime, becoming the co-pilot of a strange young woman's mecha.ReviewAnd now, on the heels of Stig and Tim's review of Captain Earth, here's its predecessor from the same studio (BONES), and while it has some of the same weaknesses as its descendant- and both share certain weaknesses with other mecha and sci-fi shows- overall, I enjoyed Eureka Seven a great deal, mainly on the strength of its supporting cast and some of its underlying themes.As for that cast, I found its eccentricity a delightful change of pace. In so many shows (e.g., Last Exile) even the rebel forces operate in military uniforms and under military discipline. Eureka's cast is actually trying to get away from that (you'll see why), and is in fact about as motley a crew as you'll ever meet. (An A+ for Eureka's character art; the characters' faces and physiques are very distinctively rendered.) They dress however they please- mostly extremely casually, though when one character wants to be taken more seriously she actually adopts military dress. (Gotta confess I liked her original outfit, too- I guess one never quite outgrows being a fanboy.)In fact, most of the crew dresses in \"surfer casual\", and the show's use of surfing and surfer culture is a core concept, a silly one yet undeniably distinctive. (Characters even have surfer names like Gidget and Moondoggie.) The world of Eureka is one of \"seismic shifts\", where \"trapars\" generate currents in the atmosphere that allow \"lifting\" (flight by sky-boarding.) The saturation of the show with a plethora of poorly-explained concepts (poorly explained despite a ton of verbal exposition, I might add) sounds a lot like Stig and Tim's take on Captain Earth, so bad habits die hard, apparently, and there are numerous logical problems here; for example, (1) if there are lifting currents in the atmosphere, wouldn't it affect the surface atmospheric pressure?, and (2) not only the people, but everyone's mechas (both good guys and bad) also ride on sky boards, which would seem to be a big problem in a wipeout. Only a single pair of villains has come up with the obvious solution, it seems. (A digression: that pair of \"villains\"- the Beams- are two of the most nuanced \"evil\" characters I've ever seen, and I can certainly understand our teenage hero's difficulty in deciding who was the better ethical choice- them, or the rebels he had been previously traveling with.) And yet for all its improbability, I still preferred Eureka's surf culture (the rebels even publish their own fanzine about their exploits, nice touch) to the steampunk style of, for example, Last Exile. (Steampunk is Sci-Fi as the Victorians might have imagined it, but those Last Exile troops dressed in 18th-Century military uniforms firing muskets (!) from the decks of airships somehow strained my credulity even more than Eureka does.) But one would nevertheless STILL prefer to have certain of Eureka's issues and concepts more completely addressed, especially the ones connected to the mushy metaphysics of slovenly priest Master Norb. What the heck IS the \"Limit of Questions\", and why does reaching it cause the end of the universe? What is the exact cause of the hallucinatory stuff that our young hero and heroine (still not gotten to them, but I'm working on it) experience, and what does all the symbolic imagery in it mean? Again, there's PLENTY of talk about all this, and yet for all that it's much less efficient in actually orienting the viewer to the history, culture, and mechanics of its world than what other shows achieve with much less exposition (but even more bizarre settings!), like Simoun and Noein.Our crew of rebels, calling their ship the Gekko, and collectively referring to themselves as the Gekkostate, nevertheless DO have a leader, named Holland. He's driven by stubborn pride and self-righteousness (in other words, he's a complete jerk), and physically violent as well toward our young hero, who is just waiting in the wings for me to describe him. But Holland is often under tremendous pressure to alter his (frequent) bad calls by other members of the crew- the Gekkostate's crewmembers apparently are more like independent contractors than military subordinates (as I've heard was actually true of the crews of pirate ships.) Holland's apparently had (and continues to have) some difficulties with women (must be his charming personality), though he has a long-standing casual thing with the ship's pilot, named Talho; she sleeps with him, but there's some longstanding dispute between them, which we'll eventually learn the substance of. It's made her generally cranky and sometimes harsh, and she takes it out on our young male hero, who I've so far mainly mentioned as a target of abuse without naming him. But I LOVE Talho; she's had to be an Iron Lady type to endure her situation, and sometimes had to actually take command when Holland was incapacitated- or when he'd made some particularly boneheaded decision. Things get better for her as one issue finally gets publicly aired (and settled), and as she comes to terms with the settlement of this, and with another personal issue of hers as well, she begins to blossom as a character. She's become one of my favorite anime females of all time. And I really love the show's recurring theme that NO ONE is too old to grow.(Just thought I'd throw this in: the Gekkostate mainly gets by through smuggling and doing mercenary work for various parties persecuted by the government, particularly the Vodarac, a religious sect. One episode has some very still-timely things to say about persecuting whole religions for the actions of some of their members.)I thought I'd NEVER get to Renton Thurston, and I bet you thought I never would, too. He's 14, his parents are (supposedly) dead, and his elder sister departed on some journey long ago, leaving him in the care of his grandfather, who's trained him in his trade of mechanic. Renton had been following the Gekkostate fanzine, and when a young woman from Gekkostate named Eureka wants Renton's grandfather to fix her mecha, Renton winds up with Holland and company. Things turn sour after a while, partly due to a matter related to the bad blood between Holland and Talho, and partly due to an epiphany Renton has about the business he's become involved in, and this leads to Renton going adrift, being unable to find the best path to follow for a time. But he finally does find a path to follow- the one trod by Eureka. Renton struck me as an interesting contrast to Evangelion's Shinji. To be honest, my knowledge of Evangelion is based on the first few chapters of the anime for the beginning, The End of Evangelion for the end, and the manga (I know, different from the anime) for the middle part; I've not seen the reboot, etc. Yet from what I DID see, Shinji seemed like a character who had almost no \"arc\", a kid who was unable to grow and overcome the flaws in his own character despite the examples, and sacrifices, of others. Renton, on the other hand, comes onto the Gekko with an idealistic personality, and still manages to find something to believe in even when his idealism gets stomped several times. Of course, what he comes to believe in is Eureka.Eureka herself (the Japanese VA's pronounce it more like \"Erica\") is drawn with short green hair, is alone among her Gekkostate comrades in almost always wearing a uniform (hilariously, the one time she wears a dress, it exactly matches the colors and styling of her uniform), and comes across as someone with very poor social skills- she's very reserved, never seems quite sure how to react in human conflicts, and in fact seems kind of lost a lot of the time. She relates much better to machines (and to her mecha, the Nirvash, in particular) than to other humans. Fans of Evangelion (and of a lot of other Sci-Fi animes) will immediately recognize these red flags that There's Something Weird About This Girl. And indeed there is. Even though we receive more than a hint of just what that weirdness is, I was still somewhat surprised when it was formally revealed. One of the interesting things the show does is create, on the villains' side, exact counterparts of Renton and Eureka (you could call them the anti-Renton and anti-Eureka) in Dominic Sorel, and Anemone (she's a literal \"red\" to Eureka's \"green.) There's no telling what will become of you if you cast your lot with a weird girl- and this applies here on BOTH sides of the divide between good and evil- and I was watching in anticipation of what would become of our guys and their \"troublesome ladies\", as Dominic aptly puts it. There's plenty of growing strangeness ahead (particularly for Eureka), and a more general threat to their world also vexes our young couples and their allies.Some will find the show's slow pace exasperating (it's especially dilatory toward the end), it gets maudlin in places (again, especially late in the series), has too little real explanation in spite of its verbiage, and the whole \"surfing\" concept is a bit goofy; on the other hand, some of the characters, and their interactions, are nearly perfectly conceived, and the show is often \"adult\" in the GOOD way (even if Renton, and even more so Eureka, are ing\u00e9nues.) It's also a bit less grim, maybe even more optimistic, than many similar Sci-Fi shows, and that's not a bad thing either, as far as I'm concerned. In the first version of this review I expressed concern that by \"marathoning\" the series I might have missed some things, but discovered that others found that with its slow pace, marathoning the show helped them keep their interest. In any event, l loved so many of the people here and so much of their story that for me it's Four Stars. - Allen Moody",
        "There are several subjects in this series, the war, the racism, the growth of children, the love and even the politics and use of populism.It is pretty instructive, pity that the language is direct so in some countries they tried rise the ratings, in my opinion it is fine for 14+.It is perfect but from very small parts, negligible, for example the Tip Taps Tip ending theme: I can understand you tell me it is some kind of art, but it is anyway not the type in line with the series.",
        "Eureka seven concerns the journey of Renton Thurston from an ordinary 14 year old living in the shadow of his deceased hero father to a key member of Gekko-State, a sort of mobile micronation aboard a flying ship. His journey begins when a mecha (known as an LFO) crashes and its pilot emerges requesting help from Renton's grandfather. The pilot, it turns out, is a beautiful young girl, named Eureka (hence the name of the series) that Renton finds himself instantly enamored with. However, battle soon breaks out and the mecha take to the air, riding a substance known as trapar on a kind of surfboard (a concept which pervades the show). Sent to deliver a special device known as the Amita drive to Eureka, Renton finds himself caught in the greatest adventure of his life.Things do not go well for Renton, however. The captain of the Gekko-State, Holland, does not get along with Renton for much of the series, even hitting him a few times. The Gekko-State itself is in conflict with the United Federation, which controls the planet and frequently sends surfing mecha LFOs of its own to do battle with it. Dealing with the conspiring Dewey and the jelly-slurping antithesis of Eureka, Anemone, as well, the people of Gekko State sure have their hands full. It seems Dewey has some issues with the mysterious Coralians and intends to wipe them out.Despite this imaginative setting, Eureka Seven suffers from a strongly derivative quality at times. Eureka herself makes one wonder if a clone of Rei Ayanami didn't escape from NGE (apart from her pallid complexion and Spockish demeanor, she does not dream, she experiences a bizarre transformation at the end, even sprouting wings, and so on). Additionally, the series features the obligatory Mysterious Mecha that Aren't Really Mecha, the strange psychological sequences, and quasi-Apocalyptic quality made famous in Eva and copied by shows like RahXephon.This derivative quality (along with the rather slow pace of the show which contains a slew of filler episodes, especially early on) is why I only gave it a six even though it improved greatly as it progressed, though I think even that might be too generous. Some have called such comparisons to Eva superficial and tell me to look at how these copied ideas are used to make a point rather than the fact that they are copied. I have looked for a point, but alas, a commercial concerning Eureka Seven has already shown me the purpose of the series: to sell mecha action figures.",
        "I'm not much into romance or mecha, but I don't have anything against those genres either and I read such great reviews for this series that I decided to not pass the opportunity in watching this.I unfortunately let the fans get to me. Whether you liked this show or not, a lot of reviewers will point out that the first half is fairly slow, I could deal with that, believe it or not, I thought the first half of the show was better (not a popular opinion, and by better I mean OK at best). As the series goes on to the second half, the plot get's more interesting, and also, makes less and less sense. This is probably the show's biggest problem. Things such as strange fish-like monsters summoned (somehow?) out of no where killing random people, some strange purple goo that hurts people, an old guy who has something implanted in his chest and is able to control the mechs known as LFOs, and more unexplained things that will easily infuriate viewers. The main cast of characters are in a group known as the Gekkostate, a lot of the times, you won't really know what the characters are doing because it is so poorly explained. Most of the characters aren't that good, some aren't so bad. The main character Renton can get annoying with all his whining, but he isn't all that bad seeing that he has some likable attributes. Talho and Holland were actually decent characters as the series went on. Eureka on the other hand has hardly any personality at all (typical Rei clone), half of her lines are comprised of \"Oh, Renton\" or \"Nirvash, please!\", or her just crying and then staring without emotion. The kids that Eureka takes care of are extremely annoying. The main antagonist Dewey Novak' motives aren't really that clear and what happens to him at the end isn't explained. Almost all the other characters serve no purpose other than just being there. Take Dominic and Anemone, they only exist to fill time and to add another couple to the story. I hear a lot of people say that complaints like this just means \"you didn't get the message man\". Yes, there were themes of love and family, but it was hard to care seeing that I head a love-hate feeling towards Renton, while Eureka was very boring. The only characters I cared about were Holland and Talho and that was pretty much it. I ended up skipping a majority of the second half of the show just to watch the end. That ending... was so terribly cheesy, I won't say anything to avoid spoilers but it was one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen in my life. On the other hand I have no complaints about animation, it was very well done and it was hard not to like, the voice acting wasn't bad either (except Eureka who got annoying sometimes). I'm not saying this is one of the worst anime, but I certainly wouldn't call it a good one. If you enjoyed this series, that's fine, but I really can't see how.",
        "Most Americans are conditioned from birth to think \"animation=cartoons=kidstuff.\" Those who know better won't even need this review, but for those who are just discovering that animation can carry dramatic and imaginative themes as well as any other medium, I'm going to make a few observations about Eureka 7 -- a somewhat underrated gem even within its own genre.To begin with, this is no kiddie show. Yes, it's told from the standpoint of an adolescent protagonist, but then, so are Kidnapped, Catcher in the Rye and Oliver Twist. Renton's journey from naive and somewhat bratty boy to mature young man is gradual, entirely plausible, ultimately engaging and just as full of hard knocks as Real Life.And it's certainly not kid stuff. There's deadly violence aplenty, real emotional conflict and (in the fansubbed version I saw, anyway) enough foul language to fill an army barracks. The gritty world of Eureka 7 is no jolly romp, either for Renton or for the crew of the renegade airship he falls in with.Nor does the crew of the Gekkostate -- itself stolen from the militaristic Federation -- bear any resemblance to Robin Hood's Merry Men. They're a gang of moody misfits, all of them nursing some personal grudge against the world and all too often ready to take it out on the new kid who can't fight back. And as if young Renton doesn't have enough trouble fitting in with this surly pirate crew, there's the enigmatic Eureka, beautiful but distant and inarticulate. She's surrounded by mystery, and as we gradually find out, it's nothing simple, either. Renton is fascinated by Eureka and utterly devoted to her, and in spite of her flaws, it's not hard to see why. She's both hard-as-nails tough and at the same time utterly vulnerable, and hence irresistible to a romantic like Renton. If any fictional heroine was worthy of the emotional and physical hard knocks that poor Renton endures, it's Eureka.Don't expect to be pulled into Eureka 7 by watching one or two episodes, any more than you'd judge a Dickens novel by the first few pages. Give it a chance and let the epic-length (50 chapters) story weave itself around you. Once the complex characters and their interlocking motivations begin to spin themselves out, you'll be hooked. Eureka 7 is like a richly textured book that well rewards the reader for entering its world.Oh, and don't be put off by the \"giant robots,\" either. The mecha are roughly the equivalent of a combination tank and fighter plane in Eureka 7's world, and they have a humanoid shape for a very good reason, as you'll see.For gorgeous animation, beautiful music (I recommend listening to it with a good pair of stereo headphones), three-dimensional characters and a genuinely moving story, you just can't beat Eureka 7. Anyone who can overcome a deep-seated prejudice against \"cartoons\" is going to be introduced to a whole new world with this series.And by the way, let's also clear up the common stereotype that Japanese anime is only for the high-school set. I'm 59 and I find Princess Mononoke and Steamboy to be among the best movies ever made in any medium. And Eureka 7 hooked me from the start.Eureka 7 is addictive, and rightfully so. Get your fix now, and find out what you're missing.",
        "I'm rather picky when it comes to animes, japans cultural differences with storytelling irk me a bit while watching a series... I have a lot of respect for these shows, but it takes a special something for me to try one out.this show, hands down, has the best style and artwork direction I've ever seen- its jaw droppingly beautiful animation, fantastic character and vehicle design, awesome effects- everything is aesthetically spot on. I love the expressions especially.Im a graphic designer and illustrator by profession, so i tend to pay attention to colour schemes, designs and the like... i had to rewind a bit of the episode so i could catch the dialogue rather than study the posters in Rentons room... Im totally hooked by the details of this show.And hey, the story and dialogue has me impressed so far as well, some really good back and forth. Im only 3 episodes in and plan on finishing all 50 in the next couple days, sleep? phooey on sleeping.watch it.",
        "I've only been a fan of anime for 1-2 years now, the first show i watched being Fullmetal Alchemist. It was after that show that I moved on to Inuyasha, Black Lagoon, Blood +.....and then Eureka Seven. The emotions I felt and the Beauty I witnessed is nearly indescribable. The show is action-packed, funny, superbly and colorfully animated, dramatic, heart wrenching, and, above all, powerfully romantic.I have never been on the verge of tears so often in a series as I was during Eureka Seven, and by the end of episode 50 i was nearly bawling. Eureka and Renton's relationship isn't just companionship, affection, and caring; it's TRUE love. It's the kind of love we don't see often enough in our day and age, the kind of love you can only dream of. It's endearing, unfaltering, gorgeous, true love. Their relationship is the most beautiful thing I have to yet to witness in a story, movie, or television show in my 19 years of life. AH! And it's conclusion: I'll never forget it. I believe that Eureka Seven will always hold a place in my heart. The emotions, the colors, the loyalty, the destiny, the LOVE: It all fuses to make one very, very perfect show. Watch Eureka Seven. May it affect you the way it did me. May you be lost in it's beauty.P.S. - It ended perfectly........but we need a second season. Even an OVA will suffice. It ended appropriately, but I believe that every fan can agree: WE NEED MORE EUREKA SEVEN.",
        "The first time I watched Eureka Seven, I was in a mood of \"meh, this is going to suck,\" it didn't but I definitely didn't love it either. After watching the first two episodes and failing to be interested enough to continue, I forgot about it. Some weeks later, on a forum I regularly visit, people were gushing over it. I was wondering what the hell they were on about; they reassured me that it got better and better and better and better\u0085.and then even better. \"Mecha just isn't my thing\" I said \"especially when said mecha rides on lame surfboards through the sky\". WRONG. The mecha aspect is such a miniscule part of the show that placing it into that anime genre is a crime against humanity. Instead the show becomes one of the most compelling dramas I've ever seen, anime or not. So yes I continued to watch, the next few episodes were nothing special, humorous in parts, interesting in others. I was growing impatient waiting for an arc to form. And then it happened and everything changed, by episode 30 I was proclaiming Eureka Seven as the best anime I've ever had the pleasure of watching and by the end of it all, Eureka Seven had solidified it's place in anime history as possibly the most beautifully written anime ever.So what is it about it that makes Eureka Seven so refreshing and wonderful? For starters it's nothing like the general mecha anime, if you look at all of them, they are all named after the mecha: Rahxephon, Evangelion, Gundam etc. Eureka Seven set itself up from the very beginning as a character drama and by naming it after the main female character they achieved this. Eureka Seven is all about the characters. Occasionally there are no mecha battles for episodes at a time, when there is one, they are there to compliment the story and the characters own development. At first I felt Renton was rather annoying and I continually found myself saying \"shut up\" allowed, whenever he was on screen, however by the end Renton had undergone such an excellently written change, he wasn't the annoying kid anymore he was instead one of the most endearing male leads in any anime I have ever seen. Technically Eureka Seven is an achievement. Every aspect, the music, the animation does its job with finesse. The music by Sato Naoki is superb and at time compels you to tears in even some of the happiest most uplifting of scenes. It weaves itself into the anime and never feels out of place. The animation is mostly consistent but at time it drops in quality, however the high level of art is maintained throughout. The arcing story is always interesting and doesn't fall into boring clich\u00e9s and contrivances which plague most anime today. The writers indict war and it's meaningless with beautiful tact and subtlety. The mysteries are well told and answers are littered throughout, a lot of them leaving the viewer to ponder over and think about, rather than having them shoved in your face.Sadly Eureka Seven has slipped under most peoples radars; brushing it off as the same thing I felt it was when I first watched it. Fullmetal Alchemist another offering from Bones animation Studio has managed to make a dent in the anime community, even though I liked that anime quite a bit it pales in comparison to Eureka Seven. Hopefully as word of mouth spreads Eureka Seven will find itself as widely acclaimed as it deserves to be.Eureka Seven is what every anime, no every TV show aspires to be, something original, intriguing and always fun. It's a rarity to have such a uniquely told story that is full of lovable characters and wondrous technical achievements. Eureka Seven is the best anime of 2005. No, the best anime in years.",
        "Eureka Seven is a series that I've fallen in love with and, consequently, it's crept into my favourites like someone who doesn't want the thing. The mime with which Tomoki Kyoda and company have treated the series is spectacular and can be seen in the number of awards with which the work has been awarded. Similarly, the work of the animators around the home stretch is very much to be thanked. But what has left me in awe is not precisely the outstanding technical section, but rather what they have all contributed their grain of sand to bring it to life: the story of Renton and Eureka, two boys who will face the world to make their love a reality verified and lived.The story begins with the school life of Renton Thurston, the son of legendary hero Adroc Thurston. There will be those to whom the tranquility and even the monotony are bearable or even to thank, but for Renton it is simply a disgust. His grandfather and legal guardian wants him to become a mechanic of his stature and lead a happy and peaceful life, without the complicated circumstances of his father's death or his sister's disappearance. But the boy, partly because of the irresponsibility inherent in his age, does not settle for so little; he wants to go to unexplored lands. Places that offer him a never-before-seen rag with which to ref boarding aboard impressive waves.I hope that, together with the admiration he feels for the prodigy Holland, it will lead him to meddle in Gekkostate, a dangerous gang composed of little less than terrorists in the eyes of the government. In other words, in this particular case, people willing to break the law for the greater good: the good of humanity, of the planet and of everything that inhabits it.There he will meet Eureka, a girl who is a bit out of standard and who Renton thinks of as his better half. But before she gets along with the above and becomes an essential part of Gekkostate and the piloting of Nirvash, she must acquire discipline and understand that the Gekko-Go ship is not a place to come surfing and flirting with girls. Leaving aside the three children who swarm around for good reason, everyone is dedicated to carrying the heavy burden of being criminals, killing people, and why not, supporting illegal organ trafficking if the situation requires it.Enlisting in Gekkostate is not turkey snot, but at the very least an accomplice to murder, and that's something Renton didn't seem to understand when he joined the party, which will promptly lead him to change his fighting style after realizing the obviousness that, behind the machines he smashes aboard Nirvash, there are people with family, friends and loved ones.Renton's development is therefore a long one; the passage from a child who knows nothing to an adult capable of turning his promises into deeds. A step that, as far as destiny or Eureka is concerned, takes some pauses. Behind the girl there is a past, a reason for being, and an identity that has nothing to do with her morphology.\nEureka's unique look at her clothes (or more precisely, the necklace she wears on her neck) showed that she was not an ordinary girl, but rather something extremely artificial that she did not understand much about others. Her existence was summed up as that of a puppet who did not understand the scope of her actions and killed as ordered. To feel alive, to miss or to love someone are things that caught him far away, even if in the eyes of the children he orphaned she is a kind of adoptive mother.But meeting Renton was a start for her in appreciating life and the value implicit in it. On the other side of the spectrum, this led her to also understand the atrocities behind the hundreds of deaths she has caused, and that is that understanding the meaning of life is intimately linked to assimilating the evil of murder.This will lead some members of Gekkostate to consider whether they have the slightest right to live and be happy in the new world for which they are fighting and risking their lives. Not in vain is the Gekko-Go a bloodstained ship, both inside and out.In any case, Eureka Seven doesn't go around fighting from here to there in what people reflect on morality and ethics. There is no doubt that together with comedy, very well measured and implanted, it is an incentive that gives a certain diversity and substance to the work. The battles are of such magnitude that it would not be much less rare to see Eureka Seven because of the morbidity of seeing gigantic machines give each other hosts in what they surf through the skies. But they are components that, like the socio-political conflict, are in the background and lead the characters to what will be their next difficulty.The fact that Nirvash requires two pilots to extract its full potential is by no means the surplus of time. And the shots are not going to make the cockpit of the wick a motel where people get on all fours and exchange morreos to tutipl\u00e9n, the purest style of Darling in the FranXX.On the contrary, the need for the Nirvash to be piloted by two people (and therefore present two holes since it was conceived as an archetype) is the need for the Coral Scub to understand and communicate with humanity through Eureka. It is forcing crosses of gaze, sometimes uncomfortable but necessary talks, and a teamwork for which the relationship between the two must be in good condition.Thus, what prevails above all else are the ties between characters, especially when there is romantic interest involved. Not in vain is love the main axis of the work. That which leaves the world in the background to focus almost exclusively on the feelings of its characters and give them an excuse with which, leaving the universe itself to the garete, jump into the void in search of their better half. That which makes the End of Anemone the Beginning of many things, to highlight its torrid romance.",
        "I love this anime so much that I cry every time I watch it. This absolute masterpiece of a drama is a shining example of what other anime and film should strive for. It is to good to pass up, watch it.",
        "I have now seen a lot of animes (short series, long series, movies, OVAs), Eureka 7 was next on schedule. After seeing the first few episodes, the strange world of E7 coupled with surfing mechas worried me a little bit, because i was used to this fact (FLCL, TTGL,.. got also very good after seeing some episodes), but knowed, that although getting into it is quite a work.However, i continued watching it, until to realize, that this anime has very intelligent and matured characters and the same goes for the humor. E7 has also good battles which are different from other mecha series, because there is always a focus on beautiful and colorful locations which impressed me, because of this powerful atmosphere of the pictures combined with one of the best score i have ever heard in animes.But then, after some episodes, i suddenly checked it: Eureka 7 is a lot, but its true nature is to be the most dramatically breath-taking, heart-touching love story i have ever experienced not only from animes, from all media in my life!This tremendous tension, which is build up from episode to episode, embedded in a amazingly captivating story, will not end until the last second.Do not compare it with other animes, it is not comparable. Its a masterpiece which stands, because of its originality, far away from everything else, therefore don't expect another Neon Genesis (epic story and mechas) or fullmetal alchemist. E7 is with its amazing picture language a shiny piece of art and art is the way the story is told, the characters are growing and the background music is written.All this facts melt into the fate of Eureka and Renton, the main protagonists of this anime, which, in a now-time of superlative-language, has no fitting word left for explanation. But when you are not cold blooded and have no hamburger instead of a heart, then you tears will drop on multiple scenes of the series (and especially at episode 26).Do you self a favor and GO WATCH THIS. One hint: E7 has such a fantastic background music, which is so important for the atmosphere. Watch it with a lot of bass or take good earphones! And do it loud!",
        "This anime has a surprising story that goes through all 50 episodes from start to end. To be understood it would be better to see it over only a few days not 50 weeks as i did this past weekend even if I had already seen it before. It helps the story as a whole because you get to see it evolve without forgetting what happened a few episodes back. It teaches quite a few things if you look a bit deeper in the story, like about religions, how people can be different and still be in love and more. It is simply a must see not as anime but as a series instead because it isn't like most anime its got a beautiful love story as well as a whole package encircling it.I love many different kind of animes but having seen this one again put it way up my favorite list, but still won't miss naruto or any other shows i like!",
        "This is quite an interesting anime. The characters and emotions felt are top notch and have few equals. Watching Renton and Eureka is quite inspiring and truly lets the audience consider what love should feel like. If for nothing else but this candid and heartfelt captivation the anime deserves a watch. However, it had faults, some of which were too glaring to be forgotten. The plot essentially has two halves one was really fantastic ( the story of coralians and the earth etc. I won't say too much to spoil it for any of you). Sadly, the other half of the story, the antagonists or big bad guys are DRASTICALLY lacking. The motivations behind Dewie Novak (the supposed head honcho) are comparable to that of a serial killer in a \"B\" horror movie. This really becomes apparent toward the ending. That's another big complaint I had, the ending was undoubtedly rushed. The last 5 episodes felt horribly compact and blitzed, leaving many strings hanging. Now you may hear this and think I'm the kind of person who just hates strings, well I don't... but this show just unraveled the whole ball of yarn and flung it around the room. The ending was not a complete catastrophe though, the 2 protagonists got an ambiguous yet appropriate ending. There really just should have been at least 1 more episode. All in all this is a terrific anime, better than most. It won't raise many questions about life, and if you're looking for something like FMA, move along. If you're looking for a refreshing intelligent story about the power of true love, then you've hit gold.",
        "Eureka Seven is a story about a boy, a boy who is bored with his life and town, his name is Renton Thurston he is 14 years old. Renton Dreams of one day he can become a member of the Gekkostate a anti-government militia and counterculture collective led by Holland Novak.

        "Truly one of the greatest things ever created. The plot is revealed as the story goes deeper. The viewer discovers reasons and meanings as they are revealed to Renton. By the end of the series the viewer is able to understand things from the beginning that were a mystery. Psalms of the Planets Eureka Seven has excellent character development. I was moved to love all the characters and their final stages of development. I bought all 12 volumes before i was finished watching the series, and i can say now that that was a decision i won't regret. I am really looking forward to the movie Pocketful of Rainbows. This series is 1250 minutes of your life NOT wasted. check it out.",
        "Allow me to begin by saying this - the beginning of Eureka 7 may not necessarily show it, it may seem more average than extraordinary, but this program is brilliant. I implore you, whoever you may be, to watch past episode 10. Perhaps, like I did, you will fall head-over-heels in love.The reasons I fell in love were these - deep, realistic characters, striking originality, beautiful animation, and fascinating relationships, specifically the slowly, subtly growing romance between Renton and Eureka. Eureka 7 may be full of strange, fantastical, half-explained things, but its realism is still striking. What I mean is this - by blending genres seamlessly, it has all the subtle emotional shades of real life. Its balance of characters is likewise perfect, and the animators never stoop to laziness or shortcuts. In the background of every episode, variegated skies glow and strange landscapes stand. Additionally, with the exception of perhaps two or so episodes, this anime has no filler - every episode is meaningful and develops plot or relationships. Another positive is the choice of which scenes to represent, which never seems to fail (and I think is instrumental in the success of the show). To finish my raving list of positives, I add this: even the ending and opening themes are beautiful.I assure you, Eureka 7 is the best romance-action-adventure-drama, the best coming-of-age-slice-of-life-mecha-comedy you will ever see (smile), and perhaps even the best television show, live or animated, ever made. It is a show sparkling and shimmering with all the complex, difficult beauty of real life, shining with the light of hope and idealism, filled with all the sorrow and happiness of first love.",
        "Eureka 7 seizes the day as my favorite story of all time. I've seen and loved many of the great anime: Full Metal Alchemist, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Death Note, Dragonball Z, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Rurouni Kenshin. Yet if I were to give any anime my heart, I'd give it to Eureka 7 (and rightfully so, because it did win it, when the other ones could only come close).From the first episode I knew that I was in for something wonderful. Enigmatic is the essence of this bright yet dramatic story -- from the characters, to the setting, the plot, music, art, and dialogue. Every aspect is just so beautiful, especially Renton and Eureka's (the two main characters') relationship -- it captures the heart of young love (no pun intended, honestly) and melds in the very grim consequences of the war they have found themselves in. But despite the hardships Renton and Eureka endure, and despite Renton's realization of what Eureka actually is, the love between them bonds them forever.Eureka 7 is the story that speaks to me. Everything just fits perfectly together into a mosaic of story and soul.My final recommendation is to take the time and watch at least 5 episodes. It's a story that ages like wine; each episode is better than the last. I hope you enjoy Eureka 7 as much as I have.",
        "I can't speak highly enough of Eureka Seven. Of the little TV I have time to watch, it's at the top of the list. There's something about the crafting of the characters that draws you in slowly and effortlessly. I started watching the show because of the high quality of the animation; now I'm completely hooked because I care about people in the story. And that's part of what is so beautiful about the series \u0096 the characters do become people, people you start to care about and want to see again. Like all good anime (Cowboy Bebop, Gunslinger Girls, Ghost in the Shell) and all good stories, the characters grow and define themselves, and that journey sucks you in and leaves you wanting more.If you look around at reviews, you will see criticisms of the series \u0096 most of these boil down to \"not enough robot battles\", or too wishy-washy with adolescent love, or some other pick at one of the many minor themes. These jabs all miss the point though. The story is really about love and family. We are reminded of how difficult love and family can be, how they change and define us, and how very much they are worth all of that effort. I'll wrap this comment up before I get too sappy. Just watch Eureka Seven. I can honestly say it is my favorite story in years. It's a fairy tale, but sometimes we need fairy tales to help us make sense of the world.",
        "It's like 10years behind, I still remember Eureka, the whole story was attractive especially the music in this, where the moment just right.",
        "Being an fan of anime and especially the writer Dai Sato(creator of samurai champloo,cowboy bebop)I've seen many shows and truth be told there are few shows that really make you go 'wow'!. This is one of those shows, most shows end either too early or carry on too long, this show starts and ends exactly where you'd want it, and when it ends it seems like they've lost track of where they were going with the story, Eureka Seven begs to differ! The pilot gives us an insight into the character development of the protagonist, the story as a whole unfolds well through the 50 chapters, including great mature humor that isn't there with regular anime shows, the action sequences are very new and unique, keeping viewers thoroughly entertained, and one of the best things about the writer is how he incorporates music to blend in with each scene be it action, humor or emotion.For the most part the show tells us about life in the circumstances aboard the crew of the show, eventually a bigger picture is revealed, where the story picks up pace and helps you dive right in to the fascinating world created. The animation is amazing where it really matters is the fight sequences- there are no still screens! From start to finish the show captivates you and entertains till the very end. Music, action, humor, animation at it's best and 50 episodes of it, what more could an avid fan or a person new to anime require?",
        "Don't know how I found this show, but at one point I decided to watch a free streaming episode online. Since then, it started an Eureka Seven addiction that will probably continue unabated until I have all 50 episodes and I have worn my DVD and/or hard drive out. Character development is oblique and quite mysterious with a diverse character set with counterparts. Episode 26 is my favorite with the culmination of the reversal of the main character actions of Eureka and Renton, but honestly I think there is only one episode that I wouldn't watch many, many, many times again. My family and friends think I'm crazy. Yes I am. Crazy about Eureka Seven.",
        "My first thoughts were 'South Park turned Robo Anime'.Cool,is it?I seriously thought this was South Park turned anime.To me,it seems Renton is Stan Marsh,Eureka is Wendy Testaburger,and Talho is Shelley Marsh.I only read book 1,but it's good so far.Sometimes,the sentences were weird because they cut it short to make fans wonder what the character speaking was about to say,but it's so obvious what they were going to say next.Some sexual innuendo,but it's OK overall.I would totally recommend it for Robo anime fans.Robo anime doesn't usually interest me,but this pulled me in right after reading a 13 page preview in Anime Insider magazine."

    "One Piece": [
        "A wonderful well grounded comforting long winded glorious series of magnificent magnitude! Full of adventure, comedy, legendary action, compelling characters, great vibes and better than I could've imagined.One of my other favorites anime's is JoJo's bizarre adventure and now One Piece is on par with that for me; I occasionally watch the genre I probably should more. Monkey D. Luffy is one of the best characters I've seen in awhile. I originally had seen around 36 episodes I think 6 years ago on Hulu it didn't have much of the Dub glad I have more access to a lot more thanks to Netflix I have something I can crave for most likely months/years. I love One Piece a lot so worth it, I bet gets even better from where I was.In the last month I've watched a couple hundred episodes I can easily say it's one of the best shows out there. It's goofy, has treasure, adventure, action, epic emotions, amazing characters and masterful storytelling; nice innocent gloriousness! I have over 2 thousand reviews and this is one that I've put more depth and more appreciation for over the years. One Piece is a pure gem!",
        "One Piece has become something of a colossal cult-phenomenon around the world, though it's a household name in Japan thanks to Toei Animation's seemingly undying commitment to Shonen Jump adaptations, such as Dragon Ball, Dr. Slump, Saint Seiya and Slam Dunk.At over 900 episodes this show has become probably the longest running digitally-painted anime in history: thanks to Toei's transition to digital cel-animation in the late 1990s. This show's got great characters, a fun world and the action gets just enough punch to not be too boring or derivative of Toei's other Shonen-derived shows.This is an anime household name and anyone into Japanese animation should give this one a shot. P.S. You DON'T need to have seen all of this show's episodes because... y'know: it's ridiculous catch-up time in one sitting.",

Luffy will sure to succeed his goal in becoming the Greatest Pirate that ever lived.Comic made back in the late 90s, and the anime series has been around since the earlier days of SpongeBob. I first heard of it when it came on the FoxBox back in late 2004. I wasn't entirely into many anime back then. And I never saw the English Dub of the series, as I found it to be an OK series. After reading on the internet that the dub is heavily edited and nothing like the original. I grew interest on how good it is. I read the first volume of the Manga series. And liked how the story was going.Wasn't until January 2007, when I finally start to check out the Anime. Only I viewed the episodes that are subtitled, uncut, and uncensored. And I grew to love it. The animation is very well done, it's funny, it's action packed, and it's dramatic sometimes. I don't even consider it a kid's cartoon, when it's more aimed to teenagers. But with an interesting cast of characters, and over a hundred secondary/miscellaneous characters. One Piece is indeed a great Anime next to Case Closed, Naurto, & other ongoing series.The reason why it's very underrated was because of 4Kids being the first company to distribute the anime. Which they edited and censored a lot. And many flaws in the dubbing. Such as voices that don't suit the characters' personalities. Too many pirate accents and catch-phrases that get old instantly. All the violence, blood, alchol, drugs, and nudity were altered and removed. All the weapons were altered to look harmless. 4Kids spent more time edditting than spending time on the scripts. Plus a lot of filler and small episodes were removed. And most of them were too important to take out in the series. The good thing is 4kids no longer owns rights to One Piece. I knew they would drop it, because they did a poor job in introducing the series to English speaking countries.With over 300 episodes, I can tell that One Piece is really big in Japan. I've seen all the current episodes. And can't get enough of it.So those who like their Anime uncut, should highly recommend seeing One Piece uncut by fan subs or Funimation's release on the series.",
        "Not the best anime I watched But It has a special place in my heart, I watch One Piece since 2010 and I never got bored all the time I watched, but the level of the anime decreased after the Tow year, Except Dressrosa arc the rest arc after tow years have fallen seriously,",
        "There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show. \"I don't like the art style,\" or \"I've seen the dub - NO THANKS.\" I'm guilty of both of these myself. But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece. For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is. If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh. They butchered it, there's really no other way to put it. They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series. FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go.As for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen. Much more \"cartoonish\" and maybe not what you'd expect from an anime. Despite that, you end up loving it. I wouldn't even say that you have to \"get used to it\" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way. It didn't even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before. Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have. Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at.Now that we've got those two points out of the way...One Piece is actually one of the best shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. The plot is pretty basic at first. Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure 'one piece' and become Pirate King, and he's looking for a crew to sail with him. You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them. They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities. They form one very quirky crew that's always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams. Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew. Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason. Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the series. No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses.The plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE. Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you'll ever watch. The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC. But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge. The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few. There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor.One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA.In a word, One Piece is perfect. And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say? It's been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end. It is, simply put, amazing.",
        "Let me start by saying, I don't understand Japanese and I'm a huge fan of Naruto, Shippuuden and Bleach (of course, all original Japanese versions). One Piece was shown on Cartoon Network when I was 13/14 & I thought it was lame. Now, I see why it was lame, it was 4kids English version which was pretty horrible.Monkey. D. Luffy is the captain of a small group of pirates, famous as the Straw Hat Pirates. He recruits a small and diverse group of people who will be his nakama on the journey. He is more interested in food and nakamas than in gold & money as normal pirate would be. He is a comedian more than a captain, but he rises to the occasion when needed and he's a good role model. He wants to get to One Piece & become the King Of Pirates. He gets Roronoa Zoro on board first. He is a highly skilled swordsman & is known as the pirate hunter Zoro. He uses three katanas & its his ambition to become the best swordsman in the world. Then Nami comes aboard as the skilled navigator. Its her dream to draw the map of the whole world. After that, Usopp the storyteller (i.e he's a great liar) becomes their nakama.Next Sanji becomes their cook. His dream is to prove that All-Blue exists and he's an awesome kicker along with being a highly skilled cook. But, he loses it whenever he sees a beautiful lady. Then comes Chopper, a reindeer (you heard me right!). He becomes their doctor and he's very good at it. Then Nico Robin hops on aboard. Her dream is to find out about the ultimate Poneglyph, Rio Poneglyph. She has a power and a troubled past.This story is about taking the initiative to go for your dreams. Take the awesome adventures with Luffy and his nakama and you'll fall in love with them. There is comedy, spirit, love and an awe-inspiring factor in the anime. Even the animation which feels weird at first grows on you so much that you'll like this kind of animation more than the others.Now, I have just finished seeing the Sky Island episodes where Enel is fighting Luffy (200th episode). I have to say I am hooked to this show. This is definitely a show not for meant for kids. Even if you hate hearing the Japanese language, try seeing it for some episodes and you'll get hooked. I can't recommend this series enough. See it, believe it, enjoy it. This is my all time favourite anime, above Bleach & Naruto. This is miles above those anime. Anyone who has seen all three anime will agree with me!10/10",
        "One Piece was one of my favorite anime of all time until around episode 500. The various arcs with their stories and characters were highly enjoyable. The end of the Enies Lobby arc was the first time an anime actually made me cry and to this day whenever I go back to the scene that did that I still tear up. One Piece was just that good back then.Unfortunately the quality of the anime has dropped considerably from episode 500 onward. In the past when the anime was catching up usually Toei Animation produced a few filler episodes after they had finished a main arc. Even though some of these fillers were weaker than the main story episodes it allowed them to continue with a good pacing while producing episodes on a mostly weekly base.However the amount of content that was covered with each episode got more and more stretched out the further we got past episode 500. I can easily provide numbers for this as well.\nThe Enies Lobby arc had 56 chapters in the manga and was covered in 46 episodes. This means you had a bit more than 1 chapter per episode.\nThe Fish-Man Island arc was the first one to have more anime episodes (58) than manga chapters (56).\nThe Dress Rosa Saga (Punk Hazard and Dressrosa) had 172 episodes covering 148 manga chapters.\nThe Whole Cake Island arc had 95 episodes covering 78 chapters. This means we almost had 20 episodes within this arc with purely stretched out content and filler which dragged down the story as a whole because the build up to the fights and fights themselves got constantly stretched out. Toei also used basically any trick they could to accomplish that. The most lazy and obvious attempts at this I've seen was for example an episode where we saw a scene three times in the same episode. First the actual scene happened and then there were two flashbacks showing the exact same thing again within the same episode. This just destroys any good element you may have within the story.To make One Piece as good as it was the episode schedule would need to be changed so that they show sagas for about 6 months of the year while taking a break the other half of the year. Toei won't do that though as One Piece has been an important source of revenue for them for a pretty long time. And because of that the anime version of One Piece is basically ruined.I'd easily recommend One Piece until around Fish-Man island (8-9/10 rating). Everything afterwards gets a 2 or 3 out of 10. I finally dropped the anime at episode 904 even though I hadn't really gotten enjoyment out of it for quite a while.",
        "The East Blue saga is a great beginning for the show, it introduces the characters and the world very well while having solid action. I really like that there's an entire arc for every recruits as it gives us time to get to know them. The worldbulding is amazing as we understand perfectly the rules and cultures of the world, the art style helps to set the world apart from other animes as it's very unique. The Romance Dawn arc is a start that makes you want to see more and instantly like Luffy while also making Zoro a legend. The Orange Town arc makes Nami an nuanced character that's very intriguing and make Buggy the Clown a good villain to drive the plot and bring some humor. The Syrup Village arc is very well made in the way it shows the people of this world and how innocents can be affected by the pirates, the villain could've been better. The Baratie arc was my least favorite of the saga as it's drawn out for too long, Zoro's fight, Sanji's back story and the crew were interesting but it could've been way shorter. The Arlong Park arc is the first arc that live up to One Piece's reputation. The arc has the first amazing villain with Arlong that's really despicable and intimidating. The arc gives awesome relationships, iconic scenes and a great backstory to Nami that makes the arc have a lot of emotional weight. The Loguetown arc was different from the five others as it's the characters running around the city which is pretty fun although it stays away from the other arcs.The Arbasta saga is a small step down from East Blue for me, without the wonder of crafting the Straw Hats crew it just doesn't feel as important, at least for the first half, my two favorite arcs were Drum Island because of Chopper and Arbasta because of the scale. The Reverse Moutain arc felt like an obstacle in the plot, it was solid but I don't see why it was made. The Whiskey Peak arc continues to flesh out the crew while having them in a environment that leads to a good plot. The Little Garden arc was really good, the only thing it didn't have is great villains, it had amazing worldbuiding and excellent character moments, especially between Zoro and Sanji. The Drum Island arc introduces one of my favorite character so far in Chopper, his gentle personality and sad backstory make him an amazing character, the arc has also a story that's interesting throughout and has a great political analysis. The characters of the arc are memorable, there were a lot of them that were integral to the plot. The Arbasta arc is thirty-nine episodes which can be scary considering One Piece's pace but I think it's well paced as there's something interesting in most episodes and there's a lot of fights. The arc offers the most threatening villain of the series up to this point in Crocodile and his supporting villains also give good moments. The passion that Vivi has for her home and the political situation is really interesting as it's literally and figuratively a time bomb. Nico Robbin is also a captivating presence.The Sky Island Saga only has two cannon arcs, it's a fun story that introduces one place that has great worldbuiding and then has amazing action. The Jaya arc is alright, it's pretty much an exposition arc with a simple but effective story, it has good worldbuiding but not a lot more. The Skypiea arc is great in retrospective but while watching it the pacing is a problem, at least in the first half. The first half let you discovers the world of Skypiea which is great but not great enough for more that many episodes. The second half is amazing and saves the arc in my opinion, it's action filled and it benefits from the previous episodes. It's grandiose action that lets you know where every member of the crew is at all times which is really fun to follow. The arc also has the first villain I did not understand how the Straw Hats would defeat in Enel, he might not be as cool as Arlong and Crocodile but he's so powerful that he gives really intense moments and leads the series to very high highs.The Water 7 saga made me change my opinion on the show, I now understand why people have it as one of the greatest as this saga is either funny of really intense for such a long period of episode. Everywhere online people say the Long Ring Long Land arc is one of the weakest, although I don't strongly disagree, I think it's fine, it takes time to breath after Skypiea and it strengthens the relations of the Straw Hats as they haven't been together a lot previously. On a side note, the arc also introduces Aokiji who seems to be the most threatening villain yet and leaves a strong impression after a short time in the arc. The Water 7 arc is not far from perfect, it's a fun ride for all of its run time as it's very well paced and very eventful. The characters of the arc are all interesting, from the Franky family that are a blast to be around to the villain that are really impressive. It's thematically the most complex arc yet with the relation of the Straw Hats being explored through the eyes of Nico Robin and Usopp who are given amazing stories, we learned more about the most mysterious character in Robin and the show finally made me care for Usopp when it comes to the narrative. The Enies Lobby arc is the best yet, the stakes are enormous with all the lives that are in play and the Buster Call threatening every second. There's a tone of action and the entire run time is captivating, there's always something happening. Like the previous arc, every character is interesting and the villain are extremely powerful therefore very menacing. There's a lot of character development in the arc with Luffy realizing that he has to improves, Robin getting a backstory that's one of the best I've seen and every characters going through a lot. The Post Enies Lobby arc is a necessary breather after the intense arcs before, it concludes some of the plotlines that were yet to be solved while having a lot of funny moments and some update with characters such as Ace and Shanks.The Thriller Bark saga is the funniest one yet, it embraces the silliness of the show and brings a really fun time. The villains are cartoonishly evil as they're really funny and have no redeemable qualities, their motivations are despicable and the actions they take are even worst. It introduces Brook who's a joy to be around, his energy and interesting story offers a lot to like. With the saga being the shortest one and having only one arc, the thing that holds it back is that it doesn't accomplishes a lot in the first half of the saga. The second half is really good as there's a tone of action, it introduces Kuma therefore really intense story beats and it has a beautiful ending to the arc.The Summit War saga is the most intense of them all, there's a lot happening and every arc as a lot got on. The Sabody Archipelago arc is very unique, it starts off with very low stakes with the story of Duvall that's really funny but it quickly becomes really intense. It's thematically the strongest as it tackles the themes of slavery and corruption. It also as a lot of lore explanation that's incredibly interesting through the word of Rayleigh who is one of the many great characters introduced in the arc. It has a tone of action that leads to an incredible ending. The Amazon Lily arc was fun and a lot less intense than the previous arc which is necessary to calm the story after what happened. Seeing Luffy run around and crack jokes while learning about Boa Hancock and her people was great. The Impel Down arc has the most action of so far, every episode has action and the stakes are really high so it's really captivating. The new characters are amazing and seeing the old enemies of Luffy at his side is something you couldn't predict. It's one thing to have a lot of action but the Marineford arc is on a whole other level, it has the action and it also has incredible plot with a tone of twist. The arc has a tone of characters you want to see fight as it's the culmination of everything that came before it, that makes every episode a masterpiece of anime. The Post-War arc is very impactful, it's awesome to see the crew again, it's really sad to see Luffy grieve and to explore his relation his brothers.East Blue Saga: 8.5/10\nArbasta Saga: 8/10\nSky Island Saga: 8/10\nWater 7 Saga: 10/10\nThriller Bark Saga: 8.5/10\nSummit War Saga: 10/10.",

        "One of the best anime ever and a must watch even for non anime fans. The story, characters. World building, action, comedy, drama, writing, acting in japanase, settings, tone, visuals especially now with the wano arc., it's crazy art style and character designs but in a good way. There's so much going on here then meets the eye and while it may have animation/pacing issues they never ruin the entire time you watch it. This and the pokemon anime will always be awesome to me as my favorite animes ever. Watch this before you die!",
        "Since the Fishman Island, especially after the 2-year timeskip, the show has been unnecessarily extended and elaborated in too many details and many scenes contain unnecessary delays and \"non-sense\" arguments. Right after the timeskip, the Straw Hat crew seemed to develop physically and mentally, but sadly they were like that for only a number of episodes and they went back to be babies with developed bodies.\nThe behaviors of the characters in Dressrosa were my last straws. And the 3 stars that I give here is for the great stories in the beginning of the show.",
        "I'm writing this possibly midway through the Wano Country Arc, the manga is still in Act 3 (of a potential? 5) and who knows how much is ~really~ left of One Piece. We could be looking at as few as 3 years or as many as 10. One thing is for certain, even though the ride isn't over, the ride so far has been absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best journeys fiction has ever offered. Eiichiro Oda is a literary genius.For being a manga and an anime that have taken no more than a few weeks breaks at a time, the quality to the quantity is beyond immaculate. From (basically) start to finish there has not been a dip in the quality of story-telling. One could say some of the best arcs took place earlier in the series, but that certainly doesn't discount just how fantastic some of the more recent arcs are. Even the (often contentious) Fishman Island Arc is leagues above some of the outstanding arcs of other popular manga/anime.Without diving too deep or giving too much away, one of the standalone factors that makes One Piece so beyond stellar is how impressively funny and brutally painful it can be, all within a couple pages or minutes. The fact that it is one of the funniest series in no way undermines the great depths of drama One Piece reaches. Are there funnier manga/anime? Are there sadder and more harrowing manga/anime? Yes and yes, but the fact that One Piece is such a master class in both comedy and drama only exacerbates just how freakishly human One Piece truly is. It captures beautifully the highs and lows of the human condition in such a way that seems impossible for a series with Devil Fruit abilities, haki, fishmen, sky people, giants, and singing skeletons.Beyond that, the thing that truly sets One Piece apart (and a term all too ubiquitous with the series) is its world building. The world of One Piece is MASSIVE, and that's not just describing the actual planet where the story takes place, but the lore, the characters, the relationships between characters so seemingly disparate the thread could only have been finessed by someone with a mind like Oda, a mind, mind you, that is no stranger to making obscure callbacks to details so minuscule hundred and hundreds of chapters ago that even the most devout fans can miss. One Piece is by and large one of the single most expansive fictional lores helmed by a single author (and illustrator!) For a little bit of context, the Lord of the Rings including The Hobbit is roughly 1,550 pages while One Piece is somewhere around 20,000 pages of illustration, and while a manga panel may not say exactly one thousand words, it's beyond commendable that one person could pen 20,000 pages of anything for one singular story. A singular story that encompasses so many characters, and insights, and backgrounds, and history, and minute details, that millions of people from virtually every country have come to see this tale and journey as something of a second world, a place they can escape to and join this magnificent captain and his ragtag crew as they journey to the end of the world.One Piece is truly something beyond magical, and when it eventually ends it will exist in the echelon of the greatest stories ever told. It could end right now and still make it into that category, but as any fan can tell you, the best is still yet to come. So, until then, this tentative review will have to do.",
        "This show has a great concept and a likeable cast of characters. But its unbearable to watch. Who knows why it has as many eps as it does. The arcs are just the same thing over and over. Its like the characters are stuck in a timeloop doomed to repeat the same plot for a thousand episodes.If you want a good nights sleep, watch this one.",
        "A pirate named Luffy wants to become the pirate king, but besides that, he is on a quest to go to the Grand Line and organise his own pirate to search for the treasure that that has sent people sailing to the seas, called 'One Piece'.ONE PIECE is an absolutely fantastic and fun anime. Also every episode in the series cannot be missed, since each episode has something to do with the storyline which make the show more and more addictive, unlike some other TV shows. There are even times where it can actually even make you care for the characters, which also make the show surprisingly moving.IMPORTANT: Beware of the English dub because it's been Americanised and politically-corrected to make it a kids show. It's been distributed by 4Kids. So in other words, ONLY watch the Japanese version otherwise the American version will turn you off.",
        "There is nothing someone can really tell you about One Piece that will do it justice.Iichiro Oda, the guy who writes One Piece, DOES AN EPISODE EVERY WEEK, EVERY SEASON, EVERY YEAR. Nobody has jack on him, he's the greatest, and he never stops pumping out the awesomeness.Do yourself a favor, get it in japanese w/ subtitles, and prepare yourself for the most epic story you've ever seen.You may be unsure at first, the animation is okish, but keep going, there is only Awesomeness ahead.",
        "I just finished watching One Piece till episode 818 as more English episodes had yet to be released. It took me 1 year 28 days since starting on June 18, 2021.The show got tedious at times in the beginning, but the grand story comes 100s of episodes later, it blows the mind as well as the impressive world building! It is extremely worth watching!! The creativity is off the charts. Characters like Zoro are very cool!! It even may have surpassed Naruto to some extent recently... Coming from someone who is a diehard fan of Sasuke Uchiha. The animation and artstyle by Toei Animation has been very consistent and the action is amazing.For me it was a very funny, extremely emotional journey with some cool and hearttouching moments!!

        "The Anime \"One Piece\" takes place in a world where pirates rule the seas, Devil Fruits are scattered all over the world, and the most prized possession of Gol D. Roger is the target... One Piece!Gol D. Roger was the Pirate King who had fame, fortune, power, everything that anyone wanted to have... On the day of his execution, he revealed the location of his treasure, One Piece. He said that it is hidden somewhere in \"The Grand Line\".This made people set sail and try to obtain the treasure of treasures, One Piece. Sadly, many have failed and died trying to obtain it. But over the years, it has drawn attention to hundreds of Pirate groups who seek the title of Pirate King. The whole world has entered the Golden Era of Pirates. The Era where almost every pirate's dream is to become The Pirate King. They formed formidable crews to overcome those who are also seeking the treasure of treasures.This is where the story starts. The protagonist of the tale is a boy who had set his eyes on becoming the new Pirate King. The Boy's name is Monkey D. Luffy. He's the son of the most wanted man named Monkey D. Dragon and the grandson of Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp.Heads up, Portgas D. Ace is not Luffy's Brother. Ace is the son of the Pirate King and his real name was Gol D. Ace. He took his mom's surname Portgas, instead of Gol.On the island of East Blue, Luffy grew up in hoping to be a pirate someday. He befriends with a pirate named Captain Shanks. He looks up to Shanks as a hero and would do anything to be part of his crew. But he was too young at that time to become a part of the crew.One day Luffy accidentally ate the Devil's Fruit, Gomu Gomu (Rubber) that Shanks has at his possession. It gave Luffy the ability to become a human rubber. But once a person eats the Devil's Fruit, they'll be cursed with the powers forever and you'll lose the ability to move when they fall into the sea. Now Luffy is cursed to be a human rubber forever but vowed that even if he is cursed, he'd use this to his advantage to get the title of \"Pirate King\".As Shanks departs with his crew, he gave Luffy his most prized possession, his straw hat. He told him to keep it with him, until they meet again.A few years later, Luffy starts his quest to find some friends for his pirate crew. Throughout the series, he'll find new lands, new allies, treasures, dangers, and plenty of villains to face. On his journey to find new nakamas(friends), he met Roronoa Zoro the swordsman, Nami the navigator and thief, Usopp the Liar, Sanji the cook, Chopper the team's doctor, Franky the shipwright and Brook the musician.Their adventures can be unbelievably funny and other times, they're incredibly sad. There are only two animes that I cried on. This one and the other is Naruto. I can't hold my tears because this anime got into me.. Most of the background story of the characters are really really sad.This anime left me speechless the first time i saw it and it still leaves me speechless now.. And I still can't get enough of it. It even inspired me to create my own manga... The title is \"My Twelve Wings\" Hopefully, in the near future, it'll get published... hehe hopefully... I just started this morning but I already have an ending...Eiichiro Oda! You're my #1 favorite manga artist and thanks to you, the world of One Piece is made...Someday, I'll tell my future children and grandchildren the story of the almighty Monkey D. Luffy and his crew!I'll cherish this anime till the day I die",
        "(Review for both the anime and the manga, December 5, 2021, currently with 1034 chapters and 1001 episodes).Wealth, Fame, Power...Those were the words that started the greatest story of all time. Words that still hold massive amount of meaning in the story today. Words that will hold even more meaning when the story is ultimately brought to an end.We see how wealth, fame and power can impact the people of this world. That these things cannot bring happiness, and in many cases will just bring the complete opposite. Look at the Celestial Dragons. The most wealthy, powerful and quite famous individuals in the world. They view themselves as better than everyone else, that they can do whatever they want, even if it's incredibly inhumane. But in the eyes of the people that live beneath them, they are monsters. Monsters who are slaves to the wealth, fame and power they posses, and monsters who enslave. People who are not free, and take away freedom.Freedom.This is one of the core, if not the main element present throughout the entire series. Because, those three words ushered at the beginning of this story do not hold meaning in a persons life if that person is not free, and is willing to help others be free. They hold no power without freedom, because ultimately, the people like the Celestial Dragons, are not powerful people. They cannot sway the masses through the use of words and gain the trust of a random person on the street. They are feared. And does being feared make one powerful? Maybe. But people do not like to recognize it.The protagonist in this story, Monkey D. Luffy, wants to become the Pirate King, the freest man in the world. He wants to share that freedom, and is willing to with absolutely anyone. Even someone who may have attempted to kill him mere minutes ago. He is the pure embodiment of freedom, not giving a care in the world and just having fun.Another core element of the series is friendship. The crew of pirates you grow to love, are the best of friends. They will do whatever they need to do in order to keep each other safe, to keep the freedom they work so hard to gain. But challenge to take away that freedom, and you'll be sure you're not gonna get away easy.There is so much more I could say about One Piece. About the great characters, unmatched worldbuilding, and one of the greatest mysteries in any form of media ever. But that could go on forever. One Piece is not perfect, no story is. It has it's flaws. Sometimes humor doesn't land, maybe a fight scene isn't great, a character is just annoying, or even entire arcs that just drag and are sometime almost boring to sit through. But, there is just something special about One Piece that no series has ever been able to re-create, and I think will ever be able to create. It is truly something you should watch or read in your lifetime, and some of the values and beliefs can make you leave a better person. It did that for me. 10/10.Below are my ratings for each arc of the series below, if you are at all interested.Romance Dawn - 8/10\nOrange Town - 6/10\nSyrup Village - 6.5/10\nBaratie - 8/10\nArlong Park - 9/10\nLoguetown - 7/10\nReverse Mountain - 6/10\nWhisky Peak - 7.5/10\nLittle Garden - 6.5/10\nDrum Island - 8.5/10\nAlabasta - 9/10\nJaya - 8/10\nSkypeia - 7.5/10\nLong Ring Long Land - 6/10\nWater 7 - 9.5/10\nEnies Lobby - 10/10\nPost Enies Lobby - 8.5/10\nThriller Bark - 5.5/10\nSabaody Archipelago - 9/10\nAmazon Lily - 6.5/10\nImpel Down - 7.5/10\nMarineford - 10/10\nPost War - 7.5/10\nReturn to Sabaody - 7/10\nFish Man Island - 5/10\nPunk Hazard - 6.5/10\nDressrosa - 8.5/10\nZou - 8.5/10\nWhole Cake Island - 9/10\nLevely - 7.5/10\nWano - 9.5/10 m.",

My least favorite but it has some good fight scenes especially Zoro and Sanji.Water 7\nWe see Franky and learn strange things about Robin. We see The Great CP-9 and they take Robin. We learn sad things about Merry and Usopp leave the crew.Enies Lobby\nThis arc. Just Masterpiece. It was perfect the fight scenes, the story line, the characters.

Luffy learn something bad about Ace and he want to go Impel Down because of it.Impel Down\nWe saw Bon Clay, Mr. 3, Buggy, Jinbei, Crocodile, Ivankov. This arc was so good. Luffy want to take back Ace but he can't do it.Marineford\nI don't know what I am going to say about this arc. It's the best arc for now. War is amazing. All of the characters are perfect. The Luffy's Haki is perfect. Just perfect but Ace died in the Great War. That's one of the saddest moments in One Piece.Post-War\nWe saw Luffy's back-story and we see Sabo's dying.

I can't handle it anymore. There is too much awesomeness. The Fights, Sanji's back-story, Luffy's fate in Sanji, Katakuri vs Luffy. That's a perfect arc. Most importantly The MVP of this arc is Brook. He did so much important thing in this arc. End of the arc Luffy and Sanji got new bounties and Luffy become The Fifth Emperor.Levely\nWe saw a lot of important thing in this arc. Imu Sama, The Big Straw Hat and something happened to Sabo but we don't know it right now and we learn that The Warlord System is removed.Wano Country\nWano. A masterpiece. The animation is perfect. The fights, Oden back-story, The reunion The Straw Hats, Wano's beauty, All of it perfect. This arc is my second favorite arc. It's still ongoing but the end of it I'm sure that is is going to be a number one.That's it. If you're not watching One Piece, you're missing a lot. It's a Masterpiece. Don't scared the numbers of episodes. You will not regret and most of the people say it will be better after 300th episode or 400th episode but they wrong it is perfect from the start. You must watch it right now.Thanks for reading.",
        "For years i avoided this anime because of the 4kids version, but i was always interested in seeing what it was like to watch in japs with subtitles because it was currently considered one of the best animes out there, and from episode 1 to episode 330 i was captivated.I rediscovered this masterpiece and the extent of 4kids damage washed away in time.from that moment on i couldn't stop watching, this show is incredible and incredibly moving, i've lost count of the times i've broken into tears watching them leave old friends, reunite current ones, burn their ship.And i always figured this show would be funny and i was severely disappointed to find that it's not, not funny in the slightest, it's throatrippingly hilarious, especially the scene where Ussop and Carue run for their lives from Miss Wednesday and Mr 4 (i think?) that today is still my favorite scene. episode 126 i think it was.If you want to become a fan then please avoid the 4kids version at all costs, if you still want to see an English one, watch the funimation version",
        "One Piece is the best selling manga of all time for a reason! Oda is a genius created over a thousand characters and many of them are so memorable with amazing world building and brilliant art. Kaizoku ou ore wa naru!",
        "It starts going downhill fast in Season 11 where half the episodes can be fast-forwarded through because they are 90% recaps of episodes from previous seasons.Season 12 is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay longer than it needs to be and gets boring af the longer it takes the Strawhats to rescue Nico Robine.I don't agree enough to research why Seasons 11 and 12 slid severely into mediocrity. Change in writers or production team? Don't really care at this point but yikes. If I weren't so invested in the series, I'd just bail. As it is, I keep it on in the background and pay attention when something interesting happens (which isn't often). Here's to hoping Season 13 recovers some of the shine."

        "Ever since I saw a trailer for this anime I wanted to see it so when I spotted the DVD boxed set for sale at a decent price I snapped it up; I'm glad I did as I enjoyed every moment even if I was reduced to tears by the end. The animation is excellent and the music by Kou Ootani is equally good. Like all series what matters most is the characters and how their story is told; here the story is relatively simple but a joy to watch and the characters are people you enjoy spending time with.The story follows the life of a girl who one day dreams of falling then awakens to find herself emerging from a cocoon. She has no memories and is given the name Rakka by the people who find her. These aren't ordinary people however, they are Haibane: angel-like with wings and halos. Soon Rakka is given a halo too and sprouts wings. Rakka lives with a group of Haibane but is particularly friendly with Reki who acts like a big sister to her. Over the course of the series she learns many things about Haibane life but not all of her questions are answered and by the end of the series the viewer will be left wondering about many things.If you are looking for a series full of laughs or action then this probably isn't the series for you but if you want something different that instead of answering every question leaves you thinking then give this a go. The characters were excellent and I was really interested in their world that is as mysterious to the viewer as it is to Rakka.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I found the first episode of this series mysterious and intriguing, and was excited to learn more about this strange world. But subsequent episodes were far more about these girls' day-to-day life than their mysterious circumstances. After a few episodes I looked up the recap on wikipedia and it sounds like the explanation is more straightforward and obvious than I was hoping. It's a pleasant series, but I just didn't see much point to watching more.",
        "I never expected this slow pacing anime about angel girls that good but boy, Charcoal Feathers Federation prove me that! Actually it is a very interesting name to call an anime that because as a non Japanese speaker, I would probably forget the title lol. I really liked the English Dub actresses on this and I'm even glad that the animators didn't make all the girls look fake in the usual ways but I'm so glad they took a step back from that. Rather than be focused less on the looks, instead they focused on the personality wise of the girl characters.Definitely give this anime a watch if you ran out of anime Ideas on what to watch, this way you'll discover a hidden underrated gem !",
        "The best-kept secret in the world of Japanese animation is Tomokazu Tokoro's Haibane Renmei, a thought provoking and very moving 13-part 2002 TV series that is part fantasy, part coming-of-age story, and part religious allegory. Haibane is a creation of Yoshitoshi ABe who designed the characters for Serial Experiments Lain and inspired the science fiction series NieA_7. The story is very simple, yet it is full of understated poetry and rich meaning that can be enjoyed by people of all ages (but may be too dark for children under the age of ten).The story is inspired by Haruki Murakami's novel Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World in which a man suddenly appears without memory of a previous life in a strange village surrounded by a high wall and ends up working in the library, replacing another who simply disappears. Set in a village called Glie, angel-like people with wings and halos called Haibane or \"charcoal feathers\" live alongside humans in the town, also surrounded by impenetrable walls. The laws are made by a council called the Haibane Renmie who decreed that the Haibane cannot own anything new, cannot go outside the wall and are forbidden to even touch it. Only the Toga, mysterious masked men who provide for and protect the Haibane, can leave the town.The Haibane live in an abandoned building called Old Home and have no memory of a previous life, only a vague recollection of a dream they had inside the cocoon in which they were hatched fully-grown. Others live in the Waste Factory and are said to be \"rowdy\". Every so often, without warning, one of the Haibane disappears beyond the wall to an uncertain destination. This is the \"day of flight\" that is the fate of all Haibane except those that are \"sin-bound\" and must remain in darkness. As the series begins, a girl dreams of falling and, when she emerges from her giant cocoon, is named \"Rakka\" for falling. The early episodes deal with Rakka's arrival and adjustment to life as a Haibane.Rakka's best friend is Reki who takes care of the younger children and is very protective of Rakka, caring for her when her wings emerge. Reki's name means \"stones\" because in her dream she was walking on a path of stones. Rakka goes with each of the Haibane to their jobs to see where she would best fit in. Other characters include Nemu who works at the library, Kuu, a boyish-looking girl who is the youngest of the group, Kana, also a tomboy, and Hikari who works at a bakery. Halfway through the series, Rakka must deal with an unexpected loss of a member of the group who has taken flight. Rakka's wings begin to turn black and both she and Reki are haunted by incomplete memories of their cocoon dreams and recollections of committing harm to others.As the plot slowly unravels, both Reki and Rakka must overcome their feelings of inadequacy before they can move on and the atmosphere often becomes heavy and foreboding. Timeless questions are raised and left for us to ponder, yet the story has the simplicity of a children's book with a sense of mystery and awe about our place in the universe. Is this an allegory of our own after-life or is it about our waking life where no one knows for certain where they have come from and where they are going? Although the story line about sin and salvation strike a more conventional note, to the credit of the authors, they have emphasized personal responsibility and the need for us to take charge of our own lives. Haibane Renmie has just the right combination of magic and realism, and the visuals are beautiful to experience. With a lovely musical score, characters you can identify with, and a story that builds to a moving conclusion, Haibane Renmie is the best animated film I have seen.",
        "SummeryA girl with no name falls from the sky and finds herself in a very mysterious land, where nobody remembers of their previous life. In this land, angel-like beings, ash wings, have formed a society and live in harmony with the people of the town, helping them out. Later on, the girl gets a name--Rakka--grows a pair of wings and receives her own halo. Rakka is now an ash wing, too. While the new place seems to be like heaven for Rakka, she soon finds out that everything is not as easy as it might look. Why did Rakka become an ash wing, and what is the mystery behind her new home?I finish watch this yesterday and I have to say it was a very fun anime to watch. The characters were good, the voice acting was excellent and the sound track was beautiful.I highly recommend this.",
        "This show is a great example of how to integrate symbolism and metaphors into a story. But the serie' do contains some flaws, the first is the slow placing up until episode six. The lack of jumpstart makes a strange disjointment. The second flaw is that while some characters are extremely fleshed out and developed, we learn next to nothing about most of the Haibane. There is little background on Nemu and Kuu, and nothing at all about Kana and Hikari. This is also very strange.",
        "After watching Haibane Renmei early this year, I thought it was a bit different than Yoshitoshi Abes other works, (like Lain, which is a bit of a puzzler).  This series (Haibane Renmei) has an air of sadness to it, but also moments of happiness and joy, and doesn't mess around to much with your head.I really enjoyed it and would watch it several more times, enjoying it as much as the first. The ending had me virtually in tears, it really was perfect. If you're gonna purchase any anime on DVD in the future, this one should be next on your list. No doubt about that. This one makes the top of my favourite list without problems.",
        "I watched the interesting and arresting anime, Haibane Renmei. This fascinating 13 part series concerns some sweet angelic characters called Haibane. The heroine is a young newly born {or hatched} Haibane named Rakka. They all live with some humans in a strange town called Glie cut off from the rest of the world by a sinister and impassable Wall. Significant characters include Kuu, an early mentor of Rakka ,and the strange, yet endearingly compassionate Reki who has a mysterious personal history.The anime starts in a very leisurely fashion allowing the characters and relationships to develop naturally. As the story progresses through the first six episodes, the emotional ambiance becomes less sweet and more solemn and moving. We become aware of a very skillful use of symbols and dream imagery and a gentle sensitivity not unalloyed with a certain melancholy.But by the eighth episode the atmosphere becomes dramatically darker, more emotional, moving and intense\u2014a quality which continues through out the rest of the anime. Yet these episodes clearly relate to, build upon, and develop from the gentler, sweeter early sections. We are always aware of a developing coherent story line and logical character growth. We find ourselves relating to these strange beings and sharing their fears, frustrations, and sorrows.On a personal level, I think one of the reasons I like Haibane Rinmei so much is that I am strongly drawn to allegory and fantasy and both feature strongly and contribute to the impact of this series. I was impressed with the use of dream and nightmare imagery\u2014which at times is quite frightening and disturbing, especially in the second section of the anime. These dream sequences are integral to the plot and the themes in this remarkable work. And these themes are profound, involving the exploration of guilt, redemption and spiritual solidarity.The characters are wonderfully engaging and sympathetic though it isn't easy going on an emotional level. But the ending is one of the most moving I have ever seen in an anime.I loved it but I suspect it isn't for all tastes.",
        "A group of angel like beings are born from cocoons with no memory of their previous lives in a strange walled city.\nThis series has a lot of great aspects. It has an interesting premise, really nice animation and some great music. But it has problems.\nNone of the driving questions are given answers and are left entirely to speculation. The most obvious theory is that the city is some sort of purgatory and the Haibane move on to heaven/reincarnation/death. But it still would have been interesting to see what the Haibane's pasts were or what's outside the wall. What worldbuilding we do get is interesting, but it's pretty minimal. It just feels like they wasted some great opportunities. But this wouldn't be an issue if it were not for my main problem with it.\nThis series has very little plot. Many episodes can be entirely skipped without confusing the viewer. I enjoyed the first two, which did a great job of setting up the story, but after this, it slows to a halt. The series mostly consists of the characters working at their jobs and engaging in dull conversation.\nIn the last few episodes, things start to get going again, with the subplot focusing on Rakka and Reki's struggle to break free from sin and there is some interesting philosophical commentary, but even then it's pretty slow paced.\nThe two MCs, Rakka and Reki are both well written, but the rest of the characters are pretty flat. None of them get any characterization save for maybe one personality trait.\nIn sum, good animation, some decent worldbuilding, not much plot or characterization and too many missed opportunities. Everyone else seems to love it, though.",
        "This series was one I stumbled upon fairly late in the day.... Not until well into 2003 before I decided to see any of it. I was stupid not to have followed it from Day One.With the 2003 run of anime being so banal (and with 2004 being several magnitudes worse) I was forced to look back on shows I'd missed, and found an anime I now rank as one of my favourites.... Actually, a show I rank as one of my all-time favourites, anime or not.It isn't some explosive action-fest, or some great triumph of animation work and cg. What it is is a series made simply, with sympathetic characters in a strange yet familiar setting. When they go through pain and angst, you actually _feel_ for them. They are not ciphers to plot. In fact, there is very little plot to Haibane Renmei, so everything relies on the character interaction. The world of Limbo is going to elicit a lot of emotions from those who have arrived there in order to be judged worthy of moving on to Heaven (or wherever it is the Haibane go upon their Day of Flight). Even the loss of those Haibane who have moved on is keenly felt (the collapse of Rakka's state of mind after the disappearance of Kuu) and the ending, even if some people feel it wasn't quite up to the rest of the series, leaves this reviewer quite haunted. Reki was my favourite character from the show, and her relationship, and eventual redemption, with Rakka was quite powerful for me.For some, this may seem a dozy exercise in drama. For some who are munching on ritalin, that is. Haibane Renmei is a labour of love for its creators, and I've done my damnest to spread it round to even those who don't watch anime.",
        "I wanted to LOVE this anime. I had huge hopes for it, having come across it in so many \"top anime\" lists written by people that weren't 14 year old boys (or those with the same mentality). I watched the first two episodes and was completely taken in by the atmosphere, the gorgeous animation that created the perfect ambiance; the process of Rakka's \"birth\" and transformation, the mystique surrounding the wall and the outside world. There was an exciting yet mellow sense of nostalgia with a touch of darkness and mystery. And that was pretty much it. There was hardly any plot, hardly any character development, and the moralizing was pretty run-of-the-mill \"be good and you will become enlightened\". I stopped caring pretty quickly. What a waste of such gorgeousness! I really thought this was going to be like a warm and fuzzy yet captivating anime blanket that I could hide in, when I tired of boy wizards and over-wrought sci-fi, or male-centered, fan servicing high school dramas. But this was majorly disappointing to me. Perhaps I brought my film-snob attitude with me to the world of anime, as the last great hope--that you can have action/adventure or sci-fi and fantasy that are beautiful, well made and actually thought provoking. Having plowed through almost every critically acclaimed film I could find from around the world, I found anime and thought, wow! Character development? Engaging stories? Social satire? Different cultural philosophies? Sign me up! And while I've found some that delivered, I've started to become a bit disappointed. I was waiting to watch Haibane Renmei for a while, as if holding out for the right time to savor this mysterious realm, all to myself. But it never quite delivers what I'm looking for. And I'm not saying I think there is something wrong in enjoying this anime; it just didn't hold my interest, didn't engage me, and I eventually stopped caring about the characters, as the air of foreboding mystery sort of dissipated altogether. Oh well, back to the internets to find something else.",

However, although there is a sad depressing side to the later half of the anime, it swings through the whole gamut of emotions. As another poster noted, this anime does require a calm attitude and patience to let it all sink in and notice many subtle clues about the characters. So if you've read this far, stop wasting time and go watch it.. in fact I think I'll go see it again (#3rd time).If you like this anime... go see \"Jacob's Ladder\".",
        "Sick of stereotypical anime? No need for big robots, big chests, lots of yelling and immature humor? Check out Haibane Renmei. In my opinion, it's in a class by itself.HR begins with a young girl 'hatching' from a cocoon, unable to remember her name, her life, or anything else. She is greeted by 5 other females (looking to be between 10 and 25) who have wings and a halo. She is given a name, based on her dream in the cocoon (Rakka, which means \"falling), as are the others. Soon she grows wings and is given a halo as well. The winged creatures are called \"Haibane.\"The first 5 or so episodes are intentionally slow going, as we are given a view of Rakka's adjustment to life as a Haibane. However, as slow going as they are, the episodes are very engaging. By episode 6, Rakka suffers a major loss, as she spends the rest of the series dealing with the loss and trying to answer the question: What are the Haibane?This series was created by the same person who created Serial Experiments: Lain. Rakka even looks a little like Lain. However, HR is a bit more straight-forward than Lain. It is an especally quiet series, the use of classical and baroque music add to the feel of the show. We're told a little about the Haibane, the rules they must follow, and the world they live in.The animation is intentionally not very flashy, however it is detailed and quite immaculate. We get the feeling that the Haibane live in a quaint little town which hasn't changed much over the years. The show is much the same in its feel of timelessness. It could take place now, 100 years ago, or even 100 years from now.In short, this is a show to show off to non-anime fans who have stereotyped all of it as either Pokemon or porn. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a trend...",
        "Note: this is from a video review, look for links on my profile page.Haibane Renmei is an incomplete, limited world, and so are its characters. This is not due to any deficient omission, but merely symbolic of the outside world. Stairs can represent an elevation of a mental state, halos solely an indicator of a norm and disruption thereof. The darkness is a device used as a horror trope, but unlike most such media this series recounts an internal sort of dread, a psychological possibility, an unknown within the universe, an existential uncertainty that could plague the mind.Light, the sole localized potency, easily extinguished like life, also has a limited cover. Wings are a vestige of an obscure past, like fragments from within a dream. Why must they only utilize forsaken objects? Is there a radiance that could overpower the innermost gloom? Could a door open the path out of a nightmare? What lay beyond a sleeping consciousness? What is art but interior warfare? How is a dream expressed through a scream? What is it that we forget, how do we reflect upon that midnight stream, why does reason retain it not?This mechanical world also has an upside, though, one where light takes the role darkness had inside a room, one where space is boundless (except for abstract limits of such symbolic darkness), one which is a norm, despite the margins of possibility, but is communicating with crows a standard? Is flight liberating, what lay beyond? Does it shelter us from ourselves? What do social bonds imply in the grand scheme of things? Does this melody keep track of erstwhile seconds?This story harbours darkness along with natural casualness, it glides to the future like time's inevitable arrow; how does life become one second and then the next? Could a fortress have a sunny disposition? Do we have any sway over the inexorable momentum? What psychological processes are rekindled while in a state of sleep?Myths are symbolic of an abstract need, a usually cathartic release of fantasy, a hyperbolic bridge between subjective understanding and the possible. In this series they may remain ununderstandable, but that is not the narrative's purpose, despite that it is too a testing ground of what may be likely and not so. How personal is an archetype, or could it merely be the result of an illusion? What makes an object representative of a series of inter-linked connections? Could anime, from Latin for 'soul', have the ultimate potential for such figurative art? Wings may be seen as explicitly religious, but here specifically they are but vestigial props, something that works only in the imagination as in the 'day of flight'. How different are conventional humans from the haibane? Why do they seem to pity them through charity? Perhaps because they are neither 'superior' beings, nor part of the majority within the town. How does, though, anyone come into existence? A plant that forms a cocoon is this story's premise, but how did they figure out any optimal methods before they had their traditions? A cycle of mythologized lives take this form, but most of the abstract notions, like 'coming to life' apply generally. The universe itself tumbled out of chaos, and seems destined to fizzle out in a similar manner. So, why does the mind attempt to confer symbols to randomness?Why does, rain for example, seem to indicate a negative atmosphere? When does a melancholic green turn into a demonic frolic? Is the world naturally dark, with the sun so easily blocked? What really separates life from death? How is a psyche able to handle a sudden halt in the subjective narrative? Are catecholamines involved? The anime's narrative could be regarded as specific to it, but it could also be abstracted to a sort of archetype. There are many unexplained things, like what is beyond the village, but the characters do not mostly attempt to tackle such issues unless in a desperate situation, kind of like how most of life operates, with potential, far-away problems given less priority than immediate ones. But what nestles in the darkness of one's mind? Is everyone truly an individual, and is the alternative a sociological illusion?This story, ultimately, is a mostly quiet attempt at emulating the essence of what existence could be about underneath. It is an alley that nature takes to form, coincidentally, a path sustaining that which is random, yet constitutes a thread illuminating everlasting, omnipresent darkness. It is about that case in a million that, while infinitesimal, is still imaginatively logical. It is a question, not an answer; realistic, but immersed in fantasy. It is about the cycle of life and death, and a combination too. It projects fleeting feelings onto a purported, snowy reality, creates storms of electrical sight, paints a landscape, and sends them away with a thought.",
        "Haibane Renmei is one of the most beautiful, original and meaningful animes. A young girl is born from a cocoon in an old building inhabited by Haibane, angel-like beings, without knowing anything about the world she has just entered and about her past. Very soon she learns that she is a Haibane herself, makes new friends and starts to explore the surroundings. She also gets a name: Rakka. In the first episodes we follow her as she gets to know the other Haibane and some nice people in a nearby town.It all looks quite peaceful, relaxing and a bit childish but as Rakka learns more about herself we begin to understand there are quite a few similarities between our life and that of the Haibane and a significantly darker and deeper tone kicks in. The whole series begins to reveal itself as a metaphor without losing in the process a driving force that has nothing to do with sterile intellectual analogies. The creator, Abe Yoshitoshi, has a message to tell but he does it with such artistic talent, emotional intensity and subtlety that you can fall in love with the series even if you notice its flaws. Haibane Renmei is for the child in every one of us who is still charmed by a wonderful Christmas tree even if he has reasons to believe there is no Santa.",
        "Haibane Renmei I usually don't like TV-series. I also don't really like anime, except for the films of Miyazaki. But Haibane Renmei is hard to classify as a standard anime. There's no flying limbs, nor any immature humor and attempts at getting you to look up girls skirts. Men who look like women and have stupid hair are also wonderfully absent. I might seem a bit biased here, but this is my impression of anime, and I've seen quite a bit randomly or through friends. On the surface Haibane Renmei seems like a fairly simple drama. This is because it's the impression the series tries to give us. On the first couple of episodes, there is an underlying uncertainty and darkness. As the series progresses in its 13 episode span, it becomes deeper and more thought provoking. It never spells out things clearly to the audience, and never answers all our questions. It remains wonderfully subtle, and after I finished watching it I thought about the series and its themes for several days.The series is set in a small town surrounded by high walls. In the city, together with human people live angelic like creatures called the Haibane, who are not allowed to leave the city. As the series starts, we see the birth of a new Haibane, Rakka, who is named after the dream she had while being born. Like all Haibane, she cannot remember her past or where she comes from. The series spends most its time exploring her living with her new Haibane friends. We are also introduced to them as the series starts. One problem with series is that they have very shallow characters, but not Haibane Renmei. The characters here feel painfully real and sincere. The series also explores several of the supporting characters, giving them all an amount of depth. This is also connected to the wonderful character design, and immediately as we see the visually we can assume what kind of characters they are. But the designs are not overdone, and they all reveal in time a certain amount of layers and depth.The animation isn't as high quality as some other popular anime, however, the backgrounds look beautiful and show great detail and artistry. The music also needs mention, using wonderful strings and soft acoustic guitars, as well as some beautiful piano work. Haibane Renmei spends a surprising amount of time layering and building its themes and symbolism. It takes situations that are common to us, but puts it into a slightly supernatural setting. And although all the main characters have wings and halos, they always seem extremely grounded and realistic. The series go through several moods and emotions, but always make it heartfelt. When the characters are happy, we feel happy, and when they are sad, we feel sad. But it avoids becoming melodramatic nor over the top. Some of the series saddest parts will truly sting your heart, unless you're made of stone.For a series that takes such a serious tone, Haibane Renmei gracefully avoids such series greatest clich\u00e9s. The symbolism is subtle and layered, but never seems overdone. There are truly intense moments, but the series also takes several moments to sit back and let the audience reflect, showing wonderful imagery of the landscape with beautiful music in the background. The themes are universal, but I'll not list them, in fear of spoiling the series for people who hasn't seen it. Make sure not to read too much about the story and what happens, and rather let the series unfold without knowing what might happen.Haibane Renmei is probably one of the finest audio-visual experiences I've had. Not many have seen it, which is sad, as it's so universal and could be enjoyed by so many people. I would recommend it to anyone, it could even work for ten year old kids and older. Although it's layered, it's never overtly complicated. Although it never answers many of our questions, it still isn't surreal and hard to penetrate. If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you go out and get it as soon as possible.",
        "Let me start by explaining that I am not a religion hater, but I have had several bad childhood experiences involving threats of Hell and general hatred. So, when I saw this anime described as a 'Christian fairytale', I sighed and decided to forget about it...And yet, half a year later, I realised just how wrong I was.It is difficult to pin a genre on Haibane Renmei - it begins in almost Kafkaesque fashion, with a young girl falling through the air. Then a group of angel-like creatures, the Haibane, find a cocoon growing in the basement of their sprawling old-fashioned residence, with the girl inside. She hatches into a world surrounded by walls, populated by Haibane and humans, and run by a race of untouchable masked beings. She grows her wings, receives the name Rakka (\"fall\"), ponders her origin, befriends endearing but mysterious Reki, and, in her first winter, suffers a sad loss. Thus begins her journey, and the viewer's, to understand those recesses of our minds we are sometimes afraid to know.Haibane Renmei's success lies in its depiction of human emotions. There are no guns, explosions, annoying voices and large breasts here. The viewer is simply invited to clear their mind and watch as the lives of the Haibane unfold against a backdrop of a town pleasantly embedded in the past but holding its own secrets. The joy of friendship; the pain and guilt of losing a loved one; the quest towards finding one's identity are the predominant themes of Haibane Renmei.Another great success is the openness for interpretation. Although the story can be seen as religious, it never preaches, never attempts to convert, and ensures that 'sin', 'heaven', and 'salvation' remain only particular words chosen to describe universal concepts. Certain questions pertaining to beliefs are intentionally left unanswered. What lies beyond the walls? Where do the Haibane eventually fly to? And, most importantly, what are the Haibane and what is their purpose?Although the first few episodes seem innocent enough, Haibane Renmei quickly becomes deep, dark, and sometimes filled with nightmarish imagery and symbolism. There is also a subtle, but definitely present theme of suicide and self-injury (both physical and psychological) that is more disturbing than most 'horror' anime. Add to that the slow storyline, and lovers of light entertainment will certainly not find much in Haibane Renmei, unless of course they are willing to look.So, my advice to potential viewers: approach this beautiful series with an open mind, and a willingness to do some soul-searching. At times, Haibane Renmei does leave one feeling like a soul trapped in an endless painted tunnel. But be willing to see the light at the end of this tunnel, that is what Haibane Renmei urges the viewer. Be it faith in a higher power, be it faith in humanity, be it faith in a specific person or be it faith in oneself, the light never truly fades.",
        "While skimming through the series again, I just realized what makes Haibane Renmei such a great work.Haibane Renmei doesn't tell you the answer. It lets you question, ponder and contemplate about it.\"Starting an important question in life and letting it maintain in you.\"... that is why Haibane Renmei is a great work. There is no meaning nor need for an answer. The answer would only become a mere piece of knowledge if you simply tell someone. It is something you should go through all the experiences and realize for yourself. Having the question and keeping it will be the starting point which evokes you to find the 'real' answer.* p.s. * There is a type of a question -somewhat a strange oxymoron-isque question- Buddhists throw at someone when the question of 'truth' is sought after. The way to go through this question is just to keep questioning it in the head ALL the time, even when you're asleep. Suddenly, all the dots will be connected and the answer will just pop up in the blink of an eye, like 'ah, that's so obvious...!' The basis theory behind it is on the assumption that you already know everything, it's just that you haven't 'realized' it yet. Haibane Renmei makes you do that.",
        "Haibane Renmei is an anime series based on Yoshitoshi ABe's (Serial Experiment Lain) doujin with the same name. Haibane Renmei tell us a story about a girl that wake up from a dream as an angle-like creature. She doesn't have any memories from her past so she need to accept that now, she's part of the Haibanes (Grey Wings) humans with grey wings and halo.At first you might think this as a light hearted anime as the main character, Rakka (a name given to her) try to settle in the new town where she live now. Guided by the other Haibane and the Haibane Renmei (Haibane Federation), Rakka try to live her new identity as good as possible. But then the direction of the series begin to change. Haibane Renmei change from a simple slice of life anime to a complex psychological drama that questions one's value and purpose. Themes like sin, despair, sacrifice, death, and even suicide are illustrated beautifully either explicit or implicit in the story. Every characters are built with depth and it's hard not too love them. It took quite a thinking to explore the hidden message or the meaning for every symbol in the story but it sure is one of the best story in anime history.Unfortunately, the animation of this anime is not the best. Inconsistent character design, lack of detail, and lazy animation are the main issues of this anime. From 13 episodes of this anime, maybe only half of them that have really good animation. But i love the atmosphere of the world of Haibane Renmei, although the world is peaceful and full with kind people, there are mystery and gritty darkness hidden in every corner.The music by Ko Otani is amazing. Mostly, Haibane Renmei's scores are sad and depressing, but it's beautiful and it really fit with the tone of the story. The voice actress are amazing, Ryo Hirohashi as Rakka and Junko Noda as Reki are extremely good at bringing their characters to live.Haibane Renmei may have a slow pace and the story might not fit for everyone but if you can capture the beauty inside, there is no doubt that this is the most beautiful anime ever.",
        "What I see in the show, is the great, great, GREAT animation and artwork of Yoshitoshi ABe. its not to show off what anime really is to people surrounded by Pok\u00e9mon or dragonballZ...but to show off how well ABe can build characters and towns and an entire world with so many differences that it would astound the minds of \"hit\" movie watchers.Its not mass marketed for everyone. I would relate it to movies like SLC punk, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Chungking Express, and Requiem for a Dream. They all try and challenge you to see the deep meanings behind the screen.Music. Music can make or break a movie, and if it makes it, it either builds it up, or points it in a direction you didn't see before. The music in Haibane Renmei made it and it built up big time. The music gives it a deep RPG feeling, without the tedious and repetitive battles.final opinion: not everyone will want to watch it, but having it in your collection is the anime version of having a 1830's bottle of wine in your wine cellar.",
        "SPOILERSOne of the most beautiful anime I've ever seen: Haibane Renmei tells the story of a weird afterlife, where angels (the Haibanes) and ordinary people coexist in a small town surrounded by a huge wall, meant to protect them from the outside. Some elements are taken from Christian mythology, but mainly this is an extraordinary and original tale: in this place the Haibanes loose their very personal memories and they're given a chance to loose the remnants of their sins (like in the purgatory). Some are without a sin, others carry a burden from their previous existence: burdens from a present day society, where loneliness and desperation are deep within the people. Abe's suggestive loaded oil (?) paintings pop up here and there and the background music is perfect, what else can we wish for?",
        "This anime is a slice of life, a genre which has since been over thrown with titles about school students drinking tea or tragedy. Not only that but this is a supernatural slice of life a sub genre which really doesn't interest me as a whole. The idea within Haibane Renmei is that similar to angels being re birthed into a world confined within the walls which surround the town that has volunteered to look after them. The protagonist of this series is perhaps the one most interested in the walls and after tragedy within the town she is more determined then ever to see. The anime delivers a bunch of different feelings to the viewer such as Joy, Melancholy and Relaxation, It is a beautifully animated anime which even that is out shined by its magnificent music choice, It is a simple story of sorrow and friendship and is an anime which I will not be forgetting any time soon, The only, perhaps, fault I have with this anime is the animation style of the characters, but since it was animated in 2002, I think we can let that one slide.",
        "\"Haibane Renmei\" is on my Top5 'Best Anime Ever' list. It got there instantly, and remains even though I'm continuously filling my DVD shelf with new titles as they come out. And it's been there for some time. Why? Hm... let's talk about that for a moment.First of, it's a journey. Don't be unprepared, this isn't something You watch as a Sunday Timewaster. In short - it's deep, entertaining and full of... well, me. And you. And everyone else.At first, some may think it's about the main character and the events that unfold in regard to her. Then, it quickly becomes a psychological tale about a community, centered around Charcoal and Feathers Federation. But soon afterwards you lose track of things and just watch...This anime becomes your mirror. I know - it may sound almost impossible, but that's the way it is. It has its own storyline and characters, granted, but it really talks about human emotions, the way we react to those emotions and events, and finally - how, and why we interact with each other. I won't say more.It's not just a ride, it's a journey deep into yourself, into that dark room psychologists and psychiatrists always tell you to open. This title slams the door open and drags whatever's inside - out. By definition, this journey must be made alone...... and it must be made, even if only to know - why.",
        "First let me point out I am not a fan of slice of life anime, in fact I try my best to avoid it, but seeing how this anime was rated so highly on myanimelist, and IMDb I had to at least try it.Up front, this anime has so many opportunities to become something great, but it just passed by those to continue its rather dull story. So, if you are an avid anime watcher and want to know what will happen next abandon all good ideas and use the worst one that you think could happen.It has an interesting setting and ideas, but thats it. You can liberality take away the wings, and halos and you could still have the exact same story without any problems. Im tempted to say there was no real plot, but there was some plot, it was just light and kinda fluffy.My biggest issue with this series is how much I wanted something more. After I watched five episodes I couldn't take it anymore and started skipping a minute ahead over and over and over and over, only to find that most of every episode felt like pointless filler and the characters acted/were no different in episode 10 then they were in episode 3. Zero character development.That said, not the worst anime I have seen, but seriously does not deserve its high praise. I can only conclude that this anime is niche and is only really watched by those who specifically like the genre."

    "Great Teacher Onizuka": [
        "I've heard so much about this because the brillant Steven Blum who voiced from Cowboy Bebop was on this so yeah, why not give this a watch? I really liked his character like seriously I would love if Onizuka was my teacher in school lol. It was funny how he beat up the delinquents after taking photos of him with that spoilt rich girl student (can't remember her name) whom he fancies, but ended up that she was along with the delinquents as well! After she did that, I honestly couldn't stand her throughout the series like Onizuka deserves a better woman then her lol!Really good anime to watch if you want to see a gangsta teacher being the main character!",
        "GTO is short for Great Teacher Onisuka. Onisuka is an ex biker who has a long list of police records on himself. He's determine to become a great teacher.the only reason why is so he can check out all the High School Girls. He's a pervert who like looking up girls skirts when they least expected and likes pornography.But as he does his job as a teacher, he finds that helping students is a good thing to do as a teacher. He makes the impossible, possible and he doesn't do stuff you'd find in a regular teacher. Onizuku knows he'll become well known as the best teacher of Japan.It's a cool series. I recommend it to those who want more mature Anime or for Student Teachers who want to find a series they can get advice from.I also recommend reading the manga series too. Because it's like seeing an extended version of GTO with plot holes not included or changed in the anime.It's rated 16 and up for Language, Brief Nudity, Drugs, some violence, and mild humor.",
        "\"Great Teacher Onizuka\" (1999) = 7.6You know, the problem with watching anime from 10+ years ago is that the Japanese voice actors are usually pretty bad, and the english dub is often just as bad. In this case, the dub was better (the voice acting was slightly better, and the translation was far superior to that of the english subtitled version).So, GTO: the Great Teacher Onizuka. He definitely earned his title-with 43 episodes; he took his time, but still, he earned it. GTO is a great feel good anime: there's not a lot of thought provocation, or complex plot lines, or brilliant narrative, just a really fun, simple format that worked for 43 whole episodes, and definitely could've kept going. The best way I could convey my feelings about this anime would be with a silent, ear-to-ear smile and a playful shrug. GTO is a tentatively lighthearted, positively jovial, and unrelentingly playful anime that will surely put a smile on your face.",
        "This was my first taste of Great Teacher Onizuka and I admit when I first heard of it, well I did have reservations until a friend told me of it. So I went to watch the anime and you know what....I didn't regret it at all.This is the series that genuinely captures the spirit of what the manga was supposed to be about, everything was toned down to actual better effect and also all the over the top humor in the manga was out of place in a serious story.I really grew to like Onizuka and other characters that were to be introduced because Eikichi is such a great character he can a pervert but he does use help his students, genuinely cares about them and is willing to go out of his way for them. Extreme measures are always a last resort but the guy can get excitable and is capable of admitting his own wrongs.Also in the anime I felt he was portrayed many times better then the manga. Because in this Onizuka and others were much more human and much was toned down and it didn't exactly follow the manga (which over the top and rubbish to good effect). Also Onizuka in this does not have a invulnerable body he is capable of bleeding and being injured, not to mention he almost dies in one episode.If you're looking for at least practically invulnerable look at the GTO manga with Onizuka walking away from something that should have killed him or left an invalid.Because quite frankly the GTO manga is terribly overrated, mind you it did spawn this anime which actually is better because everyone felt closer in this anime and there was a genuine air of friendship. Also unlike the manga it did not have too many characters, too many characters added made the manga confusing as well as trashy. Also side characters were not underdeveloped in fact it did not neglect good characters like Julia Murai and Tomoko Nomura for instance it gave them more stories and the toning down I thought the toning down of certain things was a good thing.Also some side characters that appeared in the manga not being in it at all was actually a good thing because either they were poorly introduced, poorly developed, did not have a good storyline and/or served no real purpose. In fact I swear quite a few of them only had the purpose of adding more characters, in fact the anime writers did the right thing and gave existing characters more stories.As Bruce Lee said it best \"Less is More.\"Also the anime has none of the galling HYPOCRISY of the manga! In fact the manga Onizuka was a total hypocrite, who did his share of wrongs in the manga and yet never took responsibility for them, some guy with the viewpoint of 'You should take responsibility for your actions', eh?. Fujisawa did an extremely poor job of portraying someone with 'his own conscience' in the manga.I think of all the GTO stuff I think this is the best telling of the story because they gave existing more characters more story rather then adding pointless arcs and new characters like the manga did.Also there were no plot holes in this anime at least none I could see but there was plenty in the manga particularly in the final story arc of the manga there were plot holes in prior story arcs but that one had the most.If you want a GTO TV series stick with the anime and I hope they might decide to remake the GTO Anime that's if they had time for a live one. If they do I hope they do as good job with that one as they did with this anime which actually surpasses its poor and over rated manga which quite sadly did not do its predecessors Shonan Junan Gumi or Bad Company any real justice of any kind.The Great Teacher Onizuka anime was much more Great Teacher Onizuka then anything else, as it kept the nice healthy mix of comedy and drama. It also had a much more lighter air save in the places where it is a drama.Onizuka is far more human and funnier, not to mention more convincing as a teacher, then his manga or his 2012 Live Action depiction. The manga Onizuka was just an pathetic, hypocritical, out of control and egotistical maniac with no regard for people's safety or how his actions reflect on other people. While Dr. Doug Ross from E.R. didn't always think things through on how his actions would reflect on his colleagues, he always got his comeuppance if the situation called for it and always took responsibility. There were times he was frustrated with what was going on. Also Dr. Ross did have genuine good intentions which unfortunately didn't always work out for the best. The manga Onizuka on the other hand never really took responsibility and was completely irresponsible, no matter what Fujisawa says and tries to spin his actions and behavior (and his own bad story telling and structure) that's a fact.Fujisawa did a crap job in presenting what he wanted and Onizuka in the manga was no teacher, in fact Onizuka didn't even bother to teach his subject matter in the manga. In fact Onizuka in the manga was barely if at all focused on teaching. Fujisawa contradicted himself constantly throughout the manga.The second best is the original Live Action Adaptation which starred Takashi Sorimachi and Nanako Matsushima. If you want to find the best GTO go for the anime or the original live action not the awful manga with almost no story structure, poor stories and character development manga or the lame live remake.",
        "Not so much interesting for seinen, too much closet perv for shonen.It is true that some morale is reached in every episode, however what is annoying to me is the quality of the charters: every time a good character is introduced you build up some hype but a few scene/episode afterwards the same person end up doing something very stupid, or perv.This \"exaggeration of the behavior\" is for some episodes acceptable, but for most it is not.Main exception is Murai, who is pretty real person, his mum and a few friends but this is not enough to save the whole series.I left at 20-sh episode, where also the subjects started to be debatable (How to rise a mid-school student as an Idol? No no these are not really my things).",
        "The anime first time came out 1999-2000 wow been 20 years and still is good to this day ! Funny , emotional , and school life .",
        "GTO has got it all comedy, romance, drama, bullying, delinquents... well you may think this is just another anime but I can assure you it's totally worth it and totally lives up to being a classic.The story is about Onizuka Ekikichi, 22 years old and a bonafide virgin. He was one of the most feared gangsters in Tokyo before he decided to become the Greatest Teacher in the world. After a lot of hustling, he finally got to be the homeroom teacher of Class 3-4 of the prestigious Holy Forest Academy. Every character got a peculiar skill set that is used for both good and bad, the scenarios they come up with are too good. The story revolves around him and how he uses his delinquent gangsta tactics to overcome certain aspects of life in the most comedic way possible.The first episode really clicks with everyone, the first episode has all the elements that are later gonna be used in other episodes, if you liked the first episode then I'll ask you to stick around the show no matter what coz of the life lessons you can learn. I'll outright say the story is cliche and they use the same formula, antagonist appears to seem legit unbeatable but Onizuka shows up at the perfect time with a dramatic entry and saves the day. The series deals with a wide array of topics some are way too serious and some are damn funny. I like how they deal with certain hard topics in a spectacular way possible and gives closure and solutions for all. The ending or the final arc seemed rushed but overall a good watch.The animation is good for its time, the voice acting both in sub and dub is stupendous, characters were fun, the opening and ending songs were just too good, the comedic scenes were delivered perfectly. The anime works with any audience, since the ending seemed rushed I'll hop on the manga. Highly recommended!",
        "Just when you thought old was pah!A true classic with many hidden truism about actual life.Stick around till the end; you'll find yourself laughing hysterically one moment and feel righteous indignation well up the next, or tears brimming after that.All in a day's work for GTO or Great Teacher Onizuka as he is called; blowing away the chaff and picking up only the grains of truth in bold, humorous and at times impish ways. Always quick to praise and support the down-trodden. Darn if I didn't pick up a nugget or two of his timeless wisdom!Unreservedly superlative; simply one of the best storylines of all times, executed in a style all its own!See it! That's an order!",
        "This anime is nice. Its a comedy anime, and while watching this anime you will find yourself laughing at the main character as he is so funny. This anime is not only limited to comedy but it also tells us the story of the students and their relationship with teacher Onizuka, and how he solves the problems of students in a funny as well as wierd way. Skip the fillers though.",
        "One gem that was animated by the same studio who made Yu Yu Hakusho, Naruto, Bleach, fushigi y\u00fbgi, and many more that this studio has to offer, this is one Anime I recommend everyone to see.",
        "Before you judge me on this flawless score and think that I have little taste in anime, let me tell you this. I have seen: FMA Brotherhood, Monster, Death Note, Code Geass (both seasons), Clannad, Clannad After Story, Psycho-Pass, Attack on Titan, Hajime no Ippo (all three seasons), Ergo Proxy, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Elfen Lied.... etc you name it. I would give Attack on Titan a 7/10, Death Note around 8/10, Psycho Pass 9/10 and yet I would give this 10/10. Why?Just look at the character development, the humour, the great journey that unfolds. The opening song is great and catchy. The only let down is the animation quality. The drawings are a bit dated but GTO is a classic and we can forgive this minor flaw given that it is an old anime and one cannot expect the budget of Akira to be spent on every GTO episode. Just because I gave this 10, doesn't mean its perfect. It just means its amongst the best I have seen. I will give away more 10s if a medium of entertainment deserves it. Perhaps I have a greater inclination towards the slice of life genre and being a little bit biased here.Regardless, the protagonist of the show is one of the most memorable and fantastic characters to have graced the screen. There is something very likable about him although I can not pinpoint what it is. It is a multitude of things such as his empathy, humour, loyalty, nonchalant attitude etc. MOST of the characters in this anime are unique and have depth which is a rare accomplishment in the anime realm, even highly acclaimed anime fail to do this. Anko, Aizawa, Tomoko, Murai, Kikuchi, Kanzaki etc are all fascinating characters that have great depth and complexity, thereby adding to the awesomeness of the show. Look at how many names I have mentioned and there are more. It is an uncommon feat to have developed this many characters to a good level. Pound for pound in terms of character depth/development, GTO blows shows like Attack on Titan out of the water, this planet and the Solar System. If you have a keen eye and great appreciation for characters, you will know what I mean. On top of that, most of the characters are interlinked and we learn about their difficulties and how they cope and mature. I am very objective when dissecting an anime or any creative piece of medium/work when finding its flaws. Apart from the GTO's drawings, I could not see any conspicuous flaws that could detract from the quality of the show.Some of the most interesting characters in anime in general that have caught my eye are L from Death Note, Holo from Spice and Wolf, Son Goku from DB, Takamura from Hajime no Ippo etc. Onizuka easily ascends to the ranks of anime's greatest pantheon. This show is old and still packs a great punch. Such an enjoyable watch. I wish I had such a fun school teacher back in the days.Do yourself a favour, give this one a go. I cannot guarantee that you will enjoy it as much as myself. However, I can guarantee that the characters are just on point, well developed and a major contributing factor for the success of this vintage anime. I can not eulogise this anime any more. It is a paragon within the slice of life genre. Final Verdict: 10/10.",

        "Onizuka, everybody's ideal teacher.\nGTO was a bumpy and fun ride. Beginning was good , fresh and relatable to some degree then the middle was a bit bland and it gets good towards the end .\nEnding was disappointing, though.",
        "I saw this pop up on the top 250 TV list and gave it a go completely blind. It might take some getting used to, but by the time i finished it i felt it was worth it. This is a fresh, easy going and somewhat bold for today's age but ultimately lighthearted school comedy that instead of focusing on students it highlights this unorthodox, unkempt and somewhat infantile but ultimately persistent guy.While at first i found him to be kind of unbelievable, by the end of the day he won me over. He can be pervy, lazy and juvenile beyond belief at times but then lazer-point focused with his peers and with a \"head on his shoulders\" attitude. He uses his streetsmart ways to teach those who wrong him a lesson, which is the show's beating heart. He's somewhat uncaring but it comes across as a big brother'ish, you know? Fueled by his teenage desire of women, making a mess where he sleeps at but ultimately with his head straight, treating his young folks equally and pushing them to achieve what they want.\nIt becomes this big brother'ish i-wanna-look-up-to figure.Even if for comedic effect it's something as childish as pulling a prank on a bratty girl that a shy kid doesn't get along with, between lines you learn something on forgiveness, solidarity, honesty, and heck, even sacrifice.This day and age the animation is going to look dated, while that's something time itself won't deny, the characters shine through. As well as the show's emphasize on lewd pervyness could be horribly mistaken nowadays or labeled as \"sexist\" but it's the show's pervyness that touches on the teen sensibility, as well as focusing the least perfect side of Onizuka himself that ends up being countered by his larger than life determination.The show also pokes fun at the school system and this battling with Onizuka's philosophy ends up making him look as both a big brother/someone you'd die to have as a teacher, period. It's about understanding the other ones and fighting this adult stubbornness that obstacle the learnings of life and making the young ones feel like they matter.And it's quite something. It's gotta little bit of comedy, drama, life lessons. A lighthearted, fun, life reflecting old anime is sometimes what you need to make a difference.Sorry for my English.",

        "If u want my honest opinion, it is a good anime worth one time watch but still nowhere near \"the best anime\" category like everyone in the anime world claims.The character Onizuka is a 13 year old hormonal guy's fantasy where he stays relevant even in his lameness and is very intriguing to women for some reason.The worst character in the drama being the Onizuka's student's mother who always seems to be desperate to go out on a date wearing the most \"flirty\" clothes even to her child's school. Mind you, this is Japan we're talking about, what do think might happen to kid and his social life? And after all that his mom shamelessly takes Onizuka's side even in front of her own kid. Actually, I can understand, she secretly hates her own child for having him so young and honestly speaking I am not surprised why her husband dumped her. Even I would dump her myself if I were in his place. (The problem is not her dating but, the way her priorities line up).Rest of the drama is unreal circumstances in a realistic space like a simple school premises and, that is precisely where the problem lies. A lot of over the top stuff could have been easily over looked had character and storylines a bit over the top. But, here it's just a delinquent being a school teacher so, th circumstances presented seems a bit unreal and sometimes repulsive to me.But, there sure are some moments that u will cherish in the drama. Basically, it's not totally bad, it's good but doesn't live upto the hype tho.",
        "Great Teacher Onizuka is by far one of the best anime I have come across. It has every thing that you would look for in a anime- comedy, action, romance and drama. The opening and closing songs of the anime are one of my favorites.The anime is about a guy called Onizuka who is portrayed as a 'pervert'. He earns his teaching degree, just barely, at a second-rate college. He is hired as a long-shot teacher by a privately operated school, to tame a class that has driven one teacher to a mysterious death, another to nervous breakdown, and one other to joining a cult. He embarks on a mission of self-discovery by breaking through to each student one-by-one, and helping each student to overcome their problems and learn to genuinely enjoy life, using his own brand of philosophy.When I came across this anime, I decided to watch it for two reasons 1) It wasn't about some ninjas running on water or humans talking to ghosts 2) It was supposed to be perverted :p Every episode, I laughed and laughed till my stomach hurt and my friends wondered if anything was wrong with me! I realized that the anime was not about perverted jokes but about things beyond that. It was about life. Onizuka takes us on a journey where we learn the importance of life, the important things that we need to have and the way we need to lead our life, in his perverted yet adventurous style! Its a journey that we must admire, a journey that you'll not regret, a journey of laughter is what GTO is all about.The Greatest teacher- Eikichi Onizuka(22 years old and virgin) is awaiting to give you life lessons, so take the lessons that you'll never forget!9.5/10",
        "this is definitely a must watch for any anime fan. this series is full of amazing life lessons and you can learn allot from it. the characters are enjoyable, you see them grow throughout the series into better people. the opening songs are great! this series is a masterpiece, what a shame their wasn't more episodes.if you are also trying to like anime again this series helped me with that problem i was so starstruck after watching this and have re-watched the series 5 times.",
        "It is like Dead Poets Society meets \u9752\u3044\u6625.You need to know/accept three things before you watch the anime though.1. Onizuka's body is invulnerable. He is basically a T-800 model Terminator.2. It contains a lot of fan service. High school girl legs, breasts, even panties. And also lots of handsome guys with thick arms and perfect abs etc.3. A 22 years old bachelor guy can have the humanism and the understanding of human psyche that can only be matched by of Toltstoy's.I won't say it is the best anime I have ever seen, since I would have to elaborate why it is better than the others but I can say that it is the anime I love the most. It is the most extra-ordinary thing that this kind of material would come from Japan, but it may also be that there was no other way, that it would have only been made by a Japanese, by an extra-ordinary Japanese person, Fujisawa Tohru, \u85e4\u6ca2 \u3068\u304a\u308b\u5148\u751f.I think it's a contribution to culture/literature in a universal scale.== spoiler == I think Urumi Kanzaki is the young and female version of Hannibal Lecter. As attractive and dangerous as he is.== spoiler ==",
        "I wish there were more.Hearth warming, funny, surprising, and clever",
        "Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO), is one of the greatest anime that one could see.The animation might be a little rough around the edges since it was made in the early 2000's, but the whole show makes up for it 100%.Without a doubt, the anime gives of a sense of harmony and peace on anyone who watches, and the carefree personality of Onizuka really helps anyone to relax and feel ready for the next day.The show has one hidden trait. It teaches people so many message through its' fine art of storytelling, that in every episode, the watcher learns something about themselves.I could go on for days. But if you truly want an anime that is realistic, but also optimistic in the humoristic sense of Onizuka, and which also makes you think about life and dream, then this is your anime.",
        "I watched it in 2021 but still the anime is the best I've ever seen. The ending was so sad and touche. I wish they made another season just to end the anime happily but still soooo much satisfying.",
        "I love this show as seen some scenes of it and as 13y old student and watched it already 2-3 times.And sometimes think of recommending this to my sister but I can't because she doesn't knows the difference of anime from K-Drama\nBut I would still at least want my bud to watch this show for sure.",
        "I found it very engaging and humourous anime to watch. And I really want to watch more of it. Onizuka will be always very close to the heart character for me. \ud83d\ude0a May be after a while I will watch this series again. The Student and the bonding between teacher and student has been shown so well that I felt nostalgic some of the time while watching it. I really don't know why they haven't made further season of it! Hope they can read all of the reviews and take suggestions from the viewers to come up with other seasons of GTO\ud83d\ude01.The series is complete package of comedy, nostalgia, satire \ud83d\ude01. Watch it you won't regret \ud83d\udc4c"

    "Spice and Wolf": [
        "So this is the first season (I reckon) of the Spice and Wolf series. It introduces us to the wolf which her name is Holo and a merchant named Lawerence. Before watching this anime, I never thought it had a second season and I was so stoked when I found this out because I really wanted to see Holo & Lawerences relationship develop even more! I like the fact Holo was always wanting to try human wine and she was always annoying Lawerence when she gets drunk. I never ever seen such a man get so patient with a woman before especially on an anime!Now for the next review for the season 2 of this anime!",
        "After watching the whole episodes of season 1 and 2, I really thought this anime was brillant by showing off its medival and fantasy side. We get to see Lawerence and Holo becoming more attached to each other. It really is a sweet anime if you like slow romance. Holo is so cute when shes in her human form with her cute wolf ears and tail. However, she looks pretty epic when she's in her wolf form and like, you don't mess with this wolf chick or shell eat you lol! Seriously though, it was great to see a different anime with having a girl as a wolf and the boy as a gentlemen merchant!Definitely a 9/10 for me!",
        "This is one of the nicest anime I have ever watched. The chemistry between Lawrence and Holo is wonderful to behold. This is not an action series, it's a series about the relationship between Lawrence and Holo and their adventures together. This is a good one for the whole family.",
        "When I first learned about this series, I was naturally curious because there hasn't been anything like this before. Going into it, I was amazed of how well-made Spice and Wolf really is. Right from the first episode, this series left such an impact on me that it is difficult to describe the beauty of it and the direction the story went through.So here's how it goes: Young merchant Kraft Lawrence goes from town to town selling products from wheat to furs. While going through the town of Pasloe, he encounters a mysterious being: Holo, the wolf-like deity of harvests in the form of an amazingly beautiful young woman. Together, these two go about traveling from town to town making intricate business deals, having witty and thoughtful conversations, and trying to avoid the attention of the Catholic Church that will like nothing more to destroy poor Holo. As the couple continue heading towards Holo's original homeland, both begin to develop fond feelings for each other.Spice and Wolf is quite different from other anime I've seen. Character development is superb and the interactions between the characters are a load of fun to watch. The animation is top-notch and the music is incredibly compelling, suitable for certain scenes in the episodes. I am actually moved by all this and any series that can do that certainly deserves more than enough credit.The two protagonists are the ones that make it all possible. Lawrence is very interesting as he is knowledgeable in the art of trading. He's also a guy you can count on to have your back and he can usually turn a bad situation around no matter the stakes. Holo is probably the best anime woman I have ever seen. She's fun, clever, and is able to stand up for herself. Holo is also very easy on the eyes, from her soft hair to her stunningly beautiful eyes. For all this, this wolf girl is not without complexity as she has some vulnerable emotional qualities that make her pretty sympathetic. The combined qualities and compatibility of Lawrence and Holo are what truly drive this series.Overall, Spice and Wolf is a compelling tale you would not want to miss. It is so well made that it begs to be more recognized by the world for it's story, characters, animation, and music. It has some good themes to keep it going and the drama really pulls some heartstrings. It is highly recommended that you check this series out and enjoy.",
        "Spice and wolf tells the story of a young merchant called Lawrence and a wolf deity called Holo. They start to travel together to get Holo back to hear hometown. This anime is a bit older ,now around 15 years and it was very good. It covers the first 4 volumes of the light novel series relatively faithfully. Holo is a very interesting female lead. The animation looks quite good for 2008-2009. Holo and Lawrence bicker a lot,but they care about each other. The remake has been announced for 2024. I am glad that the leads are gonna be voiced by the same voice actors. Overall,very good and sweet anime.8,5/10.",
        "Spice and Wolf.Now this is how romance in animes should be dealt with. I was kinda hesitant at first to watch it as I don't like romance focused stuff but boy does this anime deliver on that front in a fresh way. The story is good and its progression is great. It focuses on the characters. The old times setting and merchant stuff gave it an adventurous touch. The protagonist is a likable kind hearted merchant who is really good in what he does and has a mind for profit. His thinking is analytical, always weighing Then there is Holo, the female main character of the anime, who I think is one of the best female anime characters I have seen. She is wise, intelligent, funny and witty, not to mention REALLY GOOD looking. And she is in no way ANNOYING, which was the biggest surprise for me as female characters in animes, especially romantic ones, tend to be annoying. The love story between the two main characters is handled masterfully. Both of them undergo a lot of character development and have diverse personalities that you can't help but enjoy it. The anime focuses a LOT on merchant stuff too. Trading, currencies, techniques, stock prices etc etc. I was baffled at how much detailed it was. Hell, one could learn a thing or two from this anime about that stuff. :pSoundtrack was pretty good. Some of the emotional scores and the comedy ones were GREAT. Animation/art wasn't outstanding or anything but it looked good. If only it was a little longer. I felt that season 2 ended a bit abruptly, I was hoping for a little more of the journey. 8.7/10",
        "Here's a Dengeki Bunko series that is a refreshing trend-breaker in my opinion: Spice and Wolf. It is an adventure/drama anime that feels more like a medieval folktale than an actual TV series, at least to me. It takes place in a fictionalized version of the real-world time period of 14th century medieval Europe, specifically when the Roman Catholic Church had power over even royal families. The show follows the main character Craft Lawrence, a somewhat greedy travelling merchant, in his journey to the fictional far northern city of Yoitz in order to bring his traveling companion Holo back to her hometown.The first thing I absolutely loved about this show, especially in the first season, was just how refreshingly different this show felt from the usual trendy anime affair, which actually makes sense to me because - as previously mentioned - this series takes place in the 14th/15th century time period of Europe. For example, historically speaking, high schools wouldn't even be created until roughly 400/300 years later, so the idea of high school characters being in this series was completely and entirely absent.But on the topic of the absence of high schools and/or high schoolers, this wasn't the only anime trope this show was lacking. As a matter of fact, this show is lacking nearly every overused anime trope ever, at least in my opinion. There are no girls wearing short skirts, the extremely small number of females in this show are just as capable as the males, and, most importantly (at least to me), the nudity is often overlooked rather than blatantly acknowledged.Another thing I liked was how the main characters weren't klutzy or anything to that effect. In fact, they were extraordinarily clever and overall intelligent. And surprisingly, I found that Holo was the character I enjoyed more than Lawrence. She was exceptionally clever, she had personal problems, and she was an outright sassy yet enjoyable smartass a majority of the time she spent on screen. However, that's not to say I didn't enjoy Lawrence as well. He was extraordinarily experienced, he also had his own share of personal issues, and he generally did his best to keep situations professional.One other thing I enjoyed was how the series as a whole felt like a legitimate storybook folktale in a similar vein to the classic Paul Bunyan or Johnny Appleseed stories. For me, everything from the first season's theme songs (the opening theme being On a Journey by Natsumi Kiyoura, and the credits theme being Ringo Biyori ~ The Wolf Whistling Song by Rocky Chack), to the overall atmosphere and aesthetic of the series to the story as a whole was enough for me to feel like I was back in kindergarten reading a classic folktale.Also, after I rewatched this series in the English dubbed version, I freaking love the voices that every character was given, as they felt much more like their personalities storywise. For example, Holo sounds like a dignified goddess instead of a youthful girl, Lawrence sounds like a gruff merchant instead of a teenage boy, and the same pattern applies to many other characters as well.I actually didn't have any personal issues with anything in this series per se, but there was one thing I certainly felt could've been done better. This problem I speak of is how the characters explaining certain things wound up getting more than a little boring as a teenager, which caused me to stop watching after about halfway into the series back then. It was only when I began to watch this series again in preparation for this review as the adult I am now that many of the things the characters were talking about and/or explaining started to actually bore me less and even made much more sense to me, now that I'm older. Back then, most things they were explaining in the show confused me beyond recognition. Other than this, however, I have just about no complaints whatsoever. At the end of the day, Spice & Wolf was an extremely different story than the usual Dengeki Bunko anime, but still had an overall execution that left me feeling it was meant for adult minds rather than people in their late teens.",
        "So I wasn't sure how much I'd like this one at first. I saw it classified on Wikipedia as a romance and this is typically not my favorite genre. Thankfully, the romantic story is secondary to the main plot. I was grateful for this, for had it been the other way around I think it may have become tedious. The main stories revolve around the business ventures of Lawrence and Holo as they journey to Holo's ancient homeland hidden somewhere in the distant north.Now one might think that a story centering on the business dealings of a traveling peddler might be mundane, but they actually succeeded in making it rather exciting. And while so many other non-comedy animes have mortal peril as the main consequence of failure, and while Lawrence and Holo both certainly have brushes with death, it is just as often that the potential cost of failure is Lawrence's financial ruin and bankruptcy. I found this to be refreshing.One of the coolest things about this anime is that it is actually educational. It provides a (very basic) crash course in basic economics and touches on such subjects as supply and demand, market trends, currency trading and speculation, and others. The downside is that if you're like me and already have a relatively good understanding of these things the explanations in the show can come off as long- winded and a little tiring. However I absolutely appreciate the show's effort at being educational.As for the romance angle, I felt that it was handled well. It is by far the secondary plot of the show and it rarely overstays its welcome. The only problem that I have in this regard is that Holo is an extremely violent person and often ridicules Lawrence and even goes so far as to shove, slap, and punch him. Sorry, but if domestic violence against women isn't okay then it shouldn't be okay when it's a woman striking a man. This is a common anime trope that has always bothered me and Spice and Wolf is simply the latest specimen.Oh, and I also have to say that the English dub is incredible, especially the voice of Holo (Brina Palencia). Truly one of the best dubs I've seen recently.And finally I will leave off with one more complaint. The ending is, in my opinion, not satisfactory at all. If I understand correctly, the anime only covers about 1/4 of the manga so there really isn't any true resolution in this show. But all in all I liked it very much.7.5/10",
        "The plot: Kraft Lawrence, a 25 year old peddler travelling from town to town selling and buying various things to make a living during a period much like Europe in the Middle Ages. One night when stopped at the town of Pasroe, he finds in his wagon a 250 year old pagan wolf deity girl named Holo. She appears to be that of a 15 year old girl, except for a wolf tail and ears. She introduces herself as the town's goddess of harvest who has kept it blessed with good harvests of wheat for many years. Despite having the responsibility to watch over the town, she wants to go back to her homeland in the north called Yoitsu, she believes the people have already forsaken her anyway and that she has kept her promise to maintain the good harvests. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the church.This show is so good. Holo is a great character. Kraft Lawrence is also a great character too. But the rest of the characters are assholes. The chemistry between Holo and Lawrence is amazing and believable. The romance is subtle and realistic.The music is amazing, it can be calm then fast. The animation is beautiful, the backgrounds look very good and the characters look really good and expressive.The voice acting is good in both Japanese and English.I wish there were more episodes and seasons :(Overall, this is an amazing amine with great characters, beautiful animation and incredible music 10/10",
        "The characters are adorable, and if you like economics it has a lot of interesting points, but in the show they don't stop saying that the main character is a good merchant when in fact he barely escapes debt and bankruptcy in many stressing situations along the show. I know that if everything is simple and easy this show wouldn't be as interesting, but there are too many of these situations.\nIt a lot frustating that he isn't stronger to defend himself when he gets betrayed by a lot of people, it's like he has supreme luck to manage to keep alive but just that, never geting a better situation.\nWe, as viewers are told he has great intuition for bussiness, but it's showed in the complete opposite, for example when he makes a deal trusting a complete stranger (final chapters of the second season).\nAt least, Holo is adorable as hell ^^",
        "This show is absolutely fantastic. For one thing, the voice actors actually make you feel like the characters are real. Another is the superb story line. Along with those, it can be educational throughout most of the series. It deals a lot with the Stock Market and Tradings. I've learned more about that kind of stuff by watching this then school could ever teach me.Summaries:Season 1: It starts off with a merchant by the name of Lawrence Craft finding a 15 year old girl in his cart, with wolf ears and a wolf tail, who then tells him she is the goddess known as Holo. He then lets her tag along with him as he travels all across the world, trying to earn the money to open up his shop, until she gets back to her homeland, Yoitz. Along the way, they run into a bunch of trouble, involving people capturing Holo and trying to sell her to the church so that they can \"Purify\" Holo, to Lawrence going completely bankrupt after the stock market crashes on all the items he had in his cart, to Holo spending all of his money on Apples, Clothing, and other things she wants. After the stock market crashed, Lawrence regains most of his money by smuggling gold in the bellies of some sheep in which belong to a Shepherd which they befriend. The smuggling goes wrong at one point in which some people that were helping them turn on Lawrence and try to keep the gold for themselves, but he solves that problem by letting Holo transform into her true form and wiping them out, but the Shepherd tries to attack Holo. Over all the noise, Lawrence calls out either the Shepherd's name or Holo's as he's trying to stop them from killing each other. In the end, Holo demands to know who's name he called out, but he never really gives her a direct answer.Season 2: In my opinion, better then the first season. It starts off with Holo having a dream about how over the years, as she never ages, all of her loved ones die as the years go on. She then wakes up and Lawrence and her are traveling to a city, where they meet Amarte, in which Lawrence tells Amarte about Holo's debt to him (Due to all the money she's spent with his money) and that being the reason she's traveling with him, to repay her debt, which then leads to Amarte willing to buy Holo off of Lawrence and allowing her to go free, and possibly, in Amarte's head, marrying her. Lawrence then takes the deal thinking that Holo will continue traveling with him either way, but then he goes to a witch and starts asking her about Holo's homeland, Yoitz, in which he finds out it may or may not exist anymore. He doesn't tell Holo, but she eventually finds out that he'd been keeping it a secret, and she starts freaking out about her becoming all alone, which then for some reason, Holo tells him to \"Make love to me\" so that she will get pregnant and that there would be 2 of her so she would never be alone, but Lawrence refuses to, which results in Holo leaving. In order to regain her back, Lawrence tries to repay Amarte for the contract by trying to gain a bunch of Fool's Gold which is at that moment selling for an outrageously high price, and then it gets into some really confusing stuff, until the end where Holo then returns to Lawrence and continues traveling with him. After that, they come to a town where they stay at an inn, in which Lawrence meets a hooded woman that tells him about a great business deal in which she partners up with him and they make tons of cash. But then, a bunch of stuff happens and the details get amazingly hard to explain, and it all results in Holo wanting to know what she is to Lawrence, even after she made the deal, in which Holo would either leave Lawrence due to the deal going well and him being able to open a shop, or the deal turning on him and her running away, and the woman turning on Lawrence and trying to kill him. In the end, she knocks him out and leaves the deed to the inn he was staying at on Lawrence. He then goes to Holo, tells her about everything that happened with the deal and how it had gone wrong, and then she starts yelling at him, then he tells her he loves her. It gets really emotional after that, then he kisses her, and they continue their journey together.The thing I loved most about season 2 was that it leaves room for a season 3. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Midevil Times, the Stock Market, or the Romance genre. 10/10 easily.",
        "+++ mild spoilers ahead +++It's truly fascinating what you find if you keep clicking through the recommendations list on IMDb for a while. So I ended up on \"\u00d4kami to k\u00f4shinry\u00f4\" or the rather amusing English title \"Spice and Wolf\". With the official website URL being www.spicy-wolf.com I guess you can already be sure that spicy is related to the wolf and not to Lawrence's trading business. ;) I wonder why they went with the strange English title \"Spice and Wolf\" instead.Being only 12 episodes (plus an additional OVA) the main plot is told rather quickly. Lawrence, trader and later dubbed softy by his companion, finds the wolf goddess Horo sleeping in his cart one night. And from then on things go strange ways. It's quite obvious that the story takes place in times of change. In a world where the church is gaining influence with whatever methods they see fit, there is little place for a god people pray to for a good harvest. As people's faith in Horo diminishes there is no more place for her in the old village. So she sets out as Lawrence's companion on a journey returning her to the north.Contrary to, for example Wolf's Rain, Horo is not a wolf that changes back and forth, but rather drawn the furry way, human girl with tails and ears forming out of her hair. Almost exclusively naked in the first episode ^.^ but they dropped this rather quickly in the following episodes. Well OK, it would draw way to much attention in the world they travel. I guess that first episode is where the title Spicy Wolf truly fits. *cough*The dialogue between Lawrence and Horo is truly magnificent at times, mostly when they argue over the unspoken topic... their relationship. Well, of course there is none, other than the business part. The \"side plots\" are mostly Lawrences trading business, in which I got slightly lost due to the subtitles rushing by with the speed of light... at least it felt like that.All in all a series well worth finding and who knows, maybe there will be another season! At least the ending didn't exactly end the storyline in any way.",
        "In medieval Germany, a travelling merchant discovers a naked wolf-girl in his cart. Naturally, he decides to explain economic theory to her.For months.Allow me to be brief. Fans of anime who have discovered this anime because of its attractive protagonist will be both disappointed and delighted. Disappointed, perhaps, because every time the show's writers have to choose between showing the pretty wolf-girl and showing coins changing hands, they select the latter. Delighted, however, because the coins rapidly become the stars of the show - and after a few episodes, you'll be as big a fan of them as of Holo.Leaping from one economics topic to another without a pause, Spice and Wolf dabbles in currency exchange, stock markets, coin purity, black markets, insider trading, loans, bargains and every manner of trade under the sun. And you'll barely notice the education. Being whisked along by Lawrence's Holmes-like reasoning on the whys and wherefores of each deal makes for a curious yet entrancing adventure, where most of the battles are in the mind. And with the wonderful interplay of the two leads offering a wonderful backdrop and developing storyline for the money to bounce off, it's an adventure you'd be mad to miss out on.Absolutely recommended.",

        "This is a grand series that builds suspense and action in a perfect blend. It gives you a bit of knowledge too. It can be a bit slow. But be patient because it really pays off. The characters are unique and all have their own different and creative back stories. It also portrays the corruption of the Catholic Church in medieval times. It's representation of the Middle Ages into the Renaissance is crafted well too. Even with a touch of science fiction it feels very realistic. You can really understand the characters as well. They go through situations like we do. The same types of struggles and fights. So it's very great"

And an international hit in many countries. I never heard of it till 2005. And very surprised to learn how long this series is. With almost 500 episodes, several movies, and a handful of OVAs. Detective Conan(Case Closed) should deserve to be a highly acclaim cartoon in any category for Anime.Problem is very few American Anime fans, don't know how great it is or don't know it's existence. If you like Anime with action, comedy, mystery, or just something that'll keep you busy. I guaranteed Detective Conan is unlike the other mystery anime out there.",

But still you know it's him and he doesn't seem to complain that Detective Mouri gets all the credit, or that he's still a kid. This is one of the best anime shows I've seen, and I still love it. Recommended for all anime fans and to non-anime fans who dig murder or mystery or crime stories, this for you.",
        "Here in America this show is called Case Closed which has become my favorite anime/mystery show of all time.For a long time I haven't been an anime fan since I out-grew Pokemon. After I was over Pokemon I thought all other anime shows were just childish and silly, well now I'm happy to have been proved wrong.While some anime shows are just plain wrong for some of them being sexually inappropriate thats something you don't have to worry about with Case Closed. Sure it might have some curse words every now and then but thats one of the reasons I love this show (I don't like cursing but you'll see why I said that in a second). It's full of comedy and surprises without having the kiddie aw's and oh's of such simple little problems. And just adult enough to enjoy and stimulate your mind without worrying about there being some kind of sexual scene coming from around the corner (I know it shocked me to when I first heard of it). This is a purely fun show to watch.It's about a high-school kid named Jimmy Kudo who is a mystery solving prodigy. He lives alone while his parents are away because his mom is an actress while his dad is a famous book writer. He solves cases every now and then for the chief of police Inspector Maguire. One night when he was out with his best friend Rachael Moore there was a murder. Solving it easily he noticed that two of the suspects were in a hurry to get out of there. So then he followed them, then one of the agents knocked him out and gave him an experimental poison but, instead of killing him something really unexpected happens. He is turned back into a seven-year old little boy. By getting help from his next door neighbor Doctor Agasa (who is also a crazy scientist) he learns that to keep him and everyone else he cares about safe he must keep his identity secret even from his own friends and family or else if the agents find he's still alive then they'll come back to finish the job. So he goes to live with his friend Rachael under the name Conan Edogawa. It also turns out that her father is a detective but not a good one. So with the inventions that Doctor Agasa creates for him he helps Richard Moore (Rachael's dad) solve cases and becomes famous while he's back in elementary school. So now he's waiting for the organization to re-appear so he can get the poison they used on him and create an antidote and turn himself back to normal (thats why he's staying with Rachael and her dad in the first place, Richards a detective so he's hoping that somewhere along the line he'll run into them again).I know that some of this stuff sounds a little kiddie but it is a great balance between both. It is funny, full of mystery, while some episodes has action and adventure. A must-see series for any anime and/or mystery fan. And even the comedy makes it worth while for those of you that don't care much about both categories.",
        "Every \"Detective Conan\" story is more boring and trite than a run-of-the-mill, old Sherlock Holmes movie or TV crime drama. Yet somehow the fact that this is an \"anime\" impresses the pretentious brains of those who would probably find the others boring too. I cannot stand the sight of it anywhere on TV or online, the lame pretense of it being \"interesting\" merely because it is \"anime\", aside from the sheer boredom of it.",
        "Detective Conan is a fun show. I've seen subtitled versions of it and it's very good. The series revolves around a teenage detective whiz who is shrunken down to the size of a child by an experimental poison. He must then masquerade as an eight year old (going to school, etc.) while keeping his identity a secret and a look out for the villains that gave him the poison. Helping him is a funny inventor who gives \"Conan\" (an alias the character uses as a child) cool James Bond like gadgets, like a bow tie with a voice distorter and shoes that magnify kicking strength.The mysteries Conan solves each episode are very brain teasing, but nothing impossible if you put your brain cells together and follow the clues. Though many of the cases involve murder (and some pretty elaborate ones at that) each episode is presented in a way for people of all ages, much like how I used to watch Murder, She Wrote as a kid. If the show is ever aired or released commercially in the States, you should try to find it.",
        "This is one of the best show of all time based on one of the best manga of all time. Because is really hard to find translated piece of the manga, people who only speaks English are missing out on this masterpiece. I highly Recommend reading the manga first, I watched the show as a kid so it is really special to me, but looking back, the animation of the early episode was really a product of the 90s, the anime also have a lot of tv original episodes that acts as a filler, they are generally not very good. I hope somebody could translate the manga in English so everyone can see just how good this is.",
        "I am a long time fan of Detective Conan and have watched it since I was a kid: it doesnt deserve a score of more than 7. The arcs in its early seasons are good and interesting, but beyond 1000th, the falling off is noticeable. It is sad the author has become ill and I hope he gets well, but the quality of his story is falling off due to that. Also, don't watch the fillers, you will forget what happens in the canon episodes due to it.The homicides become tedious, murder is half due to cyanide poisoning, which becomes old fast. It shines when it deals with non-homicide cases and those are pretty uncommon.",
        "There is been a long time that I don't make a review on IMDb last time I saw that Detective Conan is top rated TV but now is not. You know that Detective Conan is one of my favorite Series of all time the story is excellent and the plot is amazing this story is about a teen detective named Shinichi Kudo who drugged and incidentally becoming a kid. I don't want to spoil anything you have to watch this anime this is the best crime solving anime of all time you can't predict what will happen and you will be surprise.This anime is a masterpiece Gyoso in his best he can make Detective Conan become something that phenomenal just talk about it make me chills with awesomeness.I very very in love with this anime.Detective Conan is standing tall like the likes of Sherlock Holmes we can say that Sherlock Holmes is Detective Conan and Detective Conan is Sherlock Holmes.I very recommended you guys to watch this anime and rate it. Detective Conan is still had it this is an A star Anime proud of it! 10/10.",
        "I had read about \"Detective Conan\" about a year prior to the show being released in the United States, and so when \"Case Closed\" began airing in May of 2004 I jumped at the opportunity to see this show. I was not disappointed.This show is a welcome relief from the Scooby-Doo inspired cartoons (not to mention Scooby-Doo itself) that presented a \"mystery\" that a tree slug could solve in two minutes. The stories are well thought out, the solutions are NOT obvious but can be put together by an observant (and thinking) viewer, just as Conan does, and best of all the series does not insult the intelligence of its viewers: the show is entertaining without padding 3/4 or the episode with slapstick routines and mindless running from a person in a Halloween costume.The show's premise is that little six-year-old Conan Edogawa is actually a 16-year-old detective prodigy. He was reduced to a grade school child when a mysterious would-be assassin gave him an experimental poison that (unknown to the poisoner) regressed the detective rather than killing him. In a bit of angst reminiscent of the early adventures of \"Spider-Man\", Conan makes a hard discovery: You can have the most brilliant detective mind in the world, but if you're six years old, all the police are going to tell you is, \"BEAT IT, KID!\" In spite of this hardship, little Conan finds ways of bringing the guilty parties to justice -- although all too often, someone else takes the credit for his deductions.HIGHLY recommended.",
        "Broadcasting in he U.S. as Case Closed, Detective Conan is an interesting mystery/comedy/thriller that looks like a kiddie show but definitely ia much more to the series. Plot: a teenage detective protoge is turned into a kid by a weird poison and must help solve cases for his girlfriend's bumbling father under a alias until he can find the people who did this to him and recover an antidote. The premise, like I said, sounds kiddie but as the series rolls on things start to get messy and at times, a bit disturbing, but the cases are so ingenously planned out and executed you can't help but watch just to see how Jimmy/Conan will get the jobs done with such a small guise working against him. The animation is pretty good, bright and colorful though dated (eight years old now) but has its own style of anime. The dub isn't bad either, once again Funimation ,the folks doing the recording down here, have hired some excellent voice talent that matches each characters personalty very well though some tend to overact (the junior agency for example). Overall a great series that blends comedy and mystery very well. The only gripe being its very long (over 100 episodes) but still fun to watch. Give it a watch if you need a break from all the action animes or just a fan of Japanese cartoons in general. As Jimmy/Conan always say: \"With a keen eye for detail, one truth prevails.\"",
        "This is the only abime in the history of anime who's fillers are equally great as the main episodes and can't be missed!!!\nIts long yet everyone who starts watching goes on to finish it. Everyone who has watched it has loved it. All the episodes feature different cases, all impossible crimes and yet conan solves it. It also has few side characters who will make you fall in love with them. Along with the cases the anime also has two parallel stories which are the heart of the anime(one is the black organisation and the other one is the tragic love story of sinichi and Ran). \nJust do yourself a favour and watch it.",
        "This is probably THE most popular Manga-Anime on earth, not only Anime-Fans like it, but others as well. Why? Because even though it is not always a very credible or spectacular series, the detective series and the overall realism of the series make this Anime so comfy to watch, everybody just has to love it!!! For instance, there is no character with blue or green hear and unlike other series, the characters to not yell all the time in an annoying, exaggerated manner.The big pro of the series are the usually very cool and clever plots, sometimes an episode gives you all the hints you need yourself to figure out who the culprit is. Mostly though, an episode does not, or sometimes it's luck which leads Conan to solving a case. Nevertheless, the series is gripping, gives you false leads, is funny and the English subtitles with references and explanations to Japanese culture are excellent.The series earns at least a 9/10. Personally, I gave it a 10, but what I don't like is that throughout the 506 episodes, the real core story about Shinichi and the Black Gang is rarely progressed.",
        "Because it had drama and romance and action is very good I love this anime, and ran is so sad because sanche not with hem",
        "This is the only 1 detective show that gives audience useful hints.Hope they make games of this show.",
        "Although there are many pictures that are not suitable for children, it is a child oriented animation after all. The characterization and content are lack of depth and do not continue to dig deeply - this may not be a problem, but for more than 1000 episodes, all the characters are the same as they were when they first appeared, which is a serious problem. The drama is arranged purely to be able to drag on. 8.5 points is really outrageous, so let's play two stars.Very speechless. In the first dozens of episodes, they were swimming. Later, when they came up, Conan suddenly remembered some clues in the investigation, and then ran out. Is it possible to go to primary school, or Japanese primary school, or to hang out with Xiaolan all day long? Doesn't he need to go to school? Even if he doesn't need Xiaolan, doesn't he? There is also the stem of the rotten man in black. The implementation of more than 1000 episodes, and nothing else. Conan really does not deserve the score of 8.5.",
        "I genuinely hate anime but, this is the one I like I've been watching it since I was 3 and still find it entertaining 12 years later. Best anime.",
        "Every review here will tell you the back story of \"Case Closed\". They'll tell you how the teenage Shinichi Kudo (a genius detective) is given an experimental pill by some thugs and is transformed into a child again. He calls himself Conan Edogawa & wherever he goes, a crime happens & he solves the crime. He keeps his predicament to himself & an inventor friend of his. The inventor gives him Bond type gadgets that help him get by, since he's a child again. One of these gadgets, a bow-tie, changes his voice, so he can sound exactly like anyone. When he solves the crime, he knocks out an adult with a dart hidden in his watch, hides behind the sleeping adult, talks through his bow-tie to sound like the adult & tells everyone within earshot who the criminal is.Now, I love anime & I love this show. But, this is maybe the silliest premise ever in an anime. And it's an utterly useless premise. Having Conan as a child serves no purpose in the show at all. He still acts like an adult & most of the time, he's just hanging out with his girlfriend (who doesn't know Conan is her boyfriend) & her father (who is a detective & a very bad one at that). This little \"kid\" is allowed to walk around the crime scene (usually a dead body) like it's perfectly normal. He sometimes gives the clues he finds out loud. Most of the time, the adults take his advice, other times, they yell at him to shut up, even though he has given clues that have solved the crimes before hand. It just doesn't make any sense. If he's going to act like an adult, just make his character an adult. The side-story of the thugs who changed him is hardly (if ever) brought up again. It's pointless.Luckily, most of the detective stories themselves are great enough to overlook the premise. Well, almost overlook them. Whenever I see Conan crouching behind a chair, speaking into his tie, I cringe at how silly it is.) The characters are realistic & the stories are very dark sometimes. Definitely not for kids (another reason the premise is stupid). The animation itself is top notch & each character stands out, so you can tell them apart when trying to figure out \"who did it\". I do recommend this show to anime fans & people who like detective shows. I would have given it a 10, but the premise is just too ridiculous. Still, knocking it 2 points is not bad.",
        "I've seen 50 episodes as of today and I finished them in two days and am still interested in finishing and catching up with new episodes despite having 900+ episodes. Every single episode is like a breath of fresh air with new and interesting cases. Not one case is repetative (though they retelecasted few episodes by remastering them in animation and clarity, but they're very few in number and they serve as fillers). Comedy, suspense and emotions are in the right ratio. I normally decide if I can watch a show or not within a few episodes and many disappoint me, but this show isn't one of them. Even the cases from 1996 seem so new and unique.My only negative with this show is that (spoilers ahead) Ran still has no idea about Conan's real identity even after 24 years. This is my only problem, though she gets suspicious of him at places, no confirmation on it yet. So cutting a star.Overall definitely a detective show which is worth a watch.",
        "A very good, integrated work. There is no mistake, but his mistakes are the filters from the studio itself, many filters and sometimes ruin the atmosphere of enthusiasm, but a very wonderful work and one of the most beautiful anime that I have seen.",
        "I love watching Case Closed every night so I can figure out some murders. Case Closed is a story of a teenage detective boy who turned into a kid by some poison from two bad mysterious guys who were meant to kill him. The teenager was named Jimmy Kudo. Jimmy also has a girlfriend who doesn't know that Jimmy is a kid. Jimmy has named himself as a kid Conan. This show is a great mysterious show. This show mostly has murder cases. It's always exciting to figure out a case of what happened. Suspects are the ones that make me confused. There was too many suspects that I couldn't solve the case myself. This show is enjoyable to my brother and I.",
        "If you are a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work, this show is a MUST-SEE for you. The show revolves around a young boy by the name of Conan Edogawa. However, this is just the alias of 17-year-old Jimmy Kudo, Japan's most famous young detective prodigy. While witnessing a mob hit, he is knocked unconscious and given an experimental poison that, unbeknownst to his assailants, reverts him to the physical size and age of a second-grader. However, he retained his brilliant mind and vicariously solves some of the most perplexing mysteries imaginable.This is a very intelligent and well-written show and is recommended to anyone who loves a good murder mystery.",
        "This show used to be thrilling when it premiered in the late 90s - esp. to kids of the 90s. But after 20 years, it is running into too many problems that it cannot overcome.On the one hand, the cases (the plots, the methods, the motives) have become somewhat repetitive. In some cases, old cases are adapted in a new setting (sometimes as part of the official tourist attraction program featuring places of interests outside of Tokyo). In this way, it lost the thrill it once had for young viewers.On the other hand, the premise of the show is extended too far that it becomes, i) too silly to be taken seriously, and ii) too inflated to come to a satisfactory conclusion in a couple of shows (one kid vs. an international criminal conglomerate?!).The first couple of years of the show are excellent (the earliest shows are wonderfully dark and superbly scary) and are rewatched again and again. But later shows I only watch sporadically. For truly thrilling, well-developed, and not over-inflated, detective anime (a limited genre in the West), I watch The File of Young Kindaichi.",
        "Being a fan of the comic book series from way back before the anime version came out, I was really excited to see it on DVD.  For one thing, it features intelligent plots, decent characters, and no ridiculous sci-fi/fantasy themes -- aside from the premise and the cool gadgets, anyway. The mysteries are well-formed, and that is an important thing in mystery genre. <p>And, thank goodness, the women dress and behave like real people instead of like the teen-boy-fantasy bimbos in the crummy anime that usually shows up in the English-speaking world. <p>Excuse me.  Back to the review. <p>The story is as follows: 16 year-old high school student Shinichi Kudou is a world-class detective.  He models his deductive technique on that of his idol, Sherlock Holmes, frequently assisting the police with baffling murder cases. One day while on a date, he spots and follows two suspicious-looking men.  They capture him, and, wary of shooting him in public, force-feed him an experimental poison before departing.  Instead of killing him, the poison shrinks Shinichi to the size of a child. <p>Panicked, he runs to Agasa, an old and trusted friend of the family, who is also an inventor.  With this friend's aid, he works his way into his girlfriend Ran's house under the alias of Conan Edogawa (Conan from Arthur Conan Doyle, Edogawa from a Japanese suspense writer).  Ran's father is also a detective, and Shinichi hopes that by tagging along on his cases, he might eventually pick up clues to the bad guys' whereabouts.  Agasa warns Conan not to tell anyone else who he really is.  The bad guys are also looking for him (since there were no reports of Shinichi's body being found, and they're not the kind to let a thing like that go), and anyone who knows anything at all about his real identity will be in serious danger. <p>In the meantime, the detective father is a bumbling, girl-hungry idiot, and Conan soon gets into a routine of solving the father's cases for him without looking like he's doing it.  To allay suspicion, he also enrolls in first grade at a local elementary school. He reluctantly makes friends with his classmates and he and they also have their own share of adventures.<p>Because I've read the series, I was mostly curious to know how the voices would come out, how the producers would set up each plot, and if they would be able to transfer the suspense, drama, and comedy of book form to the TV screen.  All in all, the production and the voice acting is excellent. The producers stick closely to major storylines, and character interaction and development is key to most of them.  The TV version loses some of the intensity of the original series.  It makes sense, however, as the books are geared more toward teens and adults, and the anime more toward children. <p>I have only two objections to the series. One regards the extra episodes which were obviously written to fill out each season.  They don't occur in the books, and for good reason.  One, in which Conan and his classmates have to outwit a bunch of robbers after getting stuck in a department store after closing hours, is pretty good.  But most are terribly farfetched.  The series does much better when sticking with the original story arc. <p>(On a more practical note, marketing for the Meitantei Conan anime in Japan is directed mostly at children. Perhaps the producers felt more episodes with Conan's grade-school friends would appeal to the target audience.  They could still have come up with better ideas, though.)</p> <p>Another objection is the subtitles.  They are TERRIBLE. Not only is dialogue badly translated, but it is also badly spelled.  Whole lines are left out altogether -- and a lot of them are important to making the story make sense!  It's frustrating to see an otherwise perfectly good, well-written series get such sloppy translation. <p>All in all, this is a good series.  Extra snaps to the series for making Ran a karate champion (if you see the show, you'll see what I mean). If you have a fairly good understanding of Japanese, I recommend watching without the subtitles.  It's much much better that way.",
        "Don't get me wrong i love the show and continued watching even after the English dub ended at episode 130. They are overly exaggerated and they assume that the common man has the intellect of a professional criminal. As for the main character, he is always suspicious of every single thing going on even if it would otherwise be irrelevant. For the sake of the story, he picks up clues from analyzing everyone even before anything even happens. As for the police, they listen to the kids and allow them near the dark and graphic crime scenes. He puts Detective Mouri to sleep so easily and nobody even notices conan missing or standing right next to him.I have watched Detective School Q thrice and am going to watch it many more times again. Even though it was pitiful that it had to end at 45 episodes, I will just enjoy it forever. And detective Conan as of now is not keeping me as excited."

        "If you don't mind animated blood and violence ... and crime that is, with suggestive and quite curvy female character to boost with ... well this obviously is for adults and not for kids. A bit of fantasy, a bit of gangs fighting each other and many other themes for the run time of it.I quite liked it, but it may be weary and too long for others. Even though it is only 24 (initial episodes, spin off not included) and the run time per episode is also short and sweet. But I know that doesn't mean a lot for some. Be that as it may, as you can see by the rating in general, this is being regarded well (deservedly so). Good production values and animation!",
        "This series follows Rokuro Okajima; a Japanese salaryman who finds himself taken hostage by a trio of pirates aboard an old torpedo boat. When he learns that his boss has no real interest in him he joins the pirates. The crew consists of Dutch the captain; Benny, a computer and communications expert and Revy, a woman with a bad temper and two guns that she uses expertly. Revy soon dubs Rokuro 'Rock' and this new name sticks. They are based in the lawless city of Roanapur where there must work with and fight against a number of dangerous organisations most notably 'Hotel Moscow' a Russian Mafia run by a woman called Balalaika. Over the course of the series they will have many scrapes and in every one the bullets will fly!I've seen quite a few anime series and think this is one of the best of them. Rock is a great character to introduce the murky world of Rainapur; in many ways he represents the audience; an ordinary person taken into a world he struggles to come to terms with. Rock may bring us into this world but it is Revy who is the real protagonist; she is a great antihero\u0085 she is nearly always angry and never ducks out of the opportunity for a fight. As you might have guessed there is a lot of action in this series and it is all pretty exciting; giving us a sense that the protagonists could be harmed. Inevitably this leads to a few downbeat moments including a couple of real tear-jerking moments. It isn't all bleakness though; there are some laughs to be had; especially in scenes between Revy and a gunslinging 'nun' from the Ripoff Church. This series isn't suitable for younger viewers because of the levels of violence, swearing and one case of extreme, but not graphic, sexual threat but older viewers who like plenty of action should love this.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "This reviewer does mainly standard movies/TV (check out my reviews) but after a friend tipped me to Steins Gate (now seen it twice top to bottom) I was sort of hooked on quality anime.This is my second fave anime. I apply the same standards I apply to film/TV -- the production (writing, audio, effects) has to be good enough to make you feel you left behind your own life and draw you in to another world.(See for example the short-lived series BANSHEE, currently my #1 pick in recent live action TV ... and they shut down the series because they wanted to, not because the ratings were weak).Black Lagoon makes me feel, like the character Rock, I left my world behind. The animation is to die for, the character are unforgettable (love the MAID!) and the dialog in the English dub is sassy.Highly recommended.",
        "I absolutely thought the best scene was on episode 2, Rock gave the finger to the solider helicopter after they blew up. I couldn't stop laughing like it was the most memorable scene ever I've seen on any anime I've ever watched!Although I'm not a big fan of this show, I absolutely appreciate the characters and most of the English Dub cast except for the ones who put on horrible fake accents then using natural accents, but that's for another day to rant on about.The gun fighting and the chases were so entertaining like it has a a bit of sprinkled Hellsing and Mad Bull 34 added in there. IIf you feel like you need a kick ass anime to watch, this ones for you folks!",
        "\"Black Lagoon\" is a team of mercenaries who are hired for all sorts of things! This anime is mostly about their adventures! The action used in this anime is similar to that of a hong kong movie! Mostly it is heroic bloodshed! With some martial arts in it! Although this show has a lot of action it also has some substance! There are some themes in the plot that will make you think! For example there are these twins (little children) who are coldblooded killers! But they are this way because they have been (sexually) abused and forced into this life of crime in a very brutal way! So these victims have become villains themselves! Maybe it is too far-fetched to believe,but in real life these things do happen! What makes this anime so special that there is no real evil and real good,all the characters are all villains! Even \"Rock\" the main character admits being a villain but one who observes! He is the one in the middle of all the things that happen! There are many interesting characters! There are gun blazing nuns, a \"terminating\" maid,killer twins and much much more! There is also \"Revy\", a very attractive Chinese-American woman who rolled into this life of crime with ease! Her nickname is \"Two Hand\" (what do you think she holds in these two hands??? Guns of course!) You will know very fast what makes her special! It is nice to see that among these characters most of them are also gun blazing women who are just as dangerous as the men! There are a lot of jokes in this anime who are actually really subtle! In very serious conversations people constantly are referring to famous movies and actors,which make it a feast for movie lovers!",
        "Black Lagoon probably the most American-like anime to ever come out in Japan and for an anime fan with an undying passion for old school action movies and director Quentin Tarantino like me this series is a freaking goldmine and the best example of how a seinen anime should be. Every single episode feel like a fast paced action movie with unapologetic action scenes and dialogue, not to mention the memorable characters especially the female ones because they are no doubt the most baddest and the most dangerous woman I've come across in an anime. The animation may dated for today standard and the engrish skills of the VA kind of hard to get through but if you a newcomer to the world of anime and want to watch something hit close to home before you explore the more weirder side then Black Lagoon is the perfect choice",
        "A creation of eastern production team Madhouse and American Geneon from an original graphic novel by Rei Hiroe, this is an adult-aimed anime series which turns out well above average, even if not quite on the consistent level as such standalone Madhouse features as Millennium Actress (2001), or Tokyo Godfathers (2003).Much of the particular flavour and interesting tensions within Black Lagoon can be put down to its split production origins, a dichotomy also reflected in dramatis personnel. Besides Dutch there's a Jewish-American (Benny) and Chinese-American (Revy), as well as Rock's Japanese presence. At the same time, set pieces familiar from American action cinema jostle for screen time with characterisation and some graphic styling typical of homegrown manga. As the varied team undertake a series of assignments (at least in First Barrage, the name of the series' initial half, reviewed here), it gradually leads to an escalating tension between Rock and Revy. The new recruit, out of the boardroom and now onboard, so to speak, seeks to establish himself in a new and bewildering world, where he has a chance of gaining the respect previously denied him.Revy has issues and internal strife all of her own, increasingly aggravated by the new arrival. It's the relationship between these two that's at the heart of the series, and gives events a centre of gravity. As white-collar Rock gradually grows into his new relationships, so Revy has to face up to new emotions and truths. Confrontations will make her doubt the real strengths of her much vaunted self-reliance, and how much her troubled past still influences her. It becomes obvious that, despite her best efforts, a problematic relationship is forming between her and the new arrival. Meanwhile, Rock's corporate-inspired guile, outwardly conservative image, and sly negotiating skills gained in a past life prove an increasingly valuable asset, even as he assesses his past existence in the light of the new.Operating out of the south Pacific city of Raonapur as the 'Lagoon Trading Company', Dutch's small professional team one held together by a quirky mixture of greed, bravado and camaraderie. Their main, continuous interaction is with a former Soviet military officer known as Balalaika, a big wheel in the crime world they inhabit and service. She quickly uses the Lagoon Company to help secure her ascendancy. In events after that, concerning a group of Nazis and a sunken submarine, she is largely absent, but comes to prominence again as events proceed, notably during the episodes of The Unstoppable Chambermaid. Here she helps to adjudicate at the finish, bringing to a climax stormy events between Revy and the murderous servant Roberta (a peculiarly enigmatic figure, demure but full of unstoppable violence), which have played out with a due nod to The Terminator. Towards the end of this first series Rock and Revy again provide the most interest from point of character until, at the close, we learn some more about her personal history from the CIA, which continues the process of humanising her, putting her life more in context.It's no surprise then that the closing credits of each show are shown over a notably melancholic sequence, reflecting Revy's trademark emotional desolation. The viewer follows her feet and lower legs along a beach watching her slowly discard cartridges, shoes and trademark twin handguns into the sand. Then, with a final flourish, Revy turns abruptly and confronts us with another weapon, as if warning against any attempt at communication. In contrast to the interest generated by such handicapped and resentful psychology, other parts of Black Lagoon are less rich in character studies, as individuals too readily give up what secrets they have. For instance, the Nazis faced by the team in the three-episode Die Ruckkehr des Adlers sequence are stereotypes, cardboard fanatics with none of the originality we find elsewhere. Only the claustrophobic scenes set inside the sunken submarine, rife again with tension between Rock and Revy, give this section much interest.A good deal of the show is taken up with violent set pieces that, typical of the genre, often bring an episode's climax. This is all orchestrated with some \u00e9lan, but in matters of sex Black Lagoon remains surprisingly reticent. Some viewers will note the coded lesbianism of Balalaika, or the constant smoking and cigarettes, those small symbols of virility, which are passed round or enjoyed by characters during the film. There are the hot pants of the busty Revy, clearly geared towards the fantasies of a male audience even if her continuously sexualised character remains an erotic aspiration only. She even expresses a surprising innocence early on when accidentally confronted by Balalaika's pornography (\"do you mean he is actually going to put that up her ass?\"). Mostly, adult sexuality is confined to the background: mute whores in bar rooms, or the surrounding street life.If the vividly realised experience of Black Lagoon can teach Revy - or us - anything more worthwhile, its the importance of establishing one's place in life with dignity, all the while discovering and valuing real friends. Worthwhile relationships are at a premium in a lawless city such as Raonapur. Those like Balalaika can only purchase the loyalty of associates; Nazis combine together through blind political obedience, Taiwanese assassins are necessarily hirelings, or servants like Roberta remain emotionally stunted. On Dutch's small, intimate boat however, people interrelate on a far more critical level. Here genuine loyalty and trust can quite literally mean matter of life and death.",
        "\"Black Lagoon\" is an anime with very good presentation and good old action scenes.Rarely have I seen a female character as well written as Revy.But unfortunately she is also the character that gets the most focus, while the others only exist on the side and Rock should actually be the main character...\nThe anime deserves a real story in my opinion.Yes, of course the group gets orders again and again, but unfortunately they sometimes seem very monotonous.Nevertheless, \"Black Lagoon\" is a good choice if you're looking for an anime with lots of banging and action, but don't expect an anime with a deep story.",
        "Watched the English Dubbed. The anime revolves around a harbor city Ronanapur- center for drugs trade so we have the Triad,Italian mafia, South American drug lords , Russian mafia in the form of X-military paratroopers and of curse Uncle Sam in the form of CIA operatives. Our protagonist- The Black Lagoon company is a group of 4 doing the transportation/pirate/mercenaries business. Took me time to get the hang of the anime, the starting was too fast for me. Wasn't sure where they were going with the story, add the many American/pop culture reference, as a non-American i wasn't getting the hang of the dialogs.Ones the new recruit Rock settled in among the crew of Black Lagoon i really started enjoying. Ones i got the hang of the pace, i really started enjoying the dialogs. They are intelligent, funny and critical - very realistic. The main characters Rock and Revy change there attitude from having fun to being depressed, from being nice guys to being bad without remorse. Loved all the different characters and there are loads of them. This anime has many complicated bad-ass characters who have the presence of being the main protagonist. The detail going into each scene was awesome. One of the few animation were even the background seemed to be worked upon. Work was done on everything making them look very realistic and stylish. The Action is mind blowing and artistic. Its macho and all done by girls. Girls with balls of steel. Really enjoyed roberta's arc in the end,total bad-ass,although the last episode 29 was a bit of disappointment. Will love some historical arcs on any of the elite citizen of Ronanapur.",
        "Review date: 2014.Animation was ok, art was pretty good, soundtrack was very good, story was great, narrative was really great, characters were wonderul, and it was surprisingly original.For an action-adventure story, this s*** was pretty damn good. It was a simple shoot 'em up type anime, but it wasn't a mindless one. This is how you do an action anime.",
        "You can find Black Lagoon on Netflix and I'd easily recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good adult oriented anime. I've recently watched through episodes once more and I think even after almost 15 years it holds up perfectly.The animation is really well done and I also enjoy the story lines a lot as well as the characters. The main cast is very likable even with their flaws. And quite often you can even feel sympathy for the antagonists.Within the various stories you'll always find the dark themes of loss and tragedy. At the same time the show keeps it entertaining by adding amazing action scenes. They are quite often over the top in terms of what should be possible, but the show keeps it at a level where even though it is ridiculous it's still somewhat believable and also highly entertaining.Most important lesson of this show - Don't mess with maids!",
        "So I will start with the end here.The transition towards the ending credits in the majority of the episodes is so well done that I could watch it over and over again. I sometimes even rewind to find the exact point where it kicks in.It has to be the best fit of everything that was made before and after this. If there is anything that comes close please direct me to it.So a bit premature to rate this as I just finished season2.And I really don't want to write an essay about the character development but I will say this.Character development and storytelling is top notch.So what's it about.Well an officeworker is trying to find his place in the world. And he encounters some people that have done so or are just looking as well.Don't let the officeworker part fool you. There is a lot of violence and some r-rated language in this. But it all serves a purpose.",
        "Black Lagoon is, by far, the most American non-American show I've ever seen. You've got the gun fights, the torpedo boat chases, the Californian surfer dude tech guy, the badass former streetrat chick, the ex-KGB mafiosi, some shifty nuns, and lots of explosions.The series is not only entertaining but often quite mature as well. Some episodes are merely action, especially at the beginning, but others are far more serious, dealing with rather heavy topics. This is especially true for the first arc of the second season (spanning three episodes) and the final arc (spanning six episodes).Nevertheless, Black Lagoon didn't quite manage to captivate me as much as the more dramatic series like Neon Genesis Evangelion or Puella Magi Madoka Magica, most likely because it isn't all that easy to truly connect to the characters. For me, the show ended up in the weird zone between mindless entertainment and philosophical drama, firmly belonging in neither group yet sharing many of their qualities.Still, it's an easy recommendation if you're a fan of the anime-typical art style yet prefer more American storytelling over anime-typical sillyness.",

        "Brutally good and fun with strong characters . Action, good written dialogs makes this a must see. Animation is good but it's the story and the well written characters that makes it such a good anime !",
        "First season is an absolute favorite of mine. It loses a bit of it's attitude after that but still is a very well done anime show. Reminds me of a more in your face version of Cowboy Bebop.",
        "Words cannot begin to describe how much I love and enjoy this show. Black Lagoon is frickin awesome. What starts out as an action show quickly turns into a pretty deep philosophical and existential anime about humanity, morality and nihilism, all the while still sustaining all that awesome action and thrill. This sudden shift in tone surprised me and it made me even more excited and invested in the show. It had the same affect on me that Evangelion had. The dynamic and action that happens within the Lagoon crew is why you watch the show, the relationship between Roc and Revy is why you stay. They're complete opposites yet they learn and teach one another about themselves and about life. It's beautiful to see how their relationship transforms as they become closer to one another. The humanity that lies within these characters is what propels this anime forward and what keeps you wanting more. I always love when an anime doesn't feel like a typical anime and this one definitely is that. I really appreciated how adult and mature it dealt with all it's themes and subject matter. Politics, religion, morality, philosophy, existentialism, nihilism - it covers it all. The show can get really dark and bleak, especially when it gets to the vampire twins arc, but it all has a reason and purpose. I'm glad the episode after the vampire twins arc was a funny one because my god, that arc was really dark. Episodes 16-18 were some of the funniest and fun.I love that scene between Roc and Revy at the market when they get into a heated argument. A lot of raw human emotions going on there. The characters in this show are so well written and fleshed out that you'd think they actually exist in real life. Along with this, the character development among certain characters is impeccable. Dude, and the way they introduce Roberta, was insane! Such an awesome character. That was funny how Roc made a Terminator reference when he was talking about Roberta right as I was thinking about how Roberta was a killing machine. That's really clever and well placed dialogue right there. I laughed so hard at the literal Terminator 2 reference when Roberta starts running like T-1000 towards the car and then hooks herself to it. This show is just too good. I love the relationship between Eda and Revy. They're like sisters to one another. And my god, I was not expecting Eda to have such a bangin' body. Seeing an unhinged animalistic Roberta was terrifying, and quite hot to be honest lol. But seeing her completely lose her mind and not know reality from imaginary was really sad. There was no going back for her from that point on. When that ending came, I couldn't help but feel sad. Knowing that it was the end of the show and that I wasn't going to be able to see Roc and Revy and everyone else anymore actually made me pretty sentimental. But I do have to say, they couldn't have ended the anime more perfectly.I love the outfit that Revy wears when she goes to Japan with Roc. It's cute but also fits her personality. Revy is hands down one of the best written, most interesting and complex female characters I've ever seen in an anime. And also one of the hottest. It's like with each passing episode we learn more and more about her. Unraveling a piece of her past and discovering who she really is and why she is the way she is. I love how she carjacks a purple VW hatchback and then proceeds to drive both Roc and Genji like a manic through the streets with punk music blasting in the car. You just can't beat that, very memorable. Genji's awesome as well. Dude killed I don't even know how many guys using only his sword, no guns. Pretty awesome. The talk between Roc and Yukio in the locker room was quite impactful. She pretty much exposed Roc for who he really is and how he was as a person. The way she envied how Roc lived a free life while she was tied down to her responsibilities as being head of the clan. What makes the relationship between Roc and Yukio so tragic is that Yukio started out just like Roc, both were in the twilight sort of speak and this is why they got along so well at first. But then Yukio had to make a choice that changed her life and in turn, it turned her towards the darkness. Yukio was a direct reflection of Roc and what could happen to him if he decided to lie to himself and choose the wrong path. It was definitely sad and upsetting to see Yukio take her life like that. It reminds me how dark and unforgiving the world can be.My only complaint about this anime is that the art style with certain characters doesn't feel that original. Some of the character faces and models remind me a lot of 90's anime, like Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, which is kind of meh to me. It's like in some areas with certain characters they really put a lot of thought and fleshed them out while others are kind of bland and uninspired. It might just be a creative decision, but it would've been nice to see a more creative art style across the whole board. Other than that, there's really no other complaints. There's a couple episodes like around 11 & 12 with the revolutionary fighters that I didn't really care about, but it's nothing that detracts from the entire show. It's a pretty edgy show, which will definitely turn off and offend some people, but it's not enough to not watch and enjoy it. It was made during a different time and you have to remember that the characters in this show aren't necessarily good people, I mean everyone's criminals after all.To say that this anime was amazing is an understatement. This anime was so much fun to watch and I consider it one of my favorites. With all the style, cursing, dark humor and violence you would swear it was an anime made by Quentin Tarantino. And that is a good thing. Unexpectedly philosophical and existential, this anime has ways of going deep within the psyche in order to ask complex and profound questions about humanity. I think what surprised me the most was how all these characters are not necessarily good people, they're either criminals or killers, and yet they've been written in such a way where you care about them because they've been given so much humanity, personality, backstory and emotions. They're relatable, which is something I feel like a lot of anime either neglect or don't understand how to do. If you wanna reel in the audience and invest people in your story, you've gotta make your characters relatable. This anime is also the best at writing strong female characters. Don't stay trapped within the twilight, definitely check out this anime.",
        "We start with Rock who is a white collar from Tokyo, eventually he ends up being taken as a hostage by the smuggling company \"Lagoon\", meeting with Revy (the co-protagonist).Althogh Rebecca (Revy) is advertised as main protagonist (Shonen?), don't be fooled, the real protagonist is Rock and especially the twisting of his mind / character by the passing of the months and months spent in roanapur with the Lagoon team.He probably get negatively affected by Revy, an maybe fragile due to the stress situation he was suffering back working in Tokio.The character are very well assorted, however, please keep in mind this series is not suitable for minors.But the more you get into the series the more the fighting scenes start to look like US 80's action movie scene (not realistic), this is in my opinion the biggest issue, and keep in mind here I consider only the series and not the OAV (which is even worse on this respect).Finally, I can't forget Shenhua, she is awesome, ok maybe not fully realistic, maybe also some kind of fan service, but in the EN dub versions when she speaks... she drive nuts, especially when arguing with Revy...",
        "The show was well done and showed characters with some personality, its just sad it ended when there was potential for more",
        "Black Lagoon is insane fun, making the standard anime tropes work in unexpected ways.The setting is not a Japanese school, future dystopian Japan, or a fantasy pseudo-Europe, with far fewer cultural barriers for non-Japanese viewers like myself.The protagonist is a Japanese \"salary man\" (not a \"businessman\" like the dubbing keeps insisting for some reason), working with modern-day pirates in a corrupt Thai city, and coupled with an archetypal shrieking, hyper-violent girl.Many parts of Black Lagoon are impressive: the world-building, the characters, the humour, but most of all, the attention to detail. While the characters are a bit over the top, their motivations still make sense. Blending a foreign setting with the standard anime tropes works really well: subservient maids with machine guns, murderous kids, etc. The concept of a quiet and reasonable person working his way up in a gangster paradise is also beautifully executed. With most movies reducing foreign characters to stereotypes or props in the plot, Black Lagoon's authors did an impressive amount of research. (That said, the Japanese characters, even those with little screen time, are much more fleshed-out.)The series starts a bit slowly, setting the stage, and kicks into high gear with the Roberta arc. The yakuza plot, however, is where Black Lagoon becomes more introspective and slows down to peek into the minds of Rock, Revy, and Balalaika. The last chapters are real masterpieces.Arigatou gozaimasu, Rei Hiroe!",
        "Black Lagoon is one of those action-packed Animes where the blood flows thick and red, the guns and explosions are loud and when somebody dies...they die hard!!!Along the same lines as \"Cowboy Bebop\" but more grounded in reality than space, Black Lagoon's frequent pop-culture references help keep the show current and believable in a \"this could be happening somewhere\" kind of way!For those of you who enjoy a good story/ plot, the story definitely is there and really is not all that complicated to follow. However, this show is definitely more about the action scenes as they are fast, hard and over-the-top which is great for any action-adrenaline junkie!The story in a way is just a series of events which links together a whole lot of action scenes but it is the way it is all done which truly makes this anime show brilliant.The characters are another great point to the show as it really delves into peoples relationships with each other and why it is that they act the way the do or have such a dark view of the world. The interesting thing is that there really is no \"good guys\" in Black Lagoon. The good guys are in a way just as bad as the bad guys yet still manage to gain sympathy and laughs from the viewer.Which leads to another great thing about the show, the humour! Brilliant...though very dark, it is still very funny!!!Each season is short (12 episodes) but each episode runs so well into the next that it is hard not to watch another one straight after just to see what happens next. Same can be said about season 2 as it pretty much just continues right from where season one left off. I don't know the exact details but I'm sure the show must have just been one season that was split into 2 possible for DVD release purposes but I'm not 100% sure of that fact.I will say that season 2 does take the action to a whole 'nother level and it is a lot more brutal than in the first season. There is also more bad language and adult/sexual themes in season 2 which is great but maybe not for all, especially people who found the first season a little bit much.All up a great action series for fans of Anime or just action in general.I hear rumours of a third season on the horizon which I hope is true as I'll be happy to watch another 12 episodes (or more) of Black Lagoon just to get another healthy does of non-stop action, guns, babes and bullets!!!\"Don't bother me, the door is locked!\"Luke: 11 (apparently).",
        "Originally I've found this anime years ago but i never gave it a chance, i saw a half naked girl for the cover and figured it was gonna be some stupid anime with lots of ass and boobs with no decent story line or plot. But this year i saw it went on toonami and gave it a chance, best thing i could of done! This show has so much action, violence, and action!! with the very subtlest of romance(it does have boobs n ass but theirs a lot more to it). If you like real life guns that look exactly like they were thrown into your TV screen from your lap then this could be something you'd like. To the contrary to the normal anime or TV series where the hero beats the villain and everything is all good and happy, then this will be a nice change for you. I don't want to spoil anything for but if you like things like the mafia, gangs, and money then this is a must. The main characters just pull you in and leave you wanting more, unlike most series where the back story of every character is just thrown at you one episode after another, Black Lagoon slowly gives you bits and pieces of everyone back story's leaving you to just wonder more and more in suspense!Overall point: If you like action, guns, money, and violence, and detailed characters that make you learn to love there twisted ways, then this anime is definitely worth a watch! I enjoyed it very much.",
        "I enjoy this even as an adult, infinitely better than other anime and most films nowadays & TV even literature if we're going to cross compare. Good stuff. special & Unique",
        "The truth is that I started watching Black Lagoon just because Revy looks identical to Misato (from evangelion) and I thought it was just going to be a pirate anime, I don't know why.One of the strong points of the series is to make the stories in arcs of only a couple of episodes, that may make you believe that the stories and the characters are stuck only there, but this is not the case. In fact, another point that I liked a lot is the capacity that anime has little by little to join the threads of the different stories.As for the characters, they are all very characteristic, special and extravagant if you will. Not only in its design, the fact that we pass from a yakuza to some killer brothers makes it fascinating.My grade is an 8 because it is an anime that, although I am not obsessed with finishing it, it kept me from continuing and that is valued.HONORABLE MENTION: Roberta I love you.",

    "Dragon Ball Z": [
        "This was a childhood favourite of mine. Even as a child I found it much better than Pokemon and Beyblade, both of which I found predictable and repetitive, and I still do. Along with Avatar:The Last Airbender, Dragonball Z is one of the most creative, coolest and most epic cartoon series I have had the fortune to see.The animation is really quite impressive, and doesn't show its age. The backgrounds have an ethereal quality to them, the colours are eye-popping with unique shades to them and the character designs are impressive too. Also the visual effects are very, very good and enhance rather than distract, and there is some great-looking animation in the well choreographed fight sequences.The music is another strong asset. Not just the iconic theme tune, but the background music fits perfectly. The stories have outstanding ideas and mature themes and any conflict is done in a resourceful and compelling way. The writing is also excellent and induces thought, the characters are immensely likable with great personalities and the voice acting fits the characters perfectly.To cut a long story short, this series is really quite wonderful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
        "I tried watching this again years after it came out. it is basically unwatchable from all the filler (1 viewing)",
        "I love DB however there is a reason why I don't rewatch it.The fights, saga and story is too long. It lasts over 200 episodes to finish off a saga and fight.Back as a child YTV use to replay DBZ all the time. That means I had to watch 200 episodes for 5 years again and again just to see who wins in the frieza fight.The only way I knew was when I was grown and searched it on YouTube.The show is fine for what it is. Its the long-drawn-out fights.DB on a general whole is not rewatchable because it's a time waster show. Not even being locked down will make me sit through 200 pointless epsiodes of a fight.",
        "When it comes to the 2-D animation effects of 1996's \"Dragon Ball GT\" - I, for one, certainly don't have any real complaints to beef about there. Nope. Visually speaking - This TV program delivered some really satisfactory anime, for the most part.But - On the other hand - When it came down to the irritating, pipsqueak characters who (unfortunately) dominated a good part of Dragon Ball GT's story-lines - That, of course, was another matter. Indeed.Man-o-man - These snivelling, irksome, little rugrats continually grated on my nerves, big-time.By the overall immaturity and incessant whining and bickering that took place amongst these juvenile brats, it became plainly obvious (from my perspective) that Dragon Ball GT was, indeed, geared to an audience-mentality so infantile that I just couldn't relate to it on any level, whatsoever.And, so - (Because of this total annoyance) - I just gave up on watching Dragon Ball GT after viewing only 4 of its episodes.",
        "''Dragon Ball Z'' is the story of Son Goku already an adult. Piccolo is a friend, among other fighters that in Goku's childhood were enemies, and in the first episodes Goku shows Gohan to them. In the beginning, Gohan looks to be a weak kid, without any kind of powers : but when Goku needs to fight abroad the Earth, Gohan is going to be trained by Piccolo. (Who eventually will have an affection for the boy) Dragon Ball Z is the long-running sequel to the anime Dragon Ball. The series is a close adaptation of the second and longer then ''Dragon Ball''. Goku, with his companions, needs to defend the Earth and many other planets against various villains, much more powerful then the first Dragon Ball.We have new characters, like Vegeta and much more action. Gohan will be older in the series too, and Chichi and Goku are going to have another son, Goten.In my opinion this is the best version of the series.",
        "\"Dragonball Z\" wasn't the first anime I got introduced to. But is the first series that made an impact on me. I never could have dreamed that a cartoon with (what seemed like) so many goofy characters could move me so much. The first thing that I noticed that was so different from other shows were the epic battles. It took several episodes for a battle to finish. When I saw the battle between Goku and Frieza on Cartoon Network I got hooked immediately. At that time there wasn't a show that was as exciting as \"Dragonball Z\". This was a show that had great action,a lot of comedy and even drama. \"Dragonball Z was full of surprises and you didn't know what to expect. OK,after a few seasons the story may got predictable but it still had the best action ever seen in a cartoon. But the most important thing as should be in every show were the characters. Even the most clumsy and useless characters managed to do something that made you care for them. I have re watched some episodes and they still are very effective and exciting. \"Dragonball Z\" is here to stay forever,a true classic!",
        "Dragonball Z is a great anime series. Unlike a lot of that anime garbage, Dragonball Z has story and cutting edge action. It has everything a good show needs. Good writing, comedy, drama, adventure, suspense and lots of action. There are also a lot of interesting characters. Dragonball Z is worth watching.",
        "My introduction to \"Dragon Ball Z\" was similar to most people who grew up in the 90's. It was on Toonami, it looked strange at first, but it hooked me with the story, characters, music and just being the most hype thing ever. Soon I started recording episode of the show on VHS. I had the VHS set of SLP so I could fit about 18 episodes on one VHS tape. It began with the \"Ocean Dub\" then evolved to the \"Funimation Dub\" we know today. I watched this show religiously. And with recording it, I would watch each episode a second time once my brother got back from gymnastics. Then I would watch the episode a third time with my friend from school.When I say in the title that this show is the \"most influential\" I mean it in two ways. First is the impact it had on a worldwide scale. Anime finally got its foothold in the American market. It had tried previously as far back as Astro Boy, stuff like Speed Racer and the great Miyazaki films. But those were all seen as niche markets that didn't show much promise. Dragon Ball Z changed that. Teamed up with Cartoon Network's prime time Toonami block, those commercials and TV Spots are some of the coolest advertisements you're going to see. Look back at the most searched things on Yahoo through 1998-2004 and you'll find that Dragon Ball Z was always in the top 10. Dragon Ball Z started an anime revolution that is still being felt to this day. It effected TV, movies and even video games. Even film makers like the Wachowski's and Michael B. Jordan can credit their inspiration back to this show.The second way this show is the most influential, is on a personal level. In my life I have sunk more hours into watching this show than any other. I have seen 3 different English dubs of show. Watched all the various movies and other TV shows that come with it. I have played most of the video games and read the manga. Through their focus on fighting and training, it motivated me to lose weight and get into shape. The way the characters are able to rise up through any challenges that come their way motivated me to do hard things.OK, I have rambled. I bring all this up to demonstrate the impact the show has made both worldwide and personally. It is impossible for me to do a completely objective review of the show. Outside of its impact, how is the show itself? Really really good. One of the best. Admittedly there are some animation errors, recycled animation, pace breaking filler, and the Buu Saga, (the last 6 seasons) really drags on. But, I don't care. To me, this show is a 10 out of 10, everything I could have wished for.",
        "'Dragon Ball Z' isn't much different from 'Dragon Ball'. It continues the success of the first one by making use of the same basic formula: martial arts, Japanese stuff and very violent battles between the good and the bad. With the exception of some new characters, most characters are the same from the previous version of this anime TV show.Basically what I said about 'Dragon Ball' can be applied to this one, so there's not much to add. However, 'Dragon Ball Z' is extremely violent (even more so than the original) and it's not unusual to see the characters bleeding, severely injured from the battles's violence. And each new villain is more dangerous and powerful than the previous one, leading to increasingly aggressive battles. Each new ones seems to be invincible. True, the good guys always win, but that's always after long-lasting wars until they have no more strength.Yet, despite all the violence contained, this and the previous version also have their moments of comedy and peace of mind.I remember when 'Dragon Ball Z' came out to replace the older version. I never understood the reason of the 'Z' in its title. And I remember very well singing its theme song many times, which I thought was cool.Anyway, this anime show can become very addictive. For those who are parents, I advice you to be careful with the interpretation your kids make out of it and with the influence it may have on them. To the kids I also let an advice about the things they see in this: do not try this at home!",
        "Amongst most rubbish I was forced to watch as back in my childhood days, this stands out as an instant classic. I started watching it around the Ginyu saga when I was probably younger than seven or eight, and as a child I looked forward eagerly to each episode like no other show before and few since. \"Next time on Dragonball Z\u0085\", it was great. As a kid, it seemed quite different from the kind of action the USA was putting out, and the fights were unbelievable. However, some have lambasted it as over-lengthy, bad-dubbing and a terrible English score.My, my shame, on all of you, criticizing your own childhood. But as it goes, I will enlighten those critics. For starters, over lengthy? It was simply a very, very, long tale of epic proportions told in small and detailed bits. If you've watched it and paid attention to the character's reactions to things, it will dawn you this is on the level of a Greek tragedy. Some of the filler was unnecessary but a lot of it was either funny or added to the fights. Overall if you hate filler, \"Dragonball Z Kai\" is now available for viewing. Bad dubbing? Sean Schemmel,, Christopher Sabat, Eric Vale, if you hated the dubbing it was probably due to some of the cheesy lines they incorporated. However, as you may or may not know the original Japanese cut is free of this. What exactly did you expect, seeing as it was being broad casted on prime time, and not late night animes like you would often see on \"Adult Swim\". Granted, it's somewhat better, but if that's what you want just purchase the season box sets, which contain several language and audio options, plus revised dialog. Bad score, please! The score by Faulconer is fresh, something new and it sharpens the action to an irresistible point. Once more, if you don't like it, the season box sets can let you enjoy the also exhilarating Japanese score in 5.1 surround sound, awesome! Aside from those ludicrous claims, I believe DBZ holds together as a timeless show with many themes. Themes of pride, loyalty, courage and endurance. The characters develop continuously from start to finish, the most noteworthy of them being Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo and (Future) Trunks. While kids will find it hard not to watch, there's a fair level of violence and even disturbing character moments. The villains were never boring and always so varied from one another. Frieza with his cold and calculating persona, Cell with his thirst for greater challenges and power, and Buu in all his insanity. The fights are of course were always amazing, brutal and here and there even funny. Akira Toriyama has created a masterpiece that will be passed on for generations.The artwork is stunning despite the age. Owning all the seasons as I do, makes you realize that a very select few episodes had a somewhat less standard look to them, but these are scattered about and one could hardly notice. Anyways, far from a brainless smack down, DBZ takes you on a adventurous adrenaline fueled thrill ride and yet deliverers emotionally and comically as well. If you're a true fan make sure to get the seasons and pass this on to your siblings or children, as I have.",
        "Dragon Ball Z was the first anime I ever watched, setting the standard for what anime is like and what it should be. I've gone on and watched more anime since, and that standard has long since been surpassed. Nevertheless, Dragon Ball Z will always hold a special place in my heart.Despite this, Dragon Ball Z is still far from great. The length is my biggest issue. Maybe its just me, but I like to be done a series in twenty episodes. Of course, I make plenty of exceptions, but that's my preference. At the time, I thought all anime was just one hundred plus episodes and that I just had to deal with it. Either way, Dragon Ball Z is just too long. The fights drag on and never change, and by the end of an episode I always feel like nothing has been accomplished (and this happens a lot). I was rarely excited by the fights because of this, and that really took away from the enjoyment of watching them. The show's story isn't great either. Sure, this is a show about fighting, but it never changes. Apparently every evil alien in the universe has the same life goal in mind. The show starts to get really stale by the second story arc. The characters for the most part are done well enough. The only major growth seems to be in physical strength, but occasionally we get a character like Vegeta who shows incredible development through all nine seasons, making him the real star of the show. Still, his character struggled in terms of life goals, considering it never changed. Overall Dragon Ball Z is a classic example of a really, really long anime. In the end, I wouldn't say it was worth it. I wouldn't suggest you watch this show (unless you've already started it/watched it). It's not that it's bad or anything, it's just not worth it in the end. Sure, Vegeta's journey throughout the show is great, but in the grand scheme of things, it wasn't worth it. Despite my rating, I wouldn't recommend Dragon Ball Z. But if you want to watch it still, then go right ahead. It's better then plenty of other shows that I've seen, but easily worse then a lot of others. If you loved it, then I can respect that, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.",
        "The sound is fine. If you're watching the show in English FUNimation has given the show a brand new 5.1 surround sound mix, which sounds excellent on a surround sound system. If you're like me though, and prefer to watch the show in it's original Japanese language track, you'll find the same mono track that was presented on all the other single disk releases of the show. With (what surely sounds like) a fatal flaw when it comes to the viewing of the show, many of you may be wondering why you'd want to bother with the show at all. Well, two things: Picture and price. Yes, the display of the show may be the biggest problem for this show, but the restoration is also one of the brightest things about the DVD. While not perfect, \"Dragon Ball Z\" has never looked this good before on DVD. The colors are mostly perfect, and the tone is very consistent, with only some grain to be found in certain spots. Regardless what you think of the widescreen presentation, the look of the picture is excellent.Then there's the fact that this DVD set retails for $50 and contains the first 39 episodes. I remember spending $20 on a \"Dragon Ball Z\" DVD with three episodes on it. If you bought the single disk releases on sale for $16 each (and this is being generous, as most single disk \"Dragon Ball Z\" DVD's will cost you $20 easily), then you'd spend around $250 by the time you got up to episode 39. Considering you can get \"Dragon Ball Z: Season One\" on sale for $30-$35 at most places, this is the cheapest \"Dragon Ball Z\" has ever been on DVD. At this rate, $250 will get you the whole show. All 291 episodes for what you would originally pay for the privilege to own 39 episodes. Despite the issues with the widescreen, it's hard to argue when the savings are that huge. Whether or not the widescreen issue is enough to scare you away from this DVD is entirely up to you.Re-watching the show again after I hadn't seen it for several years has made me see it in an entirely different light. It no longer seems to be the greatest action show I remember it to be. Some of the fights are rather silly looking, there are stretches of time that contain way too much filler, and several episodes early on in the show seem to wasting time while they are waiting for the story to come around. That said, when the show is good it's very good. Character development in these early episodes is excellent, there are many heartbreaking moments, and to actually go back to when Goku wasn't a Super Saiyan is a revelation as it shows me that it was more interesting to see these characters grow stronger then it was to watch them...well, BE stronger! It's not a perfect show, but a good portion of the episodes on this set do hold up quite well, and there's a reason we'll still be watching \"Dragon Ball Z\" several years from now. . For now though, I think I can live with these sets. On that note though, why is Vegeta on the cover for Season One while Goku gets banished to being on the cover of Season Two?",
        "A great series indeed with compelling characters and arcs it's so enthralling but isn't free from issue either certain drawbacks related to power and originality etc. Regardless the development of character over the whole dragon ball series is impressive and done to such a great degree",
        "Is it true? Is this stupid show finally ending? I heard that it was going to end sometime this year since another follow up would start (Dragonball GT which I hear really sucks) this fall on CN. What a relief.Anyways, this show to me sucks for several reasons: First off the fighting sequences. It takes like 30 episodes for a single fight to start, and end. How in the blue hell can they make a fight last 30 episodes long like that? Christ Lupin the 3rd could steal 30 exotic treasures(as well as flirting on his Fuji-Cakes in between) in 30 episodes while this takes 30 episodes for ONE FIGHT!Second, the whole hair thing. Are Goku and company Punk rock fans, or do they love having bedhead? The hair thing is so ANNOYING! Do they have hair combs on the planet they live on? Probably not.Third, and final thing is again the fighting. It's the same cliched fighting: Punch, kick, punch, kick, punch, or Kick, punch, kick, punch, kick with their super powers thrown in for flavor. It's the same all the darn time!!!Thank god this show is over, because now me, and many other DBZ haters won't have to gripe about it anymore....By the way, enjoy your DragonBall GT folks, and watch it destroy the franchise. BWAAHAAHAAAHAAA!!!!",
        "Just like Pokemon, this show has made a lot of money on merchandising such as trading cards, video games, manga, etc. But don't focus your attention on that. There has been many people who have heard of this show. Yes, Cartoon Network is one of the largest companies to broadcast animated cartoons for children and adults (Adult Swim). So, there is a large chance you can ask a kid what they think of Dragon Ball Z.Dragon Ball Z is full of the exciting adventures of Goku, Gohan, and more characters you will discover on the way! There are so many sagas of this exciting show. Freeza, Cell, Majin Buu, and more. I will never forget them.Dragon Ball Z continues off from Dragon Ball, and I have to say, this is much better. Much better than Dragon Ball GT. It's more violent. Although, you have to look pass the censoring they did for children and think of what they should have kept and just forget about children, and air it on Adult Swim. That's what they should have done. Also, Dragon Ball seems too much for children. Not fun.",
        "First time that I watch a Japanese Anime.Dragon Ball Z is a Japanese martial arts / action / adventure series, which in the first season deals with Son Goku / Son Gohan's roots and a danger lurking above the ground.It quickly dawns on you that there is an extensive and extensive lore in the series, which is actually very exciting to dive into. However, the season is really, really really long, and with countless training sessions and filler episodes, the season could easily be drastically cut to the bone. , without damaging the series.There are quite insane story choices along the way, although not a single character is safe, especially at the end of the season there is a kind of overriding security around our very central heroes. This slightly spoils the otherwise intense atmosphere. Moreover, it is very clear that the series was made long before metoo, which is a bit funny.Finally, Dragon Ball Z is one of the great childhood memories, so I really hope the series holds water going forward.Hopes for season 2\nMore elaborate world buildingA shorter seasonMore heady fights",
        "More use of color games (such as their flying rays, Namek's sky)\nFrieza is the dirtiest villain in the series so far-Velocrated match between Zarbon and Vegeta\nBrutal battle against Ginyu ForceFrieza is starting to get more and more flat with his squiky voice and broadcastGinyu Force is not at all as scary as rumors suggest.Vegetas replicas suck here late in the seasonThankfully not as much filled as in the first season. The world is evolving, but there is still far too much Bulma.From rating 8 to 7.",
        "I'll start off by admitting that I'm not the biggest fan of anime (or at least, English-dubbed anime).  Anyway, I'll move on to my review -   My younger brother used to love this show when he was much younger (he's 12, I'm 13), so I (naturally) sat through some episodes.  Well . ..   THEY SUCKED!   I'll give fans of this show the benefit of the doubt - I've never seen the undubbed Japanese version, so THAT might be good.  The American version is, as I said, pathetic.  The scenes with Trunks or whoever are impossible to tell what the hell the point is or what's going on.  (Or maybe it's filler.)  Like other dubbed anime dialogue, the writing WREAKS and is horrible.  I'll comment on \"pop culture\" references in American-dubbed anime in an upcoming review of \"Pokemon\", because I've watched almost all of the episodes of that show.     Recently, I sat down and watched an episode on my own, to be fair.  It wasn't any better.   To be fair, this show is better than most other anime garbage (that I've seen) - \"Sailor Moon\", \"Pokemon\", \"Monster Rancher\", et al - that I've seen. But is that really a complement?   Four stars because it's not the worst out there.",
        "One of the first well known animes, DBZ took a step in Japanese animation that no one has ever seen before. Although before this there was Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z is not only better known, but a lot more praised. When I think of anime, the first thing I think of is this awesome show. Action packed and epic as crap, this show put an icon on the Japanese animation industry.The story follows a grown up Goku, (main character of Dragon Ball where he was a kid, for those not familiar) as he and his friends battle an onslaught of enemies all around the universe looking to take over the world. Goku and his friends will protect the world from devastation with an iron fist, defending all that is good.The first show, Dragon Ball, was Goku as a kid battling the foes of Earth. Now, it's any made up planet name you can think of. This show probably has it. So many awesome characters in this show, as well as awesome villains. Animation and colors are all amazing, the action is sick nasty, and the adventure is irresistible. Goku runs into all kinds of different races, beings, and enemies he never thought existed.The show is 291 episodes long, and if that's not enough for you, 13 specials (or movies) for your entertainment as well. Iv'e seen all of the English dubbed and Japanese subbed. I can honestly say I prefer the Japanese subbed better. Better voices, better dialogue, and just all around sounds better. Dubbed is still pretty good, but i'd stick with subbed.This show pretty much made anime popular. The only other anime I can think of in the 1980s was Dragon Ball, also worth checking out. So this show pretty much invented the popularity in anime. Dragon Ball Z is everywhere you see. Even when you don't know it. It's referenced so much, and is every kid's favorite thing to watch, well mine anyway.If you are going to watch it, I recommend watching Dragon Ball first, so you can follow the story chronologically. Dragon Ball starts with Goku as a kid, him meeting Bulma, all the way to until he's a teenager. Then five years later, it jumps into Dragon Ball Z, with a grown up Goku. By the end of DBZ, it is Goku as a grandpa. If you're really interested, then go ahead and watch Dragon Ball GT, the show after DBZ. It's not as good as the other two, but if you're curious enough, or a hardcore fan like me, then go ahead. I watched it, and it's pretty much worth checking out.If you're looking for a good anime to watch, look no further. This show will blow your mind to no end. It's fast, action packed, well made, creative, and adventurous as crap. It truly is an icon in its own mind, and anybody else with half a mind would say so as well. Without a doubt the #1 best anime show in the world! 10/10",
        "I have been watching DragonBall Z, for 15 years since 1999. I own some of the Season DVDs you can buy online or sometimes find in places like Walmart. Dragon Ball Z is timeless, I mean it's interesting to think how the episodes you watched aired in the USA in the late '90s early 2000s, and they even aired earlier in Japan in the '80s and '90s. Watching this show years later, it does not look old or lose it's appeal, some of the graphics from the older episodes, mostly DragonBall look a little old. DragonBall Z is the version they started out with in the USA before DragonBall thinking DragonBall Z would get more viewers. It used to be on Cartoon Network on Toonami. They later would have DragonBall be part of Toonami to show the origin of the story. Then, they'd later do DragonBall GT, but DragonBall GT is non- cannon and written by somebody else. Most of us don't like GT as much. By all means, DragonBall Z has been a huge success. I've read interviews from the guy who wrote the series on the Manga, Akira Toriyama. He did not anticipate the series going on for so long. From what I read, Toriyama did not think much about writing after the first Saga Emperor Pilaf when he started the series. He would later think of ending the series after the Frieza and Cell Sagas. But, the success of the series had him continue writing it and coming up with new awesome story lines. Obviously, the series was awesome enough for him to continue writing it. Though some of the things he wrote did not seem well thought out of and he was probably trying to hurry up the series. For example, most of us do not like the series finale of DragonBall Z. There were also some things Toriyama obviously either forgot or stopped caring about from older episodes to later episodes. I personally am amazed at the success of DragonBall Z. People still talk about that show regularly even when it no longer is airing. I've worked at Amazon and some of the most popular franchise I saw on the shelves would be from DragonBall Z, mostly DVDs. You can also see so many clips from the show on YouTube and so many searches on Google for DragonBall Z showing it's a living legend. On YouTube if you want to hear about people who are fans of the series and have thought well of questions we have of the series and how to answer them you can go to Blackenfist and Qaamans Land. You can also Google Search any episode throughout the entire series, you could do a search on any attack, any character even like a background character from one episode. You can basically search like any noun that is from the DragonBall Z World and your top results will most likely be DragonBall Wiki where you can get a full in depth view on your search for what is known about it. So, I've talked about the success of DragonBall Z, I'll now talk about what makes it a good TV show. Well, it has a really good story line you're likely to get into if it interests you, and like a Soap Opera although this show isn't a Soap Opera, the story line is continuous where each episode continues where the last one left off, and the episodes frequently end at an exciting part where we will want to see what happens next. The show by all means is an empowering show, when I watch it I'll feel motivated to push myself harder as you see characters throughout the series training and always getting stronger. Sometimes it even shows real workouts we could be doing. So, the fact that we see characters that like to work out and continue to push themselves hard is motivational. The show has awesome fighting, which is one of the main reasons for the popularity of the show, the action. But, I don't see how you could not see the action in certain episodes and not think of it as epic. The characters in that show can also be role models, mostly Goku as he is the main character throughout the series. Goku is always cheerful and friendly. Goku has a mind set where he does not give up and can always think of a way to win the toughest fights. Well, thanks for reading. It's nice to write a review on a TV show I've been a fan of for so long and that never gets old.",
        "This is the best Anime ever. I love this as much as the old Pok\u00e9mon show. Goku is my favorite character in this and Gohan was at his best when he fought against Cell in the Cell Games saga. It also has a great story to it. I mean Goku is like the anime version of Superman. He crash lands on Earth as a baby from Planet Vegeta, gets his memory jumbled up by falling into a gorge and hitting his head on a rock and becomes good instead of evil like the other Saiyans were. Goku is one of the best fictional heroes ever and is totally awesome even after he dies twice. Vegeta is an awesome character too. Also when I saw the censored version of this as a kid I never realized that Master Roshi was really an old pervert. Looking at that now is funny. lol. I also found it funny and awesome when Super Saiyan Goku slaps Frieza on planet Namek when it was about to explode. This show is also the best that Toonami has to offer and it's a good thing that Toonami is back on Adult Swim and showing the Kai version of this. Also the best moment of Goku using the Spirit Bomb is when he uses it on Majin Buu. This is a great anime here. Enough said.",
        "Man, Dragon Ball (of what I call it, \"Dragon Bore\") series is such a boring and one of the most overrated anime series ever (besides Sailor Moon, Pokemon and Evangellion).From very ugly animation and character designs, to nonsensical plots that are about as deep and involving as a World Wide Wrestling match, Dragon has it. Seems like nothing gets accomplished in this show. All it is basically, is one bing long drawn out anime wrestling match. If you want a GOOD mythological based Anime, watch \"The Storm Riders\" anime series or the live action movie version too. I bet Wind and Frost could pound every character on this show.",
        "A dub worse than Lupin the 3rd, the Yu Yu Hakusho movie, and The Slayers put together.Dragonball Z rules.  FUNimation does not.  While DBZ originally had the characters acting mature, even in the face of the end of the world, FUNimation decided to take something great, and turn it into a show aimed for two year olds!  The characters now speak out lines that only braindead kids that are one year old would possibly laugh at.  Goku is a big change, the battle-ready warrior is now a typical comic book superhero, compltete with lame one note wise cracks!  AAAARRRRRRAAAAGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  Also, they took the wonderful music out from the original Japanese version, and replaced it with horrible synthesized tunes!  They even change major story plot points, not caring what the viewers will think.  A lot of people claim to hate Dragonball Z, but you know what?  I think that those same people have only seen the horrible U.S. version, and if I had to listen to preschool-type dialogue all the time, I'd probably hate it too.BOTTOM LINE:  FUNimation will pay.  At least the DVDs are out.",
        "Dragon Ball Z (1989-2003) is a popular anime that continues the adventures of Son Goku, in his adult life.The anime displays important life lessons and morals such as pride, kindness, and forgiveness. Even as an adult, you can learn a thing or 2 from this anime by witnessing Goku's personality and unusual moral choices. The show doesn't take itself too seriously thus it provides a lighthearted atmosphere and an easy-to-follow story that will certainly boost your mood and entertain you. The voice acting in the dubbed version is OUTSTANDING! There are a lot of powering up and screaming scenes in the show but Sean Schemmel and many others totally nailed it! Respect to you all!Now let's move to the negative parts of the show. There are plenty of problems when it comes to the story. Some \"rules\" or \"facts\" get introduced but they disappear randomly. One of the weirdest things is probably the \"Dragon Balls\" and the way they are used. Also, the show gets a bit repetitive after a while to the point where you can sort of figure out a pattern in the narrative making things a bit too predictable. The show also has a lot of drawn-out fights or scenes making it way longer than it should be.All in all, Dragon Ball Z (1989-2003) is an amusing show with a simple formula and likable characters. Maybe it's the nostalgia in me talking but I enjoyed the show!"

    "Serial Experiments Lain": [
        "Lain Iwakura is a fairly ordinary, if rather quiet, middle school girl whose life is about to change. After a girl from her school commits suicide pupils start receiving emails from her. Not being particularly interested in 'The Wired', their version of the internet, she doesn't immediately realise that she has been sent one too. She soon starts to take an interest and her father gets her a new computer; it isn't long before she has customised it. Soon things get rather strange; people claim that they have met another Lain in the Wired and two men are seen watching her house. Then the nature of reality starts to be doubted as events in the real world and the wired become hard for Lain to distinguish.I really enjoyed this series but feel it would benefit from viewing a second time as I was a bit confused, in a good way, at times. From the start there is a good sense of mystery; and that only increases as the series progresses. The series looks good with character designs that suit the darker tone of the show; Lain has a distinctly sorrowful look. The backgrounds are also impressive with the omnipresent power cables that remind us of The Wired. Given that this is almost twenty years old now and is effectively about an alternate version of the internet if feels surprisingly fresh while other early films about the internet often feel very dated. Overall I'd say this certainly won't be for everybody but I'd certainly recommend trying it if you are looking for something a little different.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "This anime series has been getting a lot of attention on the internet lately from fanboys, film buffs, and lay people alike. Judging from the first four episodes in the series, its fantastic reputation is wholly undeserved.\nBut let me stress how utterly beautiful and magnificent the artistry is of the drawings before I get into ripping it to shreds. I LOVE the style, to be sure. I haven't seen anything else like it. The drawing is the series' one saving grace. The direction is somewhat disappointing, though. First off, let me explain what direction is in animation, because that confuses a lot of people. Direction is the choice of things like camera angles, camera movement, use of slow motion, and mise-en-scene among other things. Of course, in animation, everything is drawn in order to emulate the cinematic devices used in live action film. Once in a while, the direction in Lain 1: Navi is impressive, but its devices are overused and end up growing repetitive. The internal rhythm of both the editing and story become extremely and annoyingly repetitive even in a single episode. To watch four back to back is nearing torture. Whoever at Pioneer decided to keep the opening and closing credits in all four episodes, instead of placing an opening credits sequence at the beginning of the DVD and a closing at the end, should have his or her head examined closely. They are long sequences in the first place, and when Pioneer claims that there is 96 or 100 or however many minutes on the DVD, make sure you realize that a good half hour of those are for these opening and closing sequences. The writing is the aspect which really destroys this series, or these four episodes, anyway. It strives to be really mysterious, so much so that eventually I didn't care any more. Mystery does not automatically equal intelligence (or entertainment, for that matter). Nothing went into the characters. What can I say about Lain? She's shy. That's all. By the end of the fourth episode, she has changed. She's slightly less shy. I'm sure someone will point her \"development\" out when they argue with me about it, so I'd like to establish the pettiness of her development. Her father? He likes computers. Her mother? Nothing. Her sister? Even less. Her friends? Nope. Her teacher? Charlie Brown's teacher had more personality, and she was just a distorted trumpet. And people can say, \"Wait until episode 8 and you'll know a lot more,\" all they want, because I'll just reply that any good animated series, or even a bad network sitcom, would have developed its characters much more thickly in one episode than does Lain in four.\nEvery ounce of the writer's/s' energy goes into making the film more mysterious. The series begins with a young girl killing herself, who then contacts her peers by email. A good concept; they should have stuck with it (well, they do stick with it, but they set it on the backburner for the rest of the series). Then there's a drug-like object that drives people insane. Then they start to hint that Lain and others are possessed. Then there're these guys with laser pointers over one of their eyeballs (stolen right from the French film City of Lost Children, although I don't personally condone stealing when it comes to filmmaking). Then there's a little girl who chases people around the city. All of this is direly mysterious stuff, but the authors didn't even seem to attempt to imbue a modicum of suspense into the film. There's even one clear reference to Hitchcock's The 39 Steps at the end of the fourth episode. Lain realizes that she's being watched in her room, which is on the upper floor of her family's house. The filmmakers here have learned not a thing from the Master of Suspense. Perhaps they saw the remake of The 39 Steps, since they, just as in the remake, cut from Lain in her room to a street-level shot of the laser-eye people. Hitchcock would have (and did) keep the point of view in Robert Donat's appartment. I'd also like to point out that Lain makes one of their eye-devices explode, which reminds everyone instantly of Akira. Boy, was I longing for the excitement and intelligence of Akira when I saw that!I seriously doubt I'll end up watching any more of this series, no matter how good I've heard that it gets later on. I literally thanked God when it was over. Not because it was terrible, but because it was, simply put, terribly boring.",
        "Serial Experiments Lain is the kind of show you either love or hate.I personally think it has many excellent qualities, such as a great atmosphere, an awesome soundtrack, interesting themes and a neat art-style.But yeah, it IS quite confusing, even after several rewatches. I don't necessarily think one needs to \"get\" this series to fully enjoy it (Seriously, who really \"gets\" Lain? I'm not even sure the creators themselves fully \"get\" it)I do admit this is a pretty unique series. The kind of show wouldn't be made these days, with worldwide fiction getting more safe and predictable.Late 90s /early 2000s anime was frankly way more daring, both visually and narratively speaking.To the negative reviewers entirely dismissing the series for being \"boring\", I just say people has varying tastes of what qualifies an \"entertaining\" series, and what bores me it's vapidness and generic stuff, two things Lain isn't.Any viewer expecting an action series, or conventional horror (with lots of gore, monsters and similar stuff) it's going to be bitterly disappointed.One would think that with the internet slowly taking over more and more aspects from our daily lives, there would be more appreciation for this series, but it seems the current generation is just as puzzled by Lain as my generation was.",
        "I thought this anime wasn't at all that great, yeah it was very sad a girl committed suicide because she felt like an outsider. However the story wasn't great at all for making it more interesting to watch. I think it was rather too fast and just bland in my opinon, even the character Lain just doesn't seem like the type of person who would bother even trying to solve the girls case. I mean having a complete blank character irritates you because you feel like telling them to wake up regardless if they are fictional or not!I don't care if this got positive reviews, I wasn't happy watching it!",
        "A week after Chisa committed suicide, her classmates begin to receive emails from her. Hearing rumors fly at school, a quiet withdrawn girl named Lain goes home that day, turns on her dusty Navi computer for the first time and has a conversation with the dead girl. Chisa's message reads that she killed herself because she didn't need her body anymore, and she now exists in The Wired. When Lain asks why someone would do something like that she gets a response: \"Because God is here\".Yeah this was definitely a ride to experience if you are into the Sci-Fi genre of anime like I am.I loved the animation/art style and the opening and ending.Do check this out if you haven't already.",
        "''Serial Experiments: Lain\" is so different, that I don't even know how to start writing about it. But one thing is sure: the fact that it is different is what makes it great! There are numerous references to Macintosh and Apple Computers and I love the voice that whispers in the beginning of every episode!(For people who loves technology like me, will be quite something to watch all the computers of this anime) Lain begins as a shy girl who doesn't care about computers and only have a kiddy navi, until became an expert with a gigantic computer that doesn't stop to grow in size and potency. There are many nice messages about this anime, like the power of alienation and how our lives are many times taken care by the digital world. In times like the ones we live, with so many technologies and the internet all set, this anime is very recommended! :)",
        "Something that could have only came when the internet was still mysterious in its working. But that doesn't change how philosophical and experimental it is, and beyond all focuses on emotions through an archetype that gets sidelined and turns into a unique experience. Even though it ends as a bit of a failed attempt to be Neon Genesis Evangelion this is still an amazing feat in visual media for executing something like this and not just dying in the minds of the brilliant people who made it.",
        "Boy, how I remember my first time wathing this.I had no idea what I had just watched (I'm still not entirely sure I do), but whatever it was, I loved it.",
        "This goes hands down directly under the title of \"most boring anime I've ever seen in my life\" (and I've seen a lot of them). And what's up with the reuse of animation frames after ONE EPISODE ONLY? I've never seen anything like that even in crappy shows like Golion King of Beasts. Boring, pretentious, stiffly animated. Reminiscent (how original!) of Matrix...yawhn. Avoid with no remorse whatsoever. Hands down the worst anime I've watched all this year, for now.",
        "This is a mind blowing experience and one of the best anime stories I have ever watched. More than any anime, this is what got me into anime back when this first came out in DVD form in the US, back in 1999. The story, which is a mystery, is compelling and mind blowing. Who is this second lain and for that matter who is lain. Who is the god like creature which haunts lain and why do lain's parents act so strange. The opening music is excellent as well and as you watch the episodes the music draws you further in. This is no mindless anime, you need to fully engage your brain and think. This is a must watch.",
        "The peak of anime as an art; an avant-garde expressionist tale that deals with technology, religion, postmodernism and existentialism, blurring the line between the real and the virtual via the world of the Wired (AKA the Internet), putting into question the several repercussions it has on our lives and also questioning our existence (particularly that of purpose and identity) and the validity of an omnipotent being.But Lain is a typical case of style that trumps substance. The anime is unique in its splendid audiovisual style, its excellent use of light and shadows, creating an atmosphere of surrealism, mixing traditional techniques with computer graphics. While the story is lackning substance and the serie never reaches any substantial excitment or climax.",
        "A smiling girl throws herself off the roof of a house in an entertainment district. Not only is this unusual, a week later girls in her class are getting emails from the deceased. Some believe the emails are fake, others believe they are real. Only Lain hardly notices anything about it...\n\"Serial Experiments: Lain\" is really heavy stuff and unfortunately I really didn't get along in a few moments.But I noticed that a really interesting idea and a story that almost predicts the future is being told here.The series has to get a higher rating just because of the works that were all inspired by it.",
        "Japanese television, specially animation, appears to allow for its artists much greater degree of artistic freedom compared to Western television. Such highly experimental TV series like Lain would never be made in the west which is a shame since it remains one of the best TV series I ever watched.The plot is very obtuse and doesn't make complete sense and the emotions of the characters are rather distant (which remembers me of the French new wave movies), which lends the series a very eerie and experimental tone. This series also scared the hell out of me. Remains a must watch for anybody interested in the artistic possibilities of animation and television series.",
        "I saw Neon Genesis Evangelion and was quite displeased with it. The characters weren't sympathetic enough and almost none of them were interesting except for Asuka, who is still exasperating. So, I checked out Lain, which was very similar to Evangelion but also couldn't get into it.The show is about a little unemotional 14-year-old girl named Lain. I was pleased with the autism of the character since I haven't seen any anime with autistic characters and I am also autistic. And the show begins well, but began to stumble during episode 3 and picked back up at 5, but then gone downhill towards the end at episode 8 and I decided to stop watching it at nine. It was very confusing and random.Lain's character change from a shy girl to an obsessive secretive girl was annoying. I also didn't care much for her love interest, Arisu.Some of the dialogue can be talky and the characters may seem interesting as well as the story at the start but none of them were very appealing as the show went on, which is hard to do once a show approaches its end. I liked the English dub better, the voice actors for Japanese were okay, the girl who voiced Lain was around 14 or 15 at the time. While the intro and the music is nice, the music for the ending theme didn't seem very fitting.The art had some problems here and there.I first heard of Lain at 15 and I was a little bit skeptical about it but decided to try it anyway since Evangelion had an interesting story and premise but didn't quite reach its potential. I was hoping it wouldn't be as bad as Evangelion but it is anyway, just like Evangelion, it stumbled during the last 6 episodes.",
        "Serial Experiments Lain is a classic anime series which takes place in a really cool Sci-Fi universe full of many twists and turns. If I could describe this show in one word it would be mysterious.",
        "Despite two full viewings and a book read, I'm not up to a full review of this most complex of all TV-series anime. Yet it pops up in more than one of my other reviews here. The perfect theme song and the artwork so unique that it's a substantial clue in itself cloy as effectively as the email that sets things going. Even more unsettling are Lain's compliant father, distant mother, and I-still-don't-know-what-epithet-to-give-her sister. Lain's a quiet entry in the Ozu/Morita/Yamada/Miike string of impossible-or-are-they families. Though it precedes Visitor Q, it reaches well beyond it and manages to do so, at least in any conventional sense, without offending.One might simultaneously summarize and mystify Lain like this: Lain receives email from a classmate who committed suicide; the missives, quite genuine, were posted after the death; it's not a ghost story.",
        "If you can get past 25% of this series being musical depictions of power lines, there is a fun mystery to be solved by the viewer. It was very slow to get started, but by the second half of the 13 episode series I was absolutely hooked. This is a show that DOES NOT spoon-feed you the answers.The discordant and almost schizophrenic themes that turned me off in the first few episodes quickly resolve into a purpose by mid season, so if you can stick it out, you will be rewarded with a very unique story.",
        "\"SE: Lain\" is a great anime series. It's not godly perfect or anything, but it gets up there...way up there. From the killer opening title sequence (with a great opening song, by the way) to the strange \"previews\" (they only consist of a girl talking and her body parts - I'm not kidding) for the next show, \"Lain\" certainly has a fairly unique style. But it goes beyond style and gets into substance.The story is simple at first and seems half-predictable in these post-\"Matrix\" times. After a classmate seemingly commits suicide, Lain gets e-mail from the dead girl. Apparently, her consciousness is still on the net...or is it? From then on, things get weird, complicated, and interesting.Splicing in elements of Matrix-style cyberpunk, X-Files conspiracy, and the David Lynch-esque surreal, \"Lain\" is, like the Wired world it portrays, a synthesis of disparate ideas and personas, all thrown into a blender for the viewer to interpret. The interpretation's the thing, and those looking for action or comedy may come away slightly disappointed. After 13 episodes, there will probably be more questions than answers, but isn't real life like that, anyway?",
        "This show is the peak of all film. Everything else will lack compared to this. This film is filled to the brim with complex questions about life presented in a audio-visually stunning way.It does not bounce around \"hard to talk about\" subject and nor does it present them immaturely. The show deals with psychological and philosophical themes. Everything is the show has a meaning and none of it is filler.Lain is a show where what you perceive it to be depending on your mood. or even state of mind can be totally different, Everyone takes their own subjective view on the show because it is filled to the brim with content that can only be viewed in a subjective manner.>this is the best show of all time\n>don't pass it up",
        "This show is about a girl called Lain and she connects to 'The Wired' with her computer. The Wired is a global communications network.Serial Experiments Lain is animated by Triangle Staff and is produced by Yasuyuki Ueda.The animation is great, although you could call some of it lazy but I think that it is great.The plot is great and complex. The series is very complex and interesting. The problems get resolved in the end.The characters are very interesting. Lain's relationship with her family, friends and everyone else are interesting and surprising as they don't always show their previous encounters. Her relationship with her family is weird and you can notice it is odd, early in the series. Her relationship with friends is good as they like her, especially Alice who she is closest too. The other characters are more mysterious and have a weird relationship with Lain.I prefer the Sub. The voice acting is great and it fits the characters. The Op and ending songs are Amazing and I love them.I recommend this anime to everyone.",
        "This is not a show that can be easily recommended. If you are someone who gladly watches documentaries, subtitles, etc., yes, you are one of those few people I could at least reluctantly point it to. :-).This series is very short, just 4 hours and 20 mins. Yet I felt that it was a lot longer. In comparison I recently watched 'Mysterious Girlfriend X' which is of the exact same duration and I felt that it was too short! The first 1 hr 20 mins is extremely slow. So if you were to start watching this show, you need to watch at least till the 5th episode to see whether you will like it. From the 5th episode the show slowly starts picking pace and the story starts to get shape and you slowly start getting pulled into it.Hope you have read the official story line.Beyond that: This show is very reminiscent of the Matrix. But without the excitement and the glamour. Here they have a very sombre tone throughout. Sort of like an art movie combined with some film-noir. Plus its only in the final 2 episodes that you get the answers to your questions. So you are left wondering. I saw the entire thing in a single sitting so I never had time to sit and think about each episode after it finished. So the story, or what the real point of the entire thing, was never clear. And because we can't see the end goal, it was difficult to root for something.The questions are similar to the Matrix. Our existence, what is its point, is it an illusion, what is god, etc.The graphics is beautiful. I felt it was a little strange, maybe even boring in the beginning, but as the story progresses, we will see that it conveys a lot of meaning (too many subtle things, and I may have missed most of them too). I am seeing this now in 2013, as a blu-ray. Only when I came here to review this did I see that this show is from 1998! I was so surprised, the graphics is like from 2010 at least! The audio too is great.Finally what can I say - If you like movies like Clockwork Orange, then yes, please check this out. On the other hand if you feel movies like 'Inception', 'Memento', etc., are unnecessarily complicated, this show might irritate you. :-).Thank You for reading. Cheers.",
        "Why do people like this anime? It's not only sad and depressing, but it is also boring as heck! Let's celebrate suicide and call it a show. No thanks dude. This is no sleeper hit, it sucks plain and simple.",
        "Serial Experiements Lain is one of the most ambitious, confusing, thought provoking, and surreal anime ever made and I liked it. The story follows a shy and alienated Japanese teenage girl named Lain who starts receiving e-mails from a dead classmate who used a virtual program unlike the Internet called \"The Wired\". Lain then starts using \"The Wired\" and things take a dark turn into the internet and the real world. The animation looked great for its time with great attention to detail, lots of close ups and atmospheric surreal areas that just blow your mind. The plot gets very confusing and unless the viewer pays attention it wont make any sense but the payoff in the end is great. This anime was ahead of its time because of the themes that it explored which included alienation, addiction to technology and self identity and the blurred line between reality and the virtual world. In our current digital world that keeps changing with the advancement of technology, these themes are just as relevant now as they were back then. This show wont be for everyone because of its slow pace and lack of action but I highly recommend it to hardcore anime fans and fans of TV that make you think.",
        "Generally speaking,Japanese anime products,as its by-product known as \"otaku\" culture, are full of contradictions. First of all, anime's \"artistic\" level has never been adequately estimated in its homeland(namely by audience, critics and mass medias) and usually \"discovered\" by foreigners(most sad example is \"Inoccence--Ghost in the shell\", Mamoru Oshii's best and probably last artistic film). Secondally, anime's highest level in dramaturgy had been achieved before it was \"discovered\" by world film festivals and foreign audiences(French people is said to have believed \"Candy Candy\"'s not a Japanese serial, because it was so sophisticated).\"Serial experiment Lain\" is a accidental postmodern masterpiece,made after anime's classical achievements(\"accidental\", because no one had intended to make a work of art). \"Lain\" uses plenty of postmodern devices: citation from purely historical materials,stylish eclecticism,\"open\" ending or circular structure and showing its own media's limitation(many scenes are openly \"two dimensional\" and look like rather abstract \"picture\").Having been made in the time of imitation and citation of past anime \"classical \"serials of 80s and later 70s, \"Lain\" is superb in its originality and the sense of the contemporary.After seeing this serial, \"Evangelion\" seems to be boring and too long(experimental works must be not so long as ordinary \"genre\" works,it is the rule from the time of silent era).I recommend to compare this serial with \"Kairo\" by Kiyoshi Kurosawa,the latter will seem to be some kind of a little out-dated remake of this serial.",
        "When people think of dark, psychologically complex, philosophical anime, they often mention \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". They mention \"Cowboy Beebop\", maybe \"Death Note\", and a bit more obscure choice is \"Paranoia Agent\" as well as the more recent \"Monster\" and \"Code Geass\". While a few of these might have their own merits, to me they pale in comparison to \"Serial Experiments Lain\".It starts off with a teenage girl committing suicide. Emails are sent by her after her death. This intrigues our main character, the introverted, socially awkward Lain, to check her email. This is the catalyst for an interest in \"The Wired\", the advanced version of the internet, and get's a higher grade computer. Soon enough, Lain becomes obsessed with it, changing her personality entirely.Lain's plot is nowhere near as straight forward as I explained it. It's a surrealistic anime, and it's unlikely you'll understand everything on first viewing. The animation lends itself to the strange, disconnected atmosphere. It touches upon themes of communication, obsession, and the dangers of advancing technology without beating you over the head with it. The greatest aspect of this show however is it's main character.Lain Iwakura spends all thirteen episodes going through a startling transformation of character. Now the change doesn't seem too bad at first. She becomes more popular, more outgoing, but soon enough Lain spirals into obsession, and from their everything goes downhill. I won't reveal what occurs to her, but it's quite a tragic turn of events throughout the remaining episode. As her personality expands, as we see more of her, the situation worsens. Lain has some of the most compelling characterization and development I've seen anywhere, remarkable when you consider the distant, non dramatic mood of the series. Ultimately over all it's themes, all it's surreal imagery, in the heart of the anime is Lain and her journey through a very personal hell.I won't give away the ending, I will say though there is no clear feeling meant to be left. Hope or gloom? Tragedy or triumph? It's a perfect ending for what I feel is the greatest anime written to date."

    "Neon Genesis Evangelion": [
        "This anime series is set fifteen years after a global disaster known as the Second Impact. It is centred on fourteen year old Shinji Ikari; he is summoned to the city of Tokyo-3 where he learns he has been chosen to pilot 'Evangelion Unit One'; to all intents and purposes a giant robot with biological components which can only be synchronised with pilots of a certain age. In Unit One Shinji will have to battle strange beings that have been dubbed 'Angels' whose arrival was foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Shinji's job isn't helped by the fact that the Eva Project is run by his estranged father who seems more interested in Rei Ayanami, the slightly mysterious pilot of Eva Unit Zero. As the attacks continue a third pilot, Asuka Langley Soryu. Shinji always had issues but this work takes an emotional and psychological toll on him.One might expect this to be an exciting 'fighting robot' series but it quickly descends into existential angst and depression... a very interesting twist that I'm sure viewers who watched this series when it was new would have been shocked by. The central story is full of religious symbolism but it isn't overtly religious in a way that might offend or irritate viewers. The characters aren't that likeable; many, especially Shinji, come across as whiny and others, notably his father, as unpleasant and bullying. Things gets distinctly strange towards the end with two final episodes that are likely to leave some viewers exasperated; others will find this only adds to the sense that this series is something different. Normally I watch anime in Japanese with subtitles but as the dub was available on Netflix I watched that and thought the English voice cast did a solid job. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anime fans; it may show its age at times but it is still solid and had effects on many later series.",
        "I have always heard that this series was really good and different so I wanted to give it a try and finally found a place to watch it. Well, it was definitely good and a bit different, but there are plenty of weird anime series and movies out there so this one was not too different. The only aspect that was a bit disappointing were the final three episodes as the series seems to be racing to some sort of mind numbing and insane conclusion, but instead we get what I will refer to as a non ending. So much build up literally goes nowhere; however, I do know there is a movie which I intend to watch and that it is what they say is an alternative ending, but I would have to think that it is the true ending because the last two episodes of this one really do nothing more than look into the main protagonist's mind leaving a huge hole full of questions about certain events that have transpired.The story has a young boy who has been living with his teacher as his father basically has abandoned him. That seems to be changing as the boy is invited to the installation his father is in control of; however, he is not there to be reunited with his father, but rather to pilot a huge mech/organic being known as an Eva to fight creatures called Angels who are responsible for the world being totally thrown out of whack. Through the adventures Shinji (the main protagonist) will make friends at school and fight angels along with Rei and Auska two other Eva pilots. Though there is something off and not entirely right about what is going on as strange details emerge with each Angel encounter.As I said, really good show with a lot of humor and such at the beginning. It starts out a bit like your more typical anime, but gets darker as it goes, but then totally goes blank for the finale. I do believe that the movie is supposed to be the ending as I read that the final two episodes of this are happening between this and the movie in Shinji's mind which is good because if you take what they present here there are so many questions left unanswered.So, a good series with some good twists and turns, I would rank it a ten, but they did seem to keep one hanging in terms to what happened during the second impact and the whole spear thing too. I am hoping the movie clarifies some of that. I enjoyed the battles with the angels, but a lot of time they were not at the forefront which did make this show a bit different. The first battle is literally told in a recap rather than in real time. I am hoping the movie clarifies more stuff, but as it is, it is an enjoyable anime series and one that does not go on for an eternity so you can watch it in a fairly short period of time.",
        "From what I've read, this was a very innovative series when it arrived in the mid nineties, so some of my reaction might have been different 17 years ago. Watching it now, a lot of it feels like stuff I've seen too many times before, but this series may well have come up with many of these ideas first. But there are other aspects of this show that would have been no better in 1995 than they are now.I found the early episodes just barely held me. There would be intriguing moments, but it just seemed like some giant-robot-battle series, and that's not something I'm really into.The occasional hints that there was more to the series than appeared on the surface didn't pay off until about two thirds of the way through the show. At that point things got more interesting, but they also got more confusing. An episode that goes back 15 years left me completely perplexed, throwing a bunch of poorly delineated characters at me and confusing me more at a time when it should have been clarifying things.The final episodes of the series threw weird ideas right and left as the show wandered entirely away from its mecha roots. Any hopes that the show would actually ever explain much of anything were laid to rest. The final famously aggravating episodes completely changed gears, offering some sort of emotional resolution but not a narrative one. At all. The show ended with its story completely unraveled.I'm probably going to watch the final Evangelion movie at some point because it presumably finishes the series' story in a way that the actual series didn't. But I'm not that hopeful that I'll be satisfied. The series is clearly written by someone who cared only for the characters and the psychology rather than the story.On the other hand, the characters are pretty interesting, with more depth and more complex histories than are typical of anime series. There are interesting moments in the series, although many of them open up mysteries that are never resolved. At times it was genuinely interesting, but it was all too much of a mess to be fully satisfying.",
        "Some years ago, I wrote a negative review of this series.But that review wasn't very fair actually, as it was mostly a complaint about Evangelion fans; and the fans of any work (Be it a movie, television show or videogame) are not the criteria in which said work should be measured.Back then in the late nineties, when I watched this show by the first time after very hyped by the articles of several anime magazines, I was quite impressed, as it felt different of many giant robot shows I had seen before; even without being the first of its kind, it's still pretty admirable the way in which this series captured the psychology of the main characters in an apocalyptic setting.As for the characters themselves, many of them are not very likeable, but I don't think they are really supposed to be \"likeable\", at least on a traditional sense. The main character is often seeing as \"wuss\", but he was supposed to be an antithesis of the brave heroes usual for tis type of series, showing how an ordinary teen (Keyword: Ordinary, as someone with no prior experience in fighting) would react if he was forced to deal with a supernatural threat, and how the \"cool\" elements such as the giant robots could be a source of horror.I appreciate a lot its ambition, atmosphere and excellent soundtrack. But i understand of why this is (still today) a pretty divisive series.The four new movies of the \"Renewal\" lack the same effect the series had, in my opinion. The episodic nature of the original gave it an \"day-to-day\" vibe which slowly progress into something darker as things keep getting worse for the (anti)heroes, eventually leading to the apocalyptic resolution of the movie.By contrast, Renewal feels honestly rushed, lacking the same impact the original series had, with its gradual revelations of the mysteries of the setting.Is Evangelion overrated? Well, maybe a bit. But it's not a bad series. I can get its appeal and see why it became so popular on the first place (Back then in the late 90s, there was a lot of anxiety towards the beginning of a new millenium, and some people genuinelly believed the world was going to end; of course, that wasn't the sole reason it became so popular, but it definately helped)A little gem of the 90s, and it has aged well, despite all its imitators.",
        "I cannot tell you how much this anime disappointed me. From all the positive hype and the best of its theme song as well as it's cover (Leeandlie for example), I was so looking forward to finally watch it after 23/24 years it aired. However, Shinji gave me such a headache from his whining and the fact, the English Dub actor who voiced him was absolutely not the best fit for the character in all honesty. I've read in the comments that I shouldn't watch the dub but the sub instead. In my case, no I'm not gonna bother watching the anime in sub since I didn't like the anime any ways regardless!Another thing that disappointed me was that the anime wasn't that great quality. Yeah obviously on the 1990s era I was born that animation was all 2-D and not 3-D. However I've seen better classic mecca anime series like \"Fighbird\" and \"Escaflowne\" who I personally think did it right. Evangelion art was underwhelming and like the characters looked totally ugly as well as the sceneries in the anime.Sorry to all the fans who worship Rei as their waifu but I'm not apart of the Evangelion fanbase.",
        "This anime has a deceptively simple premise with a futuristic city and a young boy who pilots a mecha. Yet there is a lot more beneath the surface and it goes rather insane with all sorts of mental problems coming to the fore. From a sci-fi perspective, the designs and concepts are quite interesting. From a psychological perspective, the exploration of the characters is fascinating but can get quite tiresome and repetitive.",
        "Fourteen year-olds (chosen for some undefined special talent) pilot giant bio-mechas into battle with \"Angels\" - an ill-defined, constantly-evolving, existential threat. Although there are moments of imaginative techo-action and a build-up to an intriguing story, the series (at least the first 24 episodes) is generally an uneven mix of teenage angst, opaque metaphysics, cryptic dialogue, and goofy humour that doesn't consistently succeed on any level. Also, the series is marred somewhat a juvenile approach to character development (especially Asuka, who comes across as how a 14 year old would write an obnoxious 14 year old character), uneven pacing, a lack of visual continuity (it's hard to figure out where anything is relative to anything else), and some unnecessarily pretentious filigree, especially the religious symbolism that is stirred into the apocalyptic imagery, (which ultimately adds little to the story and comes off more like a transparent attempt to make the standard 'mecha vs. monster shtick' sound 'important'). The final two episodes are divisive and I'm in the 'massive letdown' camp: 45 minutes of tedious Oprah-quality psycho-drivel as each of the already 2D characters gets flattened out even more. Too bad: if the story had maintained the momentum of the generally interesting first 2 episodes, if the characters hadn't been so puerile and simplistic, and if the resolution to the mystery of the \"Angels\" and the \"Second Impact\" had been as interesting as the build-up, this series might have been as good as I was led to believe. Note: I watched the ineptly subtitled version that was recently released on Netflix.",
        "15 years after much of humanity and the world was destroyed by an incident in the arctic (referred to as the Second Impact) from the unearthing of a creature known as an \"angel\", the remaining forces through the orchestration of the United Nations establish an agency called NERV to combat Angel attacks headed by Gendo Ikari. When the Third Angel appears and begins attacking Tokyo-III, Gendo's estranged 14 year old son Shinji is brought in to pilot the Evangelion Unit-01 (Eva for short), specially designed mechas composed of mechanical and organic elements that sync with pilots on a psychological level. Shinji is reluctant to pilot the Eva with his feelings complicated by his troubled relationship with his father, unresolved grief over the loss of his mother, and Shinji's insecurity in himself which manifests in his relationship with his guardian/NERV operations director Misato Katsuragi, Evangelion Prototype Unit-00 pilot Rei Ayanami, Evangelion Unit-02 pilot Asuka Langley Soryu. Shinji must reconcile his psychologically injuries from both historical trauma and weight that comes from piloting the Eva, while NERV and director Gendo's mission may not be as cut and dry as defending Earth from the Angels.Following the tumultuous production of Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water and Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honn\u00eaamise unmade sequel, director Hideaki Anno fell into a four year depression. Following a meet up with a representative from Kings Records where Kings Records guaranteed Anno guaranteed timeslot for anything Anno and studio Gainax produced, Anno began developing the series in 1993 with the intention being to create more anime fans and attract attention in the medium. The series was beset by production difficulties as well as creative ones with budget limitations reducing the number of Angels from 28 to 17 and creative decisions stemming from real world events such as the Tokyo Subway sarin gas attack prompted Anno to change elements of the script due to being \"uncomfortably close\" to reality. The series became a massive success and ingrained itself in popular consciousness with critics and academics analyzing and discussing the work beyond the initial release to the point Gainax themselves referenced the phenomenon in FLCL. The show is credited with popularizing anime series with greater concentration of resources into smaller episode batches and still allowing for success, meaning that many of the strongest examples of the anime scene from the mid-90s through early 2000s owe their existence to Evangelion.Evangelion starts off as a \"monster of the day\" type giant robot show only to gradually reveal a darker side to this familiar giant robot setting that gradually morphs the setting from unlikely teen heroes saving the world to a series that borders on psychological horror with horrific scenes that wouldn't feel out of place in a Cronenberg film. The damage the Evas and Angels do are very real and the consequences both physical and psychological do linger. In a way Evangelion can be seen as an extension of the themes presented in Mobile Suit Gundam in 1979 (before losing the plot with Mobile Fighter G Gundam, but that's neither here nor there) where the giant robots are treated with more weight and gravity in terms of story telling than previous entries. While Mobile Suit Gundam was admirable in its attempts at giving thematic weight to the genre with its explorations of war, the series was always at odds with itself thanks to its second purpose of selling model kits meaning it had to keep the Gundam and Robots aesthetically pleasing. With Evangelion however, there is no such concession made to \"toyetic\" appeal and not only are the Angels beautifully hideous as almost Lovecraftian abominations, but even the Evas which are supposedly the \"good guys\" in this scenario have a very angular look that hovers somewhere between human or predatory beast and some scenes making them almost Hellish in nature.The characters are about as far from likable as you can get from a show like this. Our primary lead, Shinji Ikari, is a self-loathing introvert with an inferiority complex who looks to others for validation despite his internal feelings of worthlessness. In a world where many cities are underwater, several species extinct, and much of the human population killed off, Shinji's alternating pendulum swings from self-loathing to self-pity can seem pretty selfish with the show often addressing Shinji's actions as such. Rei also has many layers to her character (many of which I can't get into because it requires going into spoiler territory) and her connections to Shinji on many levels are rich in thematic weight. Asuka is also quite good in her role being an abrasive and often abusive presence who berates Shinji and others at any available opportunity and ties her self-worth to being \"the best\" Eva pilot and while throughout the show Asuka is aggravating to endure, the show earns it by having a point to it with the series delving into Asuka's inner thoughts and past to examine the \"why?\" behind Asuka's words and actions.The story holds many threads that guide movement from point A-B including political infighting among those overseeing Nerv's operations, espionage elements, bureaucratic blockades, and shadowy agenda's all playing a part in moving the show's metanarrative forward. While all these elements are on display with much discussion related to their innerworkings and goals, Evangelion is less concerned with this part of the series often playing these parts of the plot in the background hidden behind layers of esoteric terminology, code names, and techno babble that feel almost like they're designed to be confusing to the audience while we focus more on the psychological and emotional states of our characters Shinji, Rei, Misato, and Asuka. Compound this with the fact that Shinji often asks what exactly the Evas and Angels are with no real satisfactory answer given and what answers that are given are often nebulous and vague. The convoluted innerworkings of the plot with the focus being on character rather than focusing on the \"how?\" and \"why?\" behind what we're seeing makes me view Evangelion as an almost successor series to something like The Prisoner. Much like how The Prisoner took tropes of the spy-genre of the 60s and played them for surrealism and allegory, Evangelion takes the tropes and trappings of a giant robot series and plays it for psychological analysis and existential discussion. The parallels can even be drawn to how the two series end with both The Prisoner and Evangelion having very \"experimental\" endings that leave the audience with more questions than answers and expect the viewer to take their own meaning (that, and of course the MASSIVE amounts of hate mail both Patrick McGoohan and Hideaki Anno both received from their audience following the series finales).Neon Genesis Evangelion has crafted quite the legacy for itself and set the standards for many anime that follow in its path (for better or worse). It's fair to say that without the success of Evangelion the anime landscape would be much different than it was/is with Evangelion paving the way for more daring material such as Cowboy Bebop, Serial Experiments Lain, and Paranoia Agent among others. Evangelion is an exhausting ride with its bleak pre-apocalyptic setting, heavy emotional burdens, and dives into dark reaches of the human psyche, but it's also an unforgettable ride that you won't soon forget.",
        "The main premise is as follows: Shinji, a 14-year-old child, is summoned by his estranged, seemingly cold and cunning father to NERV (an organization tasked with saving humanity from extinction, no less). His father gives him a directive to control the enormous robotic vehicle known as the Evangelion there to battle the monster that is invading Tokyo-3, the city where NERV's headquarters are located. These illusory \"monsters\" are known as Angels, and they appear to be unbeatable; even in 2015, conventional weapons have no effect on them. They can only be stopped by the Eva \"biomechs,\" which can only be operated by a restricted group of 14-year-olds. This only serves as the show's fundamental, opening concept.Excellent characters are present. This is significant because the focus of the narrative is on them rather than the Angels or NERV. One of the most convincing and really sympathetic anime characters ever created is Shinji Ikari. Some people might think Shinji is obnoxious and too emotional. But in reality, nobody wants Shinji to play the \"Hollywood hero\" and come through to save the day while beaming. Studio Gainax is aware of this and uses it to its full advantage in the series.The design features are incredibly distinctive; many of the Angels tower over Tokyo-3's skyscraper, and the Evas themselves are eye-catchingly colorful. The Angels take on many different forms, which helps Eva avoid the repetitive \"Monster of the Week\" format and keeps the action aspect of the series consistently engaging and fun (one angel takes the form of a gargantuan, blue diamond, while another is too small to be seen with the naked eye and acts as an organic virus, crippling NERV's computer system).Like the rest of Eva, the soundtrack is incredibly unforgettable. It does a great job of establishing the correct atmosphere and tone, using motivational trumpets to emphasize Asuka and Shinji's victories in battle and subtle introspective songs to portray Rei's persona. You won't get tired of hearing the opening theme throughout the 26 episodes of the series, which is one of my all-time favorites.",
        "I still have mixed feelings about last 2 episodes but overall I think it is awesome anime with mature philosophical questions. Animation looks so good and colors are perfectly used. I still need to watch the End of Evangelion and I can't wait to see it.",
        "Based on a manga series, Neon Genesis Evangelion is an animated series that earns the title of one of the best anime in history with very good reason. It is a series that manages to live up to being almost considered a masterpiece in many aspects. One of the reasons is obviously the animation that was done in a traditional way and the effort of the animators to create something that is appreciated on an artistic level is appreciated. The script is well structured, with a fairly deep story and characters that have something behind them. While there are moments of comedy, the story itself is quite serious, with leanings toward the psychological and philosophical. It is an apocalyptic story about humanity trying to prevent a possible apocalypse by angels. This makes the concept lean towards ancient dogmatic prophecies and the religious symbology that it manages to capture in a masterful way. The characters in this series are without a doubt the most memorable things there are. Among them we meet Shinji Ikari who is a rather introverted young man with a sad past and just wants to reestablish a bond with his father. Commander Ikari is the most mysterious and serious to the point that he is seen as insensitive. It is known that he is in charge of the NERV organization, but it seems that both he and the organization are hiding something. Shinji is left under the care of Misato, who is the most charismatic, but throughout the series it is discovered that he also has a sad past that he tries to hide. Shinji is accompanied by Rei Ayanami who is mysterious, serious and seems quite empty. Still, she also hides something fascinating behind her. Finally, Shinji's other partner is Asuka Langley who has quite a bit of character and is a girl with a great spark of ego and pride. She may seem like a rather aggressive and unfriendly girl, but she is also someone with a tough past and that helps to understand her character. The tragic past becomes fundamental and the series uses that to its advantage to explore the psychology of the characters. The psychological factor is undoubtedly the greatest strength that this series has, giving it enough depth to understand the emotions and personalities of the characters. What also greatly favors this animated series is its soundtrack that is impossible to forget. The songs used in the opening and closing credits are quite memorable, the last being a cover of one of Frank Sinatra's songs. Everything in this animated series is perfect until the last two episodes arrive where we delve into the minds of the characters in a kind of psychological examination. While that may be a good thing to make clear how affected they are, it ends up leaving the main plot of the series unfinished and the ending of the series becomes somewhat incoherent. The series concludes leaving loose ends that luckily could be tied up in one of the films that came later. Leaving the ending aside, the rest of the series is very admirable and the final verdict is that Neon Genesis Evangelion is an animation gem that every animation lover has to see. Its psychological characteristics, philosophical depth and religious symbolism undoubtedly make it a work of art. My final rating for this animated series is a 9/10.",
        "Anime has evolved significantly since Osamu Tezuka's AstroBoy aired in the 60s; not only has the art form diversified and grown but the demographic has also broadened for many many people in and outside of Japan. Neon Genesis Evangelion is just one of the many shows that's come from this nation-specific medium. Evangelion echoes bits of Mobile Suit Gundam, The Super Dimensions Fortress Macross, yet it adds its own little flavour to the mecha genre and adds a layer of psychology we don't usually see in these types of shows. It's a fun, sometimes a bit taboo, dystopian romp that uses robots and monsters to get its message across: the pilots of weapons of war aren't the clear-cut superheroes we make them out to be in our minds.Evangelion is colourful, big in scope, and filled with characters who aren't one-sided coins of clich\u00e9s: sometimes through their problems we see the funny side of things however rare they may be. This show is easily worth a watch; sure it panders a little too much with fan-service, but it tells a memorable sci-fi story worth a watch.",
        "Neon Genesis Evangelion is many things to many animation fans around the world; for some it's the defining anime of the 1990s, others it's a television drama that explores sorely needed spectacle, complexity and believability in sci-fi animations comparable to films like AKIRA, Ghost in The Shell and The Iron Giant, and to hardcore otakus it was their getaway drug into the medium of Japanese animation.This show tells the story of a very different 2015 after The Second Impact took place in 2000: and it still feels futuristic and immersive after the fact that we're in the year 2019 already (as of this review). It's like Back to the Future: Part 2, Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey; those works may have been wrong about the future (specifically) but they weren't wrong in the philosophical senses and scope of humanitarian foresight and how things changed from the periods those movies were actually made. And in that regard, Evangelion's exploration of man and machine is surprisingly potent for today considering this show deals with adolescent angst, sexuality and mental health through Shinji Ikari and his outspoken 'inferiority complex': feeling like he's living in his father's shadow and can never live up to people's proper expectations. Come to think of it, we're closer to robotics becoming synthesised with human thought and/or muscles everyday: mechanical limbs are probably the first big step towards achieving AI-assisted-sentience or vice versa.This show is epic, deep and unnerving in its exploration of humans, warfare, sensuality and living under the shadow of one's father. It's great having shows like Evangelion speaking and showing us stories we never knew we needed before it came along into our lives.",
        "\"Shin seiki evangelion\" is the most famous anime of all times. Almost 10 years before this anime was released(until today) is considered to be the most perfect and outstanding anime series of all. The soundtrack is amazing(with the famous ending theme song being \"Fly Me to the Moon\" as well as the classic Beethoven),the names of the characters and many of the things has a reason or a deep meaning behind it, like the three MAGI Supercomputers, Melchior, Balthasar and Casper (Gaspar),that are the names of the three wise men (also known as \"magi\") who, according to Christian legend, followed the guiding star to Bethlehem in order to give praise and gifts to the newborn Christ,the plot is very well written and full of meanings that can be open to discussion. I am not an Evangelion nerd, but I can understand why it was a winner of the'' Best TV Animation Award\". I am just waiting to be released in DVD here in Brazil to buy them.",
        "Wow. I just finished binge watching the series and I don't know what to feel right now. This quintessential anime series has left me with an experience of a lifetime. It is a perfect blend of mecha action and human emotion. The animation is definitely top notch, but it's the storytelling that's the real hero of this series.I could feel the tension from the first episode itself. The way the makers dealt with the three kids is plausible. I personally related a lot to Shinji Ikari and felt he was a lot like me. There were times where I cared a lot for both Rei and Asuka, given what all they had to go through. That being said, almost half of the series is somewhere between serious and lighthearted in terms of tone. It's the other half that starts to get intense with every episode and just hits the thinking viewer in the feels. I could feel like the last few episodes were directly talking to me. Yes, the same few episodes which are considered controversial for some reason.But aside from that, the show is highly entertaining, hands down. The humor is hilarious wherever it's present, and the mecha action is really cool or maybe even the finest I've seen yet. Some episodes are bound to leave you depressed, so better be prepared. Neon Genesis Evangelion is an unprecedented victory of sheer imagination and storytelling. For me, it's a perfect one as it both entertained and made me think. I can't thank the makers of this psychological sci-fi action anime enough, as a lot of dialogue has provided solutions to problems I have personally encountered and still encounter in life.",
        "I have heard for ages that Evangelion is the best there is. So I was quite surprised to find it sub-standard in just about all aspects. Admittedly it's 2020 and this was made more than 20 years ago. Still, this is basically giant robots against impossibly powerful giant (and very wierd) monsters. By episode 10 I was starting to yawn. Episode 12 was definitely the breaking point.Honestly, there are far better anime, far better plots, better story lines, better character development. Currently this has a rating of 8.5 on IMDB; I am puzzled to understand why. The only thing I can figure is that it appeals to a specific area of anime fandom. I have the same opinions regarding Transformers; no matter how popular it is, I find both the TV series and especially the movies just over the top absurd.The 12 episodes I slogged through on this basically boiled down to repetitive elements: stick teenagers in skin-tight costumes and put them in a giant robot (or naked, inside a giant robot, which seems like a silly contrivance since nothing but bare shoulders are shown). Launch the giant robots. Barely destroy the giant monsters, garnering extreme damage to surrounding countryside and the robots themselves. Retrieve robots, fix robots, lather, rinse, repeat. Over and over.The characters are 2-dimensional, from the emotionless girl to the clueless boy to the extremely obnoxious girl to the domineering father to the... well, it's a whole pot full of stock characters. There are many anime I have enjoyed immensely; this is not one of them. Trite, boring, redundant. By the time I finished episode 12 I really didn't care what happened next.",
        "Neon Genesis Evangelion is the most influential anime of the 1990s. It popularized the 26 episodes anime format, and reignited the 'giant robot' genre. The look of its characters has become standard too. What we have here is a truly thought-provoking and, most importantly, imaginative series that remains interesting throughout its run. Let's not forget that it's also entertaining. Most of the praise should go to Hideaki Anno. His direction was inspired. It only got better as the series progressed. There's a clever use of Judean and Christian symbols. The angels all look fantastic. The fights between the evas and the angels are thrilling, they take unexpected turns, and in short they're different from the usual giant robot fare such as Gundam. The characters are the series' greatest strength. Like real people they have pasts, beliefs and motives. They're well-realized for sure. Anno smartly put them into situations that viewers can relate to. In addition, there's that good old anime humour, but thankfully there's not too much of it so as not to tip the series from science-fiction to comedy. The music is another of the series' strengths. It's not just that Neon Genesis Evangelion has the best anime opening ever (sung by Yoko Takahashi), it's that the instrumental tracks composed by Shiro Sagisu remain some of the best and most effective for an anime. Sadly though Neon Genesis Evangelion suffers a bit during its run. Several episodes, especially in the first half of the series, are noticeably weaker than the rest. The ending too can provoke outrage from viewers, though I thought it was sort of neat. Overall, however, with its well-realized futuristic world, interesting characters, excellent animation, and a story that keeps surprising until the end Neon Genesis Evangelion stands head and shoulders above the big majority of anime. The two films that followed in 1997 (Death And Rebirth, The End Of Evangelion) tie up some loose ends but are not as good as the series. I highly recommend watching the series, it's one of the very best anime ever.",
        "I wish there was a story or something here...just cicada noises for 7 hours",
        "What started as a mecha series based on the same motives of Gundam and the works of Yoshiyuki Tomino (the difficulty of communication between people, especially between parents and their offsprings) with a good mix of serious and facetous completely destroys itself in the second half with an extremely convoluted plotline, recycled and hamfisted animation, uber-depressive tones and religious/psychological nonsensical babbling of the worst spieces that has NO reason to be than to hide the budget cuts, lack of ideas of the Gainax team and Hideki Anno's rapidly deteriorating writing, culminating in the nadir of the last 5-6 episodes where things with no foreshadowing or logic whatsoever are thrown at the face of the viewer hoping he does not notice the core senselessness of 99,99999% of what is on the screen because terms like soul or Longinus Lance are hamfistedly put in the mix. Tomino had the same problem of a rushed ending in a lot of his animes, including the masterpiece Ideon, yet it never happened (crappy Aura Battler Dunbine excluded) from HALF OF THE SERIES ALREADY nor he tried to pretentiously cover it up with thousands of meaningless cool words. Another thing that boggles my mind about this anime is the 70's sexism present all over the places. Was this really made in 1995 or in 1975? I don't get it. I'll give this thing a sufficient rating, but this is not the masterpiece the fandom wants you to believe. Yes, the mechas are cool looking, the intro song is catchy and the girls are all really hot (infinite love for Asuka with a soft spot for the first badass version of Misato), but that's not enough to salvage it on the whole. Twenty four years have not been kind To Evangelion. We'll see if the ending movie (I refuse to watch episode 25 and 26 alltogether) will turn out better or it will stain my memories of this franchise even more...",
        "*SERIES REVIEW While the layers of psychology, philosophy, and symbolism would crush most shows under their own weight and seeming pretentiousness, Anno handles them with adeptness and acute direction. He skillfully weaves them into the story to the point where everything makes complete sense in relation to the characters and storyline. In fact, if you really take time to analyze the story, the characters, and the relationship between the dialogue and visuals with the psychological, philosophical, and symbolic meanings, you'll see this series does indeed have more depth than almost all others that have attempted to tackle similar subjects. In fact, this is a series which almost has to be viewed several times, as there are recurring motifs (both visually and in the dialogue) which link important thematic elements strung throughout. And if you're not watching carefully, you'll miss them the first and maybe even second time around.I think the reason these ideas become so important is very simple, and that's because of the characters. Anno doesn't just create a random bunch of soulless, mindless, anime characters. He creates characters that everyone can relate to on some level. Because these characters have such range and depth, we begin to really care about them and their struggles. In the end their struggles become our own and they literally become mirrors of our own psychological profiles and problems. We begin to grieve as we watch them deal with such (self) destructive behavior caused by their circumstances and consequential frames of mind. It's because of this that the viewer actually cares about the more portentous moments, no matter how grandiose they become. I think it's very important for those out there to understand that all the elaborate complexities of NGE wouldn't matter without the characters that carry the weight and meaning of it all.NGE is a show of extremes. Ranging from scenes of palpable, visceral power that inspire shock and awe, to the most quietly surene, surreal, and beautifully touching moments. These scenes are woven together as fine and eloquently as the Beethoven Symphony they play in episode 24 itself. And like that symphony, even though the parts are outstanding, the whole is much greater than the sum.I believe this is a work of resounding artistic depth. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the absolute greatest pieces of fiction ever made in any medium. This may sound like hyperbole, but there have been few - if any - fictional works that have effected me both emotionally and psychologically like NGE has. If you put in the time and effort to actively watch this series, it will reward as many repeat viewings as you care to give it, as new layers and meanings will be uncovered each time. And I think that is, if nothing else, the first sign of a work of artistic genius.",
        "Considered by many a classic and some others one of the greatest anime of all time, Eva is an existential 26 episode series about duty, purpose, and self-worth disguised as an alien mecha fighter anime. That being said it falls into many of anime's classic tropes (and faults); it repeats plot / contains filler episodes, features overly sexualized young girls, and it explains away its \"science\" and plot points with ad-hoc jargon of convenience. The series in its short run has 3 fairly significant tonal shifts, somewhat breaking the series into 4 arcs, each of which are narratively built quite different, and all differ in strengths. The series started quite strong, however lulls in the middle, before hitting the gas pedal to the floor through till the end. Seriously the end of this series (while at its strongest artistically and imo one of the more enjoyable points) just doesn't match any of that of the earlier work, plot lines are ignored, it gets very meta. I had a tough time relating to any of the characters, each took a fairly exaggerated cliche role. The most I related to the main character was when he was quoted: \"Even when I learned to play the cello it didn't mean anything\" hahaha. With heavy Judeo-Christian overtones and built from Freudian frameworks of relationships, Eva is ultimately a show that asks some very fundamental questions about existence and existence's purpose, but doesn't come to any conclusions nor formulates any outlooks that I necessarily agree with. If you're a huge fan of anime and haven't seen this its worth checking out as a critique of the industry and its artistic failings. The series reflects and builds on a long history from the likes of Mobile Suit Gundam / Voltron and lives on through more recents like Gurren Lagann. I enjoyed Eva and will likely check out (some of) the subsequent films soon, but it ultimately shouldn't be a series you go into looking for plot.",
        "This supercooled and very aloof anime series is arguably one of the most overrated \"cult hits\" of the anime genre. The monsters and angels and machines are presented quite neatly, but do not hide the weak narrative structure, the intolerable characters and the mass of clich\u00e9s that this series has to offer. Unfortunately not a really good experience and certainly not an insider tip for anime-critical movie buffs.",
        "Neon genesis evangelion is just another science fiction touched anime that could not get me keep watching. I'm not interested in the characters, the story or anything. After two episodes this is enough. Additionally the graphics are, to be fair because of its age, not very good to watch. I gave it a chance because of its high rating but this was not worth my time. Maybe if they remake the thing and release it weekly I would give it another chance. With this said go watch Attack on Titan or Demon Slayer before watching this. It's only for hardcore anime fans or guys who like the anime science fiction thing.",
        "Neon Genesis Evangelion is arguably the best anime out there. It functions on a variety of levels, providing an engrossing, action packed sci-fi story while also grappling with serious themes of growth and psychological development with complex characters. It takes anime and raises it to the level of art.On the surface, Evangelion looks like another giant robot show along the lines of Transformers. Giant piloted robots called EVAs have to fight super powered aliens called Angels. However, after a few episodes, it begins to subvert the genre, moving the emphasis from the war machines to the people, even as it continues to provide hardcore action.Take the treatment of Asuka for example, the shrewish teen EVA pilot. In any other show, she would just be an annoying whiny character. However, towards the end, the show reveals in disturbing detail just how her personality ended up the way it did. We end up feeling guilty for having disliked her.At the same time, the show still delivers all the fun things we've come to expect from anime. The early episodes have some excellent fan service, especially from Major Katsuragi. Although this diminishes later in the series, there is also graphic violence to keep the viewer's interest.The show does has some weak points. The Christian imagery they use never really goes anywhere, and the show's makers admit it had no other significance than the fact that it seemed exotic to Japanese viewers. However, this is a minor point in an excellent series.",
        "When I watched it for the first time I quit after the first episode and I thought \"an anime power rangers, a waste of time I guess\" but came back to it two months later and decided to be a bit more patient and watched it through completely and did not regret it whatsoever. Now I have rewatched it the 2nd time for my review so here it goes.The story was amazing, it was complex with very good worldbuilding though a bit abstract, had good pacing, and was very pretty consistent. The atmosphere, the tone, the themes, were all remarkable and well created though the action was a bit lacking and undeserved. It has a confusing and slow start but starts making sense as time goes on even though at the end of the series it does leave out some questions. Oh and the amount of hints and hidden messages in this anime is ridiclous so it's proably a good idea you pay very close attention to it.The characters are probably one of the most interesting aspects of this anime. They all have flaws that are similiar to one another and in some ways the cause of their flaws comes from a single antagonist. They are well written and some of them had some development throughout the series.The sound was amazing and the music was really well done. The intro and outro will forever be legendary. The sound choices were well though of and the music tone in certain scenes were very good. The visuals were pretty good considering the time it came out in it. Being quiet similar to Cowboy Bepop in terms of artstyle and animation. The character designs, the facial expressions all well done.Overall a very enjoyable anime. The deepest anime and most depressing I have ever seen. It made me feel a way that I have never felt before. A classic anime..and one that you should definelty watch!"

Ok for real though who Is that dense I've met and seen dense people screw it im dense but for real THOUGH YOU GONNA DO MY GIRL RISA LIKE THAT NAH uh no you ain't but that was a fun beutiful anime to watch so goofy loved it to my core wish there was more of the college life like ita kiss but still SO VERY GOOD LOVED IT.",
        "Lovely Complex is pretty much the best rom com I've ever watched. There's nothing like it. It's seriously hilarious and the characters are all well done and super relatable!!Highly recommend it if you are looking for a funny show!!",
        "This series is very bautiful.it' well nutritious with laughter, comedy as well as romance.it was really hard for me to go without leaving a review.cuz this anime is that good. Recommended at highest rating points.",
        "The simply premise of a tall girl falling in love for a short guy is unique and interesting, this anime is from 2007 so that explains it hasn't the best animation but the magic comes from the amazing and lovely characters, even the friends of the mains characters are really cool, it's really fun anime and with all the faces that the characters do I was laughing so hard the whole time.Definitely highly recommended even if you don't like anime in general but like romantic comedies.",
        "This is one of the best anime ive ever watched! Its funny and uplifting while telling a story of a friendship turning into love. If you love having a laugh I highly suggest this anime!",
        "I loved every minute of this series! It had me in stitches, I was laughing so much! Risa Koizumi and Atsushi Otani have such a comical relationship and yet from the beginning you are rooting for them to get together. The series also portrays the insecurities of a first relationship very accurately and I'm sure most people can relate. Unlike many other anime series', I didn't feel frustrated by the writing or the lack of progress. And, having listened to it in Japanese (and read English subtitles), I commend the voice actors for conveying the emotions portrayed on screen excellently! All in all a series well worth watching (and re-watching)!",
        "I've watched this anime so many times I've lost count, yet with every re-watch I grow to love the characters even more and there's always something new I notice.Despite the iffy animation and the style it has a certain charm about it and the voice acting is phenomenal and unique with being in Kansai-ben.It remains one of the funniest, sweetest and relatable series I've ever had the pleasure to watch, however it is not without some faults:The will they won't they DOES get annoying but it's 100% true to the source material.Even from reading the manga Koizumi really agitates me when she chooses to go with the other guy to the concert, the AMOUNT of time she spent head over heels in love with Otani and she goes and does that just added unneccesary filler to me. (That is why I'm knocking a star off)I would have loved to have seen a FULL adaptation of the manga. This series ends just as they graduate from high school but the manga follows them up until college.Despite these shortcomings you also have:A great soundtrack, the 1st OP is still my favourite though.The supporting cast aren't just background characters and they mesh well with the main two. They of course don't get as much screentime but I cared for them.Otani and Koizumis friendship and banter is just everything, I personally love the first half of the series more because the comedy is a lot stronger; there is a tonal shift after the confession (which I don't blame) but I do feel episodes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 to be the strongest comedy wise.Overall it is a nostalgic masterpiece that always has me hungry for more of these beloved characters. (It's never too late for a season 2 though! )",
        "Loved it.This anime made me laugh, made me frustrated for Risa at times, but, it ended the best way it could. The characters are amazing with each their own unique personnality.I can't recommend it enough.",

        "This was my first anime and this anime is so good, I mean it contains everything, everything is perfectly summed up and balanced, it does makes you cry and laugh at the same time, never saw a show like this, totally recommended for everyone, being a short guy myself, I found it pretty good. And truly the comedy in this anime is top notch, brilliant in every scene, and the scenes which are emotional will directly connect with you, you'll cry for sure, I wish it to be more popular, and I really was hoping there would've been planning for 2nd season, but sadly there's no 2nd season, I beg to the creators please bring us a 2nd season.",
        "This is it - The Unbearable Lightness of Being in it's essence! Someone said that it is hidden in ignorance and apathy, but I fundamentally disagree with this statement and believe that the wings will acquire only those who want to know more, to be more proficient, who make their tries and don't afraid to make mistakes. Lovely Complex is anime about that kind of persons - about children, the better ones, who we were when we were young.Exactly this an amazing work of Japanese animation will help you to regain long forgotten sense of youth. The sense of time when you probably do not know anything about unpleasant sides of life, but you are pretty sure that life is bright and certainly beautiful, that you need to clear it up what exactly it is. Very often this innocent feeling is completely absent from our own real lives, and absence of it transforms them into a drab existence.Lovely Complex softens the soul so touching and tender that you won't notice the change in yourself immediately. But you will, because all of us, without exception, are familiar with the feelings experienced by the main characters. At least all human beings, who tend to doubt no less than for breathing. And it will make you want to fly because of how easily, gracefully and sincerely these feelings are showing.It will make you want to return to your 15-16-17, cross out the date of birth in the passport, wake up finally from the day-numbing mercantile wheel of fortune, breathe the smell of fireworks, wake up in the mornings cheerfully and happily with the thoughts of your friends, not abominable routine.Everything written above doesn't mean that Lovely Complex is recommended only for those who are looking for oblivion, euphoria and youthful absolute-maximum happiness. Oh, no, this anime will stole your peace, you will want to experience all at once, to discover life in new ways. And It will awake you for life, sharpen your feelings and bestow an impulse to regain those subtle ephemeral moments that fill our lives with meaning, those moments which true value we can appreciate only after a while. And no matter how many of them you will find in your past, it won't be enough. That's why just the thought of being sitting within four walls alone in front of flickering monitor will cause you at least a heartburn.Yes, despite the fact that the complex is 'lovely', it will reward you with a great motivating kick up the backside. Because it is absolutely impossible not to fall in love with the main characters. It is impossible not to reconsider your retrograde views on school anime genre. It is impossible not to forgive mistakes of the industry. Lovely Complex redeems the sins of the genre by its very existence, soothes, sets a peaceful mood and increases the number of smiles in the world - it is 100% impracticable not to smile while watching. Your lips will break into a smile because of what you'll see on the screen - absurdity; humor; foolishness, that comes not from stupidity, but from despair; courage that comes from a hopelessness; the first love; trembling hamstrings; thrill of the heart - all of us went through this, but not everyone managed to keep a joy of discovery. But don't be confused by the words written above, this one is that rare case when rose-colored sentiments will not cause you an allergic reaction - it is impossible to have allergic to yourself!This work is light and easy, but at the same time it is stubborn and persistent as the inner voice, which repeats 'Everything will be fine'. And it certainly will, if you won't sit idly by. Lovely Complex contains one simple well-defined thought - unenterprising persons will lose. Always. For the love you have to struggle. For the sake of the friendship you have to be ready for anything.The authors invented the real time machine, which allows to re-experience the long-forgotten feelings, this travel could be bit painful (yes, unfortunately time doesn't have reverse direction), but it is so comprehensive, so sincere and plausible. And you love, and you believe, and all of this is just because of some anime about Japanese teenagers... What is it if not a real magic?"

    "Hellsing Ultimate": [
        "Not being familiar with the older 13 episode series, then I had no expectations for this series. I sat down to watch it with a clean slate, so to speak. Was told that it was a really great series by an acquaintance, so I decided to give it a go.I will say that the art style is somewhat different from the Manga that I am used to watching, but it wasn't bad. I liked the style of art in \"Hellsing Ultimate\", it was dark, it had an edge and it was nicely rendered. Smooth animation and interesting characters really helped the series along.\"Hellsing Ultimate\" has a lot of blood and violence in it, so it may not be suitable for all people. Just a word of warning. I, however, did enjoy it. The vampires here were brutal, devilish and beastly - read not having big hair and sparkling skin.The characters in the series were nicely thought up and well put to the screen. However, I think that they could have made the episodes longer and given the characters a chance to show their personalities and nature more on the screen. Given them a chance to delve into character development, as some of the characters were a bit shallow and could have benefited from a more in-depth presentation.There was a lot of jumping between the episodes, in the sense that there was an red thread in the storyline, but individually the episodes were a bit too skittering and 'flash bang'. By that I mean, it was all great, action-packed and full of blood, but once one episode was over, the next would skip entirely to something else.One thing did puzzle me, well it is just me being petty, but why did everyone speak Japanese? It didn't make any sense that people from the Vatican or South America spoke Japanese, or that the Nazis spoke Japanese. But hey, it was a Manga animation, so it was easy enough to bear over with that.Having seen this new series, it sort of sparked an interest to get a hold of the old series and check that out as well. The 2006 \"Hellsing Ultimate\" series was great entertainment and it well worth checking out, for both newcomers to the Manga scene and for avid fans alike.",
        "Even when I liked the first \"Hellsing\" anime adaptation from the year 2001, I guess I'll have to admit this version (Which is far closer to the original manga by Kohta Hirano) is vastly superior in almost every aspect.Despite having a somewhat similar beginning to its television counterpart, after the first two episodes the plot from \"Hellsing Ultimate\" becomes a totally crazy roller-coaster of extreme action, horror, gore and even some black comedy...And personally I found this combination to be incredibly entertaining to watch.While the plot isn't anything incredibly complex or \"deep\" as other Japanese animations that try to include some kind of \"philosophical\" content, the twisted fun delivered by \"Hellsing Ultimate\" is enough for me to include it among my personal anime recommendations. 8.5/10",
        "So recently i got to watch this multiple 10 part OVA series after watching the original and boy, they made such massive changes on this! The whole anime is a lot more sharper, thrill-riding and unpredictable. The original was kinda more sugary but good enough for an early horror 00's anime series. However, this time in the late 00's to 10's, this anime had more chillis and fierceness involved in it. Seras Victoria is not that cutesy little british policewoman that you've experienced watching the original. But now, she is literally a badass chick that is the defination of destruction. Seriously, it was such a good shock that they really did change her personality out of cleverness and boy it suits her!Alucard is more hard on her on this one, he has calling her an idiot several times in the series and you'd be thinking that's really not the original Alucard we know here. Still he's a brillant character and like he's a lot more scarier then his original form. Really I dont care, it makes him even more badass and invincible!I was literally sad towards the ending that Hellsing grew to be an old woman like honestly, I hate the fact they are nearly killing her off as a character. Yeah I know she doesn't die though but still, it is sad that she did grew old and that'll be us too lol! Of course Victoria and Alucard are still going so I wouldn't worry about them on that lol! I really really want a third installment instead of a prequel, i wish they made it already! I just love the series! 9/10 it deserves!",
        "I just finished watching the third installment of the long awaited Hellsing Ultimate OVA series. In a nutshell, Hellsing is about vampires. And if you're thinking, \"Oh, this is going to be like Blood+, Vampire Hunter, Black Blood Brothers, etcetera\"... you're very, very wrong.This is exactly the kind of anime that can keep you panting for the next episode. A very well knit product it encompasses intrigue, betrayal, conspiracy, gore, sarcastic humor and plenty of ass-kicking action, John Woo vampire style.If you enjoyed the mediocre 13 episode TV series, you're in for a glamorous treat with the OVAs. The OVA stays very true to the manga, almost panel for panel, much like 'Monster' in that respect. Each installment covers the incidents of one volume of work (by the way, I highly recommend the manga as well) and is a visual spectacle. The voice acting (done by the same people who did the TV series) is quite good and even the English dub is fairly commendable. The characters are much more polished and darkly drawn than the TV series too. The music is as good as what we were treated to in the TV series with a mix of eerie gothic/baroque and electronica.All in all, one of the best animated series I've seen. Highly recommended.Warning: If you're quesy about blood and violence, I suggest you steer clear, because this series is a cornucopia of gore.",
        "Synopsis: Tasked with defending England from undead and supernatural assailants, the Hellsing Organization led by Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing (Mizuhashi Kaori), grows strained as the frequency of vampire attacks increases. Hellsing's own greatest weapon, an ancient and powerful vampire named Alucard (Nakata Jouji) along with his new servant Seras Victoria (Orikasa Fumiko) are quickly drawn into the central conflict. The appearance of Millenium, a new faction hosting an army of vampires, threatens to engulf all of London in a cataclysmic war as they square off against Hellsing as well as the Vatican's Section XIII Iscariot.Characters:For a show so fundamentally focused on its own various factions, Hellsing doesn't actually have all that large of a cast, opting instead to represent its various organizations through a handful of recognizable characters and a moderate supporting cast. While Alucard, Integra, and Seras are the focal characters of the show, the story often wanders away from them to investigate the goings-ons of other notable characters and companies such as Alexander Anderson and the Vatican. Around the midpoint of the story these various perspectives and characters start to come together as the show begins its long and drawn out climax.Both the most iconic and notable of the cast is Alucard himself who embodies much of what Hellsing is about. He's a vampire through and through and not only presents all of the familiar traits and abilities of his folklore counterparts but a host of far more vague powers such as teleportation, minion-summoning, and near-invulnerability. He's a cruel and ruthless killer who's gruesome style of combat often ends with him just as ragged and bloody as his opponent. His most common strategy is to allow his opponent to blow him to bits while mocking his own powerlessness before reforming and quickly dispatching them. It's a very weird fight dynamic and many of his fights fall into this formula however eventually more back and forth exchanges are established.The issue that arises with Alucard is that, between his tendency to let his own enemy inflict ostensibly lethal wounds upon him, his seemingly ever-expanding list of strange abilities, and the general gory aesthetic of the show - it becomes increasingly hard to tell when Alucard is actually in any real danger. The tension and suspense of each fight involving him quickly dissipates and drains the fight sequence of all meaning when he appears so openly infallible. What the viewer might insinuate to be severe blows against him are often discarded as Alucard merely playing with his opponents. His frequent 'apparent deaths' quickly desensitize the viewer to both his own well-being as well as that of vampires in general. With people getting their brains blown out and quite literally painting the walls red with their own blood, it's hard to tell what is at stake if anything when they keep coming back.The other character worth touching upon is Alucard's servant Seras Victoria, a police girl he converts into a vampire at the start of the series. Initially she is played off as somebody in way over their head - thrown into an outlandish situation involving the Hellsing Organization and her own newly acquired vampire status. In the early episodes she is almost entirely relegated to an awkward comedy-relief role however Hellsing eventually re-purposes her into somebody more action-oriented. It felt as if the show couldn't make up it's mind on what she was supposed to be - dopey and comedic fan-service character or tragic and badass vampire warrior. One trait often ended up compromising the other and it was hard to take her more grave scenes seriously given her initial foolishness and role in the show.Art/Animation:Were there a single word that could encompass all of Hellsing's style and appeal it would be gratuitous. Like any good vampire show, it was obsessed with blood. Hellsing is all about overkill. Too many guns, too many bullets, too many enemies, too many bodies, too much blood - it created an aesthetic and presentation out of pure excess and it certainly found unique qualities within this approach. When it came to bloodshed, it didn't shy away from showing some truly brutal material and the subject matter of war was a terrifying place for this style to manifest. This visual brutality and excess is key to understanding what Hellsing is about and how it tries to appeal to its viewer as much of its allure is closely tied to the outlandish nature of its characters and these grotesque characteristics.The show's visuals are pretty decent - though lackluster and sometimes even awkward during the first 4 or so episodes, the animation quality steps up over the course of the show and solidifies itself fairly strongly around it's midsection and onward. Punctuated by heavy shadows, stark lighting, and more eye-glasses glare than you can handle, Hellsing establishes a distinct visual appearance early on though initially some of its characters would move strangely and exhibit exceedingly odd postures because of their lanky designs. For the most part, the character designs of the cast all fit well with one another though there were a few exceptions such as Schr\u00f6dinger and Rip van Winkle who felt outlandish and out of place when juxtaposed to Hellsing's other more grim and callous designs. The occasional, oddly cliched-looking, gag scene also upset the show's aesthetic on top of being completely unfunny.Story:Hellsing's story is where it suffers the most for a variety of reasons. The first few episodes follow a pretty similar pattern as the viewer is introduced to the show and its characters. A vampire sent by Millenium is wreaking havoc and Hellsing and Alucard have to intervene. Some faceless background characters are killed and transformed into ghouls and there are some highlights of Integra, Seras, and Walter the butler before Alucard ultimately ends up killing whatever the threat is. This kind of bland introduction to the show leaves the first half feeling uninspired though with the proper introduction of Millenium near the series' midpoint, things start to heat up. The initially gruesome aesthetic finds new footholds in the subject matter of war and the degree of its excessive nature doubles and triples as the action mounts.One particular problem Hellsing had was in the pacing department. Given how it's 10 episodes were divided into roughly 50 minute-long installments, it often felt as if each episode would drag out it's own self-contained action and plot before expiring. Fights would last an exceedingly long time and the show never seemed to tire of vampires and supernatural abilities ripping through people and ghouls like endless fodder. This approach set up the atmosphere of the show quite well early on but its prolonged use to kind of fluff up the episodes grew tiresome after a while. Monologues as well were a huge problem for the show's pacing as they would often state and restate the same esoteric thing for the sake of emphasis. This gave a lot of the dialogue a certain monotonous tone to it.Possibly the biggest shortcoming of the show is in its final few episodes. Hellsing's midsection does a decent job of revitalizing the show with improved animation, gory action scenes, and a surprisingly exciting war development. However, once the the pieces are in place and the story is once again in motion, it rather quickly devolves into incoherency. Hellsing is far more interested in the factions its characters belong to and the gore of its action scenes than the characters themselves and this leaves them feeling not only under-explored but downright confusing near the end of the show. Certain character twists and reveals make less and less sense, the viewer lacks context to understand the implications of many new powers and abilities being revealed, and the whole point of it all is kind of lost amidst the rambling presentation.Music:Hellsing's soundtrack is likely much what you would come to expect of a modern vampire show. It's Gothic and haunting yet dabbles with some guitar, electronica, and jazz with varying degrees of success. Most of the tracks fit the show well enough but there wasn't a memorable tune to be found and they certainly didn't rise above merely supporting the show's visuals and plot.Final Thoughts and Rating:Hellsing is crippled by a number of narrative issues and others besides yet it is not completely bereft of entertainment. It's claim to your attention lies in its graphic content or rather - how graphic its content is. It has a handful of cool scenes and the uncensored display of carnage set against a dark and bloody atmosphere definitely allowed the show to stand out among other similar action shows.Rating: 5I gave Hellsing a 5 because, while it presented a surprisingly grisly look at the vampire genre and the brutality of war, it suffered from a myriad of issues across all categories. Alucard felt invincible and damaged the tension of many of the scenes in which he was involved, Seras felt tonally confused and her awkward stabs at humor somewhat upset her later developments into more of an action-oriented character. The show's visuals were at times impressive and at others a little crude and lackluster. Hellsing's story was circuitous and even confusing despite a rather simple and predictable plot.Recommendations:If you like blood, guts, and occult Nazism then this show was likely crafted specifically for you. If you are a fan of guns, bullets, and way too many of them then similarly so - you'll love the kind of over-the-top, stylized action that Hellsing has to offer. Anybody turned off by gratuitous blood and violence should probably stay as far away from this show as possible as it truly makes it it's business to deliver on those elements above all else and in the greatest excess.",
        "This is the second (and more faithful) adaptation of the Hellsing manga series. Ratings for all 10 episodes,Ep 1 ~ 8/10; Ep 2 ~ 8/10; Ep 3 ~ 8/10' Ep 4 ~ 9/10; Ep 5 ~ 9/10; Ep 6 ~ 8/10; Ep 7 ~ 9/10; Ep 8 ~ 7/10; Ep 9 ~ 7/10; Ep10 ~ 8/10The vocal performances are spot-on (English dub, with the same voice cast as the 2003 version; standout is Steven Brand's balls-out crazy assassin-priest, Alexander Armstrong), the artwork is great, and the mythology of the Hellsing Organisation, the Iscariot Order, the Round Table, the Millennium Group, and the vampires/freaks/ghouls is pretty deep. Unfortunately, whilst the overall plot is clear, there's so much going on (organisational/political rivalry and intrigue) that some of the details are confusing. The music's not as good as the original series, and it lacks the atmosphere of that show. It also includes ridiculous 'chibi' sequences, which feel out of place and wreck the tension of some scenes (they might be in the manga, but I'm judging this solely as an animated show). However, the big win for this version is its lack of censorship restriction (it's OVA), allowing for some extreme violence and bloodshed (including stuff that's pretty disturbing - especially if you're not expecting it). For me (minority opinion, I know) the 2003 version is better, but this still gets an overall rating of 8/10.",
        "\"Hellsing Ultimate\" is for a pure masterpiece.At the beginning I thought: \"Oh, only 10 episodes, that's not very much!\", but then I saw that each episode is 1 hour and that I probably have to take a little more time for it.But I'm very glad I did it.The main character, Alucard, is one of the best characters that has ever walked the screen in terms of character design.His character is also well written and made me ask a lot of \"dude, what kind of guy is that!?!?\" - moments.The other characters complement everything pretty well too.Also worth mentioning are the incredibly good animations and the dark atmosphere of the series.Unfortunately, I'm often lost in thought while watching and therefore didn't quite understand some things in the end, but that's just another reason to watch the anime a second time.I recommend everyone, even if they don't really like old anime, to give the anime a try.Just watch the first episode and then see if you can manage to let go of the anime again.I doubt it.",
        "\"The bird of the Hermes is my name, eating my wings to make me tame.\"Hellsing Ultimate is a 10 part OVA anime based on the Hellsing manga that follows it very closely compared the earlier attempt which contained 13 episodes and had to stray off because of catching up the the story at the time. And unlike many, I did liked that early attempt and still do but this, however, COMPLETELY BLOWS IT AWAY!! Bigger budget, better animation, better action, better plot and way more GORE.The story follows Hellsing organization which has only one goal, to rid the world from vampires/monsters. And they accomplish this mainly by their trump card, ALUCARD (DRACULA in reverse), an immortal and powerful vampire that does the bidding of his master, the leader of the organization, Integra Hellsing.Since they followed the manga to the fullest, the story this time around was a lot better and actually went somewhere. Still, plot isn't the reason to watch this anime because its the action and gore and the awesomeness of Alucard that makes Hellsing a joy to watch. The anime is filled with gruesome bloody sequences with people and monsters being totally decimated in thrilling and amazing ways.ALUCARD is probably the most badass and awesome Anti-hero I have ever seen in an anime. He taunts and humiliates his enemies before ripping them to shreds, takes extreme joy in the act and really defines the word MONSTER when doing all this. But at the same side you see that he has a softer side which he hardly ever shows and there is more to him then just being an all out monster. Also, I don't think I've ever seen the main character to be THE STRONGEST in the whole anime and the world it shows. Usually the hero/anti- hero/lead has to train hard, overcome obstacles, acquire knowledge and powers to become strong and defeat the enemy. But not here. Hellsing's like \"Screw all that. Alucard is the most powerful. Enjoy.\". And I loved this. Such a refreshing thing to see.The anime isn't without its flaws however. One thing that REALLY bugged me is that when all the stuff is going down, carnage and destruction everywhere, the anime decides to take the time off and do some character development or deliver a monologue or a speech or something. But it wasn't never really good at this stuff so it turns into a drag and all you want is to see more action. The pacing wasn't that good at times. And then there were those typical anime comedy thrown in the mix, which popped up in the most atmosphere breaking moments and really annoyed me, only a few times it was actually funny and worked.Animation quality was superb. Detailed characters and violence and stuff. The soundtrack was a mixed bag.Overall, I really enjoyed the anime. It's a definite watch for anyone who wants vampire centric story without any lovey dovey/teenage/high school stupidity and just delivers the awesome gory action we want.8.3/10",
        "This is an excessively violent and gory spectacle brought together with grand animation and some lovely voice acting. The only thing that bothers me is the soundtrack it's good for the most part but a few of the later episodes have some odd choices for the music.\nOverall this is just spectacular check it out!",
        "The whole plot is not convincing enough, there's not a progression of events to build up a great storyline. Yet the action scenes are great, full of violence and good effects. Enjoyable but sad to say forgettable.",
        "Hellsing Ultimate is probably the bloodiest, goriest and most violent anime I've ever seen. It's a lot more violent and darker than the types of anime that I'm in to, but it was awesome! The beginning of the anime feels extremely edgy and somewhat cringe, especially with that one Valentine character with the piercings. But once the story gets going, it becomes something you can't take your eyes off of. It's fascinating to watch everything unfold. The art style is sort of similar to Death Note. The animations during the fight sequences are probably the highlight of this show. They're visceral and exciting. I will say though, this anime has a rather dark and bleak tone to it. It's not really my kind of style, but the story kept me very invested. The story becomes more and more interesting as the show progresses. I admire how the anime takes a moment out of the rather dark and serious tone to try and inject a bit of cute humor throughout, I appreciated that. They definitely offer a bit of comic relief. Seras was my favorite character, she represented the more human side of the show. Her character development was fantastic. Alucard was also awesome. The whole artistic visualization and concept of his true form was insane! This actually turned out to be quite a fantastic anime. It raised some really intriguing questions on topics like humanity, religion, death, power, immortality and centuries-old agendas. They tie everything up really nicely and pack all of these ideas and concepts together so that it becomes a comprehensible and intriguing story that keeps you thinking even after the credits roll. I thought it was a very solid and well-crafted show with a unique and interesting style. I watched the whole thing in 2 days and I'd watch it again if I'm ever in the mood for something on the darker and bloodier side. I recommend this anime to anyone, just as long as you can get past the violence, gore and edginess. It's also worth noting that this is one of the few anime that actually benefits from the English dub. This is because you get to experience all the different accents like Scottish, German, French, British and Italian that you wouldn't get from Japanese voice actors. It just makes it that more immersive and gives it more character.",
        "'Hellsing Ultimate': This is not exactly a remake of the original 13 Episode 'Hellsing' anime series. This is an OVA that is retelling the 'Hellsing' story in the animation style and plot characteristics derived from the manga. Compared to the first anime series, the animation is much improved and the characters have a noticeable increase in depth. Thankfully the same voice actors are retained in this series and a few additional ones can be found. While the story in this version is not quite as seamless as in the first anime series, the plot is at least more adherent to the original layout of Kouta Hirano. I certainly look forward to seeing the completion of this anime and recommend the series to any serious fan of the horror genre or anime medium.",
        "Hellsing Ultimate after this, in principle, a remake of Hellsing is not needed, as for me. Maybe after a while and then just update the graphics and that's it. At the expense of the series, I must admit that there are differences between 2001 and 2006, and they are serious. Not to mention that in the 2001 version, the episode runs 25 minutes, and in 2006, 45 minutes. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. I will say this If you watched Hellsing, then in Hellsing Ultimate there will be deja vu until about 4-5 episodes, and then in history there will be such repetitions and characters just a feast for the eyes. Of course, for those who are not against cruelty and much more related to it. I'll just add that in Hellsing Ultimate, the main vampire Alucard and Seras Victoria differ in character from the story of Hellsing in 2001, as for me this is more plus than minus. Especially if you watched the 2001 version. That's all you need to know about this story. I would like to add if you want to find a series about cruelty and find out if the reason can justify this cruelty, then you have come to the right place. By the way, in addition to blood and vampires, will there be something else that drives crazy deeds? We thought about it and whether there is an excuse and a goal for this, and in general what it can end up with and this can be enough, and you will find out while watching it.And if you miss the usual and classic vampires who are afraid of the sun, I think it's not worth explaining why. And while the story should be somewhat down to earth and restrained, Hellsing 2001 will suit you.And if something so tough, but interesting enough with a large scale without restrictions, then it will suit you\nHellsing Ultimate 2006\nBut I would advise you to watch all versions of Hellsing, since Hellsing 2001 tells the initial plot in more detail, and in Hellsing Ultimate 2006, they immediately throw in the first 4 episodes concisely conveyed the meaning of the previous version, and went to the new plot\nPersonally, the ending of Hellsing 2001 did not work for me, unlike Hellsing Ultimate 2006, a similar situation as with the alchemists)\nHaving reviewed this masterpiece, I forgot some moments so much that it seems \"did I see this at all?\" And I want to say about the ending, I understood what a multi-move Major came up with, but another question arose why?Herlicard Hellsing, cutie)",
        "A very beautifully crafted show but the extreme graphic content may not be everyone's cup of tea.",
        "Generally I criticize everything while I watching but Hellsing OVA is an extremely exceptional situation. I was supposed to say this part or that part wasn't reasonable and I said as I was expected. But I didn't really care how many time they'd stayed alive and bullets didn't work on a normal vampire.Story is also good, It would be cuss, If I said this story was superficial. Story is also good and addictive.Images are perfect and also soundtracks. I recommend you to watch with Japanese dub. I was against this idea because I cant understand what they said. After watching with Japanese dub, I couldn't stand watching with English dub. Dubbing is really good and also crazy laugh of Alucard.After completing the all series(till the 8th episode), I felt desperate because I have to wait for months to watch 9th episode. I think this one explains how this show made me an addict.",
        "An ancient secret organization of knights fight vampires with the aid of a super-powerful ancient vampire and his newly created apprentice, against an army of Nazi vampires and ghouls with interference from the Vatican's secret militia What's not to like?!Hellsing Ultimate (aka Hellsing Ultimate OVA) is executed with extreme artistry and aesthetics, wonderful dialog, characters, mythos, animation, music and plot. It's very dark, very occult and extremely violent, with that strange anime cute-humor thrown in in small portions just to keep you going \"WTF\"?! Not a let-down for anyone who enjoys the genre, knows a bit about the occult and folk-fairy-horror like Lovecraft, Poe and even ancient Greek tales. Make no mistake, this is one of the absolute pearls of the genre - by genre I mean both Vampire and Anime. The main character Alucard is impressively bonkers and evil, while all the time being a tool of those who fight evil - keeps you guessing what his purpose is. All supporting cast from heroes to villains are wonderfully stereotyped in that Robert Rodriguez way that keeps it cool rather than campy. The artistic style is perhaps a matter of taste, but by no means cheap, bad, rushed or amateurish. The characters have long, slender bodies, snapshot stances and CGI is used occasionally to great effect. I really liked the exaggerated lines and perspectives, andthe \"speed lines\" used in battle. f I have any negative remarks, then maybe I could do without the cute interludes and the extremely long (yet by no means irrelevant) dialogs. The show could have been compressed a little, but I enjoyed every second none the less.",
        "Some great action scenes, some great characters. It's just hard watching sometimes due to the preaching in it, about every character waffled on endlessly. Some of the preaching sounded really silly in places....over the top for sure.",
        "I like dark themes and all that, but when it feels like a series is just throwing them into the story for the sake of having some edgy hard to watch scenes, it cheapens the viewing experience.This show is that in a nutshell.",
        "Hellsing Ultimate is basically a HD remaster of the original Hellsing 2001 featuring the same voice cast for the main characters and a couple new voice actors too they fleshed out the characters better than the original too.This Show has a lot of what i love gruesome dark brutal and bloody but the characters are funny when they wanna be but when it starts taking itself too seriously and the Villans monologue for what seems like the whole episode it was boring me to tears i want more gore and action good thing is tho what gore and action the first half of the series provided was great.First Half amazing second half a lot slower i prefer the original Hellsing 2001 but the visuals a beautiful in this and so is the audio 8.0 /10.0 Watch the original if you liked that you'll like this.",
        "I think my summary says all. Especially if i add i mostly despise anime-culture. At least Naruto, Death Note and the other meaningless and tasteless popular no-good waste of moneys anyway, with their really, beyond words pathetic \"OMG cosplay is my life and Kira is sooo hawt\" fan girls and even worse fan boys who are just like Alucard's nickname \"no life king\"....... Oh and before anyone questions it, i did watch those and a lot of others like Full Metal Alchemist and so out of curiosity and pure boredom, so i don't just say that, i actually really saw them and i still think so...So chew on my words all you fanatics and sentence me to eternal torment for it.For the reasonable people i continue and say Elfen Lied and Rozen Maiden were the only ones which entertained me, which made me feel emotions, think, etc, everything what a good piece of art shall do. And oh yeah i liked the old Hellsing. I am not really into mangas, kangas and those sort of Japanese things, I was and am a real comic-book fan, and by comic-books i mean Batman, Sin City, Hellboy, Constantine and sort. For me a good character, a clever plot, and a REAL fight for example between Joker and Batman is more exciting than the average \"we look into each others eyes for 20 minutes than we shout meaningless things and insults toward each other for another 20, then we fight for a., 1 minute (like most of the fights in the original hellsing and in this one too, i must admit), b., for an eternity(dragon ball anyone?)\". And i could never get over the \"we sacrifice everything, EVERYTHING just to look stylish and cool\" attitude either. Which Hellsing Ultimate does too...So why i love this so much? I don't know. Honestly. And i think this is the best compliment i can give. This is even better then the old hellsing series was. This is so breath-takingly amazing, every scene, every word is believable, likable, you can almost imagine them as real people around you. Especially Seras Victoria and Pip Bernadotte. Their romance is the perfect example to show what i mean: It is so smooth, it never makes a big deal about itself, its not rousing but arousing, its so delicate and yet it explodes with such fierceness and emotions in episode 7, that i dare to call it the most touching thing I might ever will see in my life. The whole scene is so unearthly bloody and violent and still it is more kind and gentle then 99% of the chick-flicks you see. Why? Because it is real. It feels real anyway, in that moment you really believe that the mercenary-captain is glad the way he dies, protecting a sweet girl, and you feel the pain of Seras, you see the hatred and the anger rise within her, which leads to her decision to finally drink blood, which is a thing she was afraid to do, because she thought she will lose her humanity, but right now you see and understand why she does it.All characters are obsessed, not black and not white, but all different depths of gray. Even the craziest and most evil Major has his soft moments when he jokes around with Schr\u00f6dinger about him being fat, or when she praises and salutes for Rip Van Winkle, and also Integra can be an ignorant, violent fool driven by her hatred and anger (for example when she orders Alucard to massacre in episode 3) I rambled too much already so i close this review now, with the conclusion: Even if you are an avid hater of animes or a real fan, this is beyond that argument. This is beyond the question, what it is, because the answer is really simple: pure genius ART, intentionally with all big letters.",
        "I didn't really like the first one because I don't really like shows that don't follow the manga but this remake is one of the best I've ever watched. It follows the manga with its bloody animation. Recommend watching it.",
        "Ten years ago, young Integra Hellsing ascends to the head of the Hellsing Organization after the death of her father Arthur. Her jealous uncle Richard Hellsing attempts to kill her, but in doing so awakens a dormant Alucard, who proceeds to kill Richard's men. It is Integra who shoots and kills her uncle, thereby becoming the last descendant of the Hellsing bloodline. Alucard declares his allegiance to Integra and becomes her loyal servant. In present day England, Alucard is called to duty to eradicate a vampire priest and his ghouls. However, a police girl named Seras Victoria is gravely injured in the process, and upon giving her a choice to live or die, Alucard turns her into his vampire servant. Later, on a mission to hunt down a vampire in the town of Badrick in Northern Ireland, Alucard meets and fights Father Alexander Anderson for the first time. the characters in this show are very humours and i did find my self laughing a lot there is a lot of blood and guts in this so it's not for the faint hearted the voicing and the animation were brilliant",
        "I keep reading that this is a faithful retelling of the manga, that may be true but I don't know because I'm not a manga reader. Maybe people are rating it based on how close it is to the manga, but as a stand alone anime, it's rated too high. What I can say is that it has good elements but it also has a lot of flaws. Without giving away spoilers I'll tell you that the pacing is way too long in certain areas and too short in others. Some characters you like are given barely any backstory and characters you don't really care about are given a lot. The character relationships developed between each other feel rushed and therefore it throws off the story. The comedy takes away from the vibe of the whole show and should have just been done away with entirely. Some parts of the show seem totally unrealistic (yes, even for an anime). Now all that being said, I like the main characters (mostly) and the darkness, action, gore, and plot. 6/10.",
        "A more 'edgy' version of the original series that drags on, and on, and on. The action is at best adequate and cannot offset the tedious, contrived plot, glacial pacing, and complete lack of any storytelling ability. The original series, despite the sometimes shoddy animation, at least had a bit of style about, together with significantly better music throughout and the ability to string a coherent story together. Ultimate is apparently a better rendition of the manga but, if the series is any guide, the author of the manga has nothing much to say. If you liked the original just rewatch that and be done with it.",
        "I haven't read the original manga or seen the OVA but I had been led to believe the abridged version was hilarious, so I watched it...I did find it was above board on the humour but the voice acting was terrible, which mad me want to see what the main fuss was about, and it led me to this.The story, dialogue, voice acting, overall design and artwork is exceptional and really sucks you in (no pun intended), at least it does until you get some random chibi childish overhyped cartoon clip thrown into the mix and you're cast out of the immersion completely.I can't recommend this enough to people wanting an alternative, and somewhat more violent* take on the Dracula tale and then some. If you can get past the chibi (Who thought that would be a good idea?!) madness then it's a keeper.____________________________\n*That doesn't sound like much regarding the traditional take on Vlad III's iconic history but this goes well beyond that."

        "I was going to watch this anime throughout the year but since it is the Christmas holidays, I finally got to watch it rather then skip it. Damn I gotta say the English Dub actors were on point and all the characters were pretty likeable!Although this anime is not one of my favourites, I still definitely recommend it if you want to try out other anime you haven't watched before. The fighting scenes were pretty great if you ask me and this is regardless if it was 2008!Check it out folks!",
        "Within a school known as the DWMA which made to teach students, or should I say weapons and misters who have special abilities to transform into weapons. The story resolves around 3 duos Maka (and her weapon soul), Black Star (and his partner tsubaki) and Lord Death's son himself Death the kid (and his weapons the Thompson sisters). They all of a task of collecting 99 souls of Keishens and 1 which so they can get the ranking of a death scythe. However, forces from outside of the academy cause more problems for our trios as this is causing trouble around the world.I really enjoyed watch this series and the premise it had to offer. While it took me nearly three years to finish it due to my busy schedule around the time, but it was all worth it. While I do agree the ending probably was rush as it is missing some elements from the manga, but I still enjoyed it.It really unique animation which almost resembles to western cartoons that aired on TV around the time when this aired. The art style also has a good flow with the character designs.The intros are really welcoming whenever I start an episode and the endings is also excellent. My personal favourites are the second intro and ending.The dub is excellent with a stellar casting including Laura Bailey, Micah Solousod, Chuck Huber, Vic Mignonga, John Swasey, Kent Williams, Maxey Whitehead, Jamie Marchi, Chermai Leigh, Todd Haberkorn, Monica Rial and many others. The only voice I didn't really like was Black Star who sounded very forced and a bit feminine as well as ear grating. Please don't listen to any dub haters if they are any in the reviews, those people just love to ruin anime for others.Soul Eater gets a 10/10.",
        "The setting of \u00bbSoul Eater\u00ab is Shibusen University, whose students are so-called masters (Shokunin in the original). Each of them has some kind of living weapon as a partner and they all aim to make their weapon into a Death Scythe by scavenging the souls of evil people. But this is more of a motivational aid, because the real goal of the university is to prevent these souls from falling into the wrong hands - in the worst case into someone who is trying to use them to create a kishin, a kind of demon god. The anime now follows the adventures of the masters Maka, Black Star and Death the Kid with their respective partners Soul Eater, Tsubaki, Patty and Liz, all of whom are more or less seriously trying to save the world from its doom.\"Soul Eater\" has a very interesting basic structure, but in the end it didn't really convince me.I don't know exactly what it was.The characters are well written, the animations are nice, and so are the fights, but something just didn't grab me.",
        "Well this show is pretty freaking amazing. Out of 51 episodes, I only disliked 5 of them. That's a pretty good ratio if you ask me. Soul Eater's enjoyment came from its rather humorous take on things and its characters, more so the characters. Most of them I really loved (not all of them), like Soul, Maka, Death the Kid, Crona, Medusa, and Lord Death. All of these characters are awesome in their own right. Soul, Maka, and Death the Kid I like because they're great at what they do, which is fighting. Lord Death I like because he can beat the crap out of anybody and still be absolutely hilarious at the same time. I liked Crona because the show made feel sympathetic towards the poor kid, which is easier said than done. Usually I would hate a character like Crona because they get my nerves, but they found a way for me to actually care about him. Lastly Medusa is awesome because I don't think I've ever wanted a villain to die so bad. She is more than just a bad guy who only exists to fight the protagonists. She's cunning, sly, sadistic, smart, utterly despicable, and a truly awesome villain. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't love every character. Tsubaki, Liz, Patty, and Dr. Stein were all fine, they just really have anything special about them, at least not to me. The only character I flat out disliked was Black Star. His cockiness annoyed me to no end and I just wanted to punch him in the face. Other than him, pretty great characters all around. The plot is fairly engaging as well. (I'm not going super deep into this, so no spoilers.) It starts of with the 3 pairs (Soul and Maka, Black Star and Tsubaki, and Death the Kid and Liz and Patty) going on various missions for the DWMA in order for each pairs' weapon to become a Death Scythe. However, after Medusa releases the evil Kishin Asura, all our characters have to put all their efforts into stopping him. It's a fun, action packed story line, so no complaints there. That really concludes all the positives about this show, but there are some negatives. I've already mentioned Black Star, so no need to go through that again. I really did not like the first 3 episodes. Each one follows a different pair and they serve as an introductory to everyone. The problem is they overemphasize each characters idiosyncrasies. Soul wants to be the coolest, Black Star wants to be better than everyone, and Death the Kid is in love with symmetry. They bash you over the head with those qualities way too much in those episodes for them to be enjoyable. Thankfully, they toned down those characteristics later on. The other 2 episodes I didn't like were the ones that revolved around The Holy Sword Excalibur. All that takes place in these episodes is Excalibur talking about his past in an extremely annoying fashion. He's never important throughout the entire show! Why does he get 2 whole episodes to himself? Did Blair get her own episode? No! So why should he? Anyway those episodes felt very, very out of place and I hated them. Another thing I didn't like about this show was its' refusal to kill of anyone major. It isn't a huge problem and it doesn't really bother me that much, but it would have added some more emotion to the show. Lastly, I didn't like the ending. *SPOILERS* The way Maka killed Asura felt really cheap and stupid. All you needed to beat him was to be brave? Wasn't everyone who fought him brave? I would assume so. So why didn't they kill him? I don't know, but I would like to know. Even if ignore that, I wanted a huge epic battle. It wasn't really and I would have preferred it that way. It sounds like all these negatives make the show bad, but trust me they don't. All the positives crush the negatives, making this one of my favorite anime. 9/10",
        "Soul Eater is an anime series that beautifully blends supernatural action, comedy, and a touch of darkness to create an exhilarating and unique viewing experience. Set in the mysterious Death City, the story follows a group of students who attend the Death Weapon Meister Academy, where they train to become skilled warriors by pairing up with living weapons known as \"Demon Weapons.\"One of the strongest aspects of Soul Eater is its captivating and imaginative world-building. The show takes place in a universe where humans and supernatural beings coexist, and it seamlessly combines elements of horror, fantasy, and mythology. From the intricately designed characters to the elaborate settings, each aspect of the show's universe feels thoughtfully crafted, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in its rich and vibrant atmosphere.The characters in Soul Eater are a true highlight, each possessing their own quirks, motivations, and distinct personalities. The main trio-Maka Albarn, Black Star, and Death the Kid-serve as compelling protagonists, with their unique weapon partners adding an extra layer of complexity to their dynamics. Additionally, the supporting cast is equally memorable, featuring a diverse range of fascinating characters who contribute to the story's depth and entertainment value.The animation in Soul Eater is stylish and visually stunning. The action sequences are fluid, intense, and packed with dynamic movements that keep you on the edge of your seat. The show's distinctive art style, characterized by bold and exaggerated character designs, perfectly complements the darker themes and supernatural elements of the series. The attention to detail in the animation, particularly during battle scenes and transformations, is truly impressive and adds an extra layer of excitement to the viewing experience.The narrative of Soul Eater is engaging, filled with mystery, and often takes unexpected twists and turns. It successfully balances lighthearted comedic moments with darker and more serious themes, creating a unique tonal blend. The plot steadily builds up suspense and intrigue, culminating in thrilling battles and confrontations that keep viewers hooked until the very end.While Soul Eater offers a highly enjoyable and satisfying viewing experience, it does have a few shortcomings. Some viewers may find the pacing a bit uneven, with occasional slower moments that don't quite match the intensity of the rest of the series. Additionally, the ending, while satisfying in many ways, may leave some longing for more resolution and closure.Despite these minor flaws, Soul Eater remains a standout anime that expertly combines supernatural action, comedy, and compelling characters. With its captivating world, stunning animation, and a story that keeps you invested, Soul Eater is a must-watch for fans of the genre. Whether you're new to anime or a seasoned viewer, this series is sure to entertain and leave you craving for more adventures in the extraordinary world of the Death Weapon Meister Academy.",
        "The storyline is different because the weapons eat souls to become a death scythe or weapon for Death. Death and his office are funny the way they are drawn. The other thing I like are the weapons the meisters use are human and transform at a moments notice. Death the Kid is funny because everything has to be symmetrical and he will continue to obsess over it if he thinks it is not.The graphics are cheesy sometimes, especially with buildings and towns. I would like to know what they were thinking when making the sun/moon because they are just creepy. The weapons and the meisters remind me of a zanpakto and the soul reaper. Soul reminds me of Ichigo Kurosaki and his laid back attitude. Black Star reminds me of Natsu Dragneel and how he acts before thinking, but also has the weapons of Shuehei from Bleach. The Kid reminds of Byakuya Kuchiki in matters of perfection. It is a decent show, but needs to be its' own without reminders of other anime.",
        "So! I love this show, I have since I was a kid! When they first did this anime they manga wasn't finished. And honestly they did it before it's time. With way they can create anime now, now is the time to do this story justice! And with them just finishing up fire force, it's definitely the time!It's a must watch either way.I'm a hopeless romantic so my heart will always crave maka and soul ending up together but the creator has said before that's not how he sees it and it's not his style. So I digress. Still so worth the watch!",
        "Excellent Anime\nwhen i start watching this anime. I thought its good anime\nbut now im sure its EXCELLENT ANIME\n& its Funny too :)",
        "I've seen a lot of anime over the years and this one is defnietly one of the more unique and interesting ones of our time. The premise are a group of kids in a dark fantasy world learning to become Weapon Meisters in an effort to save the world against ancient evil that is consuming their world. It has a fun cast of characters with their own unique personalities and style that you can't help but root for them and want to see more of their adventures.The animation and art style is very creative, with a lot of the visuals feeling like they were heavily inspired by Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas. The comedy is hit or miss but is pleasantly made up for by the strong character interactions and animation. One are I felt it somewhat lacked in was that the finale I felt was a little abrupt and underwhelming but I believe part of that may have been because of some of the alterations to the story that differed from the OG Manga. All in all, Soul Eater is a wholesome experience that any fan of dark fantasy and anime should watch.",
        "If you're a fan of shonen, but it executed right with a banging soundtrack, fun characters, and a unique weapons system.Then this is for you, it also packs emotional punches and realistic relationships.If all those sound appealing, please give it a watch.",
        "It's one of those TV series date you got to watch and find your own curiosities and your own thoughts on it but I do say watch it it is good",
        "This is a fun one that I saw long before... I liked it. Maybe ranked at a 7.5 then. But I found myself binging FIREFORCE and realized it was made by the same people.... the Easter eggs in FOREFORCE made my daughter and I rewatch soul eater and wow.I watch a lot of anime. Lived in Japan since 2003. Watching it now I now see how ahead of it's time it was. It will be a classic for sure. The fight scenes, the humor, the characters good or bad. I can see some newer anime's even borrowed from it.I don't want to spoil anything but give it a try. It went from a 7.5 then to a 9 now. Not a ten because there are some dead spots and it doesn't end the way many expected. Still great though.Sun and moon tattoo here I come\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe\nHave a great day!",
        "I first watched and loved Soul Eater, my first shonen anime, as a teen, and have been coming back at it out of pure nostalgia. Here's my impression as an adult: In a universe in which some persons can transform to weapons, Death himself has created an Academy where Meisters and Weapons team up to learn to fight evil and madness. This is the setting for a wild ride full of electric action scenes, creepy enemies and slapstick comedy.The teenage cast fulfills the clich\u00e9s of the shonen genre: there's the ambitious, hard-working girl, the pretentious idiot, the too cool for school-kid, etc. In a sense they are all very caricatural and over the top, but so unashamedly and stubbornly so that I quickly grew fond of everyone. There's also a whole set of secondary adult characters that I really like, and even the villains hold a special place in my heart. All characters have very strong personalities, which are reinforced by the stellar voice acting (of the Japanese version) and by the great character designs.The animation is colorful and vibrant (although gloomy and gore at times), with very interesting hallucinatory sequences when Madness strikes, and a lot of signature notes that just scream \"Soul Eater!\". The music has a very cool flair, never pushing itself to the foreground but always adding the special touch.This show is clearly aimed at a (presumably male) teenage audience, and the humor is often way too childish for my taste. But it also sometimes indulges in totally absurd humor I found uproariously funny (especially the Excalibur \"troll episodes\"), but then that's my personal taste. There's also a lot of clich\u00e9s in the narration. But you can overlook this flaws in part thanks to darker themes like madness v.s. order, progress v.s stability, and in part because of the compelling character dynamics.Because it's the intensity of the relationships between the main pairings of the cast (usually Meister and Weapon) that make me go fan-girl over it. There's no romance, but deep friendship and such amounts of mutual trust and loyalty that it makes for deeply human and relatable relationships.So if you can generously overlook the pubescent humor and the clich\u00e9s in the storyline, and can warm up to energetic and goofy teenagers fighting Demons with cool weapons, give Soul Eater a try. It most certainly has a lot of feelings and joy to share with its audience.",
        "SOUL EATER is possibly one of the most original anime's I've ever seen! Not just in story telling but art design too! Most animes all have the exact same looking art style. Soul Eater on the other hand, goes for a almost punk looking art style that you'd find with GORILLAZ! This anime also (strangely enough) has a very Tim Burton feel to it (and I'm a HUGE fan of Tim Burton), a lot like The Nightmare Before Christmas! At the time of making this review I've only watched the first episode and am thoroughly looking forward to the rest of the series! Soul is a very cool character and the only gripe I found was: WHY DID THEY GIVE BLACK STAR A FEMALES VOICE?! AND IT'S SO OBVIOUS IT'S A FEMALE!But apart from that, I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series!5/510/10",
        "It's okay. The plot isn't riveting but you'll have fun enjoying the character interactions and humor. The fan service isn't my favorite. Dropped it around episode 17 because I just wasn't hooked. Slow plot, but decent show.",
        "The first time I watched Soul Eater I honestly liked it, however later on in the series I couldn't stand it. I will admit the critical reasons I didn't adore it are unreasonable so we'll put those aside. This anime has a very unique sense of animation, the dub is fine, and the theme song is great. The characters, though, are very quirky. Which is enjoyable honestly, you can't find too many characters like them. But like unlike other animes, this one disappointed me (will get to that later) It was very different, in many ways, for example it's comedy, it's characters, and it's storytelling. Throughout the series, however, I did not bond with any character like I do with at least one of every animes I watch. There not a lot of reasoning to why, they just didn't seem relatable. Yes, the characters are funny but it's hard to click with them. The ending is very unsatisfactory, in all honestly I wanted more but I didn't really want to read the manga. It's odd, I don't really how to explain maybe it's just me. Beside the fact, it's a good watch. The appropriate age range would be maybe 12 or for mature kids 10. It's dark but not too dark. In conclusion, I respect Soul Eater. It goes a different route than other anime and gives out a risky animation style. But besides it's dark humor, the story is pretty typical. Which is the main reason why this anime disappointed me.",
        "Having seen all 51 episodes I can safely say this anime was really bad. Now I'm a fan of silly anime with a good story (Yu Yu Hakusho, Sailor Moon, One Piece). This anime had the silly part down, but it's story was lame.The series has several episodes that either drag out or just plain get nothing accomplished (I'm talking about the ones with Excalibur, ugh). The few that do try to blend humor with dark gritty storytelling (I bet they were thinking, hey it worked for One Piece, we'll do it here too) and it just doesn't fit. The characters are flat stereotypes: Maka is a typical loudmouth brainiac, Black Star's Naruto 2.0, and Death the Kid is the emo pretty boy. The weapons are all tropes and the villains are hammy knock offs of superior villains. The story is starts good, but wanders off into nonsense once the whole black blood bullcrap is introduced and it condescends into wannabe Disney idiocy.So if you haven't seen Soul Eater, don't bother. There are a butt ton of anime that far surpass this garbage.",
        "This show is by far one of the most underrated anime 10/10 must watch, most definitely on my top 5 anime.",
        "My children ADORE this. It is a bit violent, but nothing that hasn't been in other movies (Transformers, Iron Man...) that are based on American comic books. As you can tell which character makes me both cringe and giggle, we'll jump right into the review!The anime focuses on 3 groups of students. We have Maka, the daughter of a particularly strong death scythe and Lord Death's weapon and the scythe's creator the meister. We have her weapon, Soul Eater (or just Soul). Soul is a atypical mouthy kid in typical anime style and reminds me of every thirteen year old I've met, including my own. The second pair is a Naruto clone character named Blackstar that believes he is the best meister in the world and #1, even when he's collected NO souls, and his poor abused weapon Tsubaki. She is an amazing if quiet character but we do get to see why and it's a nice descent into flashback and character development. The last is an OCD child of Lord Death (Death was married?) named aptly Kid Death. Because symmetry is a HUGE fanatical part of his brain, this Grim Reaper/meister must have two firearms named Liz and Patty Thompson. One reoccurring bit of humor is that the two firearms are sisters but not twins (he harps on the difference in breast size; logical for the directed audience of the show).All these people are students at Death Meister Academy (forgive me if I missed a word). Lord Death, Sid (a teacher), and later a rather intriguing teacher Stein all teach the \"kids\" how to work as a team harmonizing their souls to work in tandem.Enemies begin small, such as an amazing 2d character Blair that makes me laugh all the same, to dark and truly evil witches that want to destroy the word. As we progress through the series, it gets darker and looks hopeless--at one point I recall asking, how many episodes are left? They can't do this HERE in the season!--and yet, the kids don't give up.Comic relief is constant in the series, but then again what series doesn't have it? Even Alan (D-Greyman) had it. If it's not Blackstar's constant assurance that He's The Greatest, then it's Excalibur admonishing \"Fool!\" looking like a cross between a penguin, an umbrella, and an armadillo (as my daughter says he resembles the latter). Even a love affair with a toilet is thrown in mid-season. The moon and sun are being used as a typical design (Alan has the same moon).I highly recommend this series. It *is* dark, and I would watch it with younger children so they do understand concepts explored--or for the few hints of sexuality tossed in the mix (such as a pair of bikini underwear given improperly to a young lady!)--to make sure all remains well. It will remain a family favorite for a LONG time to come.D.",
        "I love this anime So much and I wish theyre were more seasons! This show is my life and I suggest it!",
        "Im not a seasoned anime pro, i have seen like 3-4 series so far. Soul Eater is my latest discovery, and i must say I'm glad i found it.Usually a fan of refined, state-of-the-art-graphics stuff such as Ghost In The Shell, Soul Eaters style didn't catch me from the first second. But having decided to give it a try anyway, i found out that this complete graphical madness somehow has reason to it. It emphasizes (with arrows! :) ) only the most important, almost childishly drawing out the obvious. Which is actually quite original, plus you get surprised a lot by the changing style.Story is deep enough and has just enough background to tie the episodes together, yet always having a new twist. As childish as it is, it doesn't really feel like meant for kids - reminding me Harry Potter for that matter. Maybe its just me, but i found some other similarities with Harry Potter stories there..All in all, Soul Eater is a series worth watching for every anime fan for its original style.",
        "Watch this anime if you have time!The story is about a group of students who are in a school called 'Shibushen' who try to maintain peace by suppress the evil activities of the witches and other evil beings.The anime was quite thrilling to watch. There were twists and jokes, which seemed too childish to start with but you get attached to them and start to enjoy it. 'Patty' one of the characters makes you smile every-time she shows up. Each character is obsessed with one thing or another. What I liked about this anime is that they kept it short and tried to stick to the story. There are a couple of fillers(one or two) but I shouldn't really call them that.To be more critical about the anime I would say its for teens. The animation is quite childish, The moon, the sun, the school to start with. There isn't much of detailing on every character which i think would give it a better feel. I loved the journey of 'Soul Eater', but the destination just disappointed me! Things happen all of a sudden at times, you take time to understand whats really going on.Many a times you will be like 'What the hell just happened?' I would say watch it if you have nothing else to go for, it might just do the trick to entertain you!I would give it 7.5/10",
        "Great animation clean art intresting story fun charectors so you may be asking whats the issueBack in 2008-9 if a anime got up to the manga one of 2 things would happen.1. The show has filler made for it untill it has more manga to go off of (bleach, naruto)2. It would just end on a cliff hanger(this still happens alot today)3. The show has a anime only endimgmade for it (fma 2003)",
        "I started watching bc it seemed original and i also liked the artstyle.. but to be honest, its pretty boring, its always the same: they r going to fight a powerful villain, then they act goofy and that annoying kid, black star appears, mess ups everything, but somehow they win.Also i hate fanservice and the stupid faces they make every 5 seconds.",
        "This show is truly amazing it has great characters. The Story is original and completely amazing. Another thing that makes this to my favorite show is the villains are just amazing Arusa , Eruka ,Free, Arachne and then their is Medusa who is by far one of the greatest villains ever made. I can find no flaws with Medusa she is just perfect she even has the perfect voice. One scene in particular that makes her great is the scene where she posses the child's body that scene always send shivers up my spine every time i see it. The show changes from light a comical to dark and gritty giving a great shift in narrative. As i said before the plot of the show is completely original. Not only is it Original though it is excellent the ideas in this show draw you in it makes you think about law order and sanity. The animation in the show is some of the best i have ever seen it always amazes me when i am watch the show. The show always keeps you in a state of suspense. Probily one of the best parts of the show is when the madness starts to take over Dr. Stein. This show desires a 20/10 unfortunately i could not rate it that high is i give it a 10/10"

        "Set in a world where people are preyed on by monsters known as Yoma; Raki finds himself cast out from his town after his family is killed. He ends up in the company of Clare; the woman who killed the Yoma that killed his parents. Clare isn't a normal person; she is a Claymore; a half human, half Yoma fighter. The Claymore are the only people capable of killing Yoma but they are distrusted by humanity because of their Yoma halves. As the series progresses we see Clare battling various Yoma before a series of flashback episodes show how Clare came to be a Claymore. We also learn that there is something far more dangerous than the Yoma; Awakened Beings\u0085 these are Claymore who have used too much of their Yoma power, have lost control and can't revert to their human form.If you like action packed anime with interesting characters then you could do a lot worse than this. I really liked how the whole mythology of the Claymores was explained and thought Clare and Raki were great protagonists. The characters were well designed so that the Claymores looked distinctive despite them all being fair-haired and silver-eyed. The story progressed nicely although the final fight between the Claymores and the Awakened Beings did go on a bit too long and the constant inner monologues where characters reminded us of their motivations were a bit of a distraction. The action is animated in an exciting way and is often quite bloody so this probably isn't suitable for younger viewers. Overall I'd say that this series is well worth watching.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "Claymore is a complex and action packed anime. Claymore are a series of warriors that are half human/half yoma (demons) that must protect humanity from yoma, even though humans are very wary and fear the Claymore. Run by a mysterious organisation, the subject of the series is Clare, the lowest ranked Claymore of all. Over the course of the series we find out why she became a Claymore, her troubled past, and look at the relationship she develops with a young boy that wishes to stay with her. Throughout the series we meet a number of different characters and the events lead to a dramatic conclusion.The animation is gorgeous, focusing on darker and paler colours. The whites, silvers and greys create an unforgiving world where these monsters and warriors could easily exist. Clare is a fascinating character, as are most of the Claymores as they must avoid using too much power lest they turn into the very demons they fight. The world that Claymore is set in becomes very complex, and a lot of the rules seem to be made up just in the nick of time to save our protagonists.The biggest problem for me is something I find in a lot of animes, and that is constant dialogue that explains everything. We hear about character motivations, characters' interpretations of other people's motivations, why they are doing certain things etc. etc. Even when in the middle of a huge battle, characters will prattle on. Luckily the characters do keep ones attention, even if it was hard to tell the difference between the Claymore as they all have the same colour hair, costumes, and eyes. The action hits at a blistering pace, with some really painful gore.I did find it hard to concentrate on the last few episodes, because it just kept flashing back and after everything it just seemed as though people wussed out in order to push forward a second season that never happened. But if you like monsters, big swords, and large mythical tales, Claymore could be for you.",
        "Its an old anime from 2007, not consider as classic yet the animation quality seems to be low but it doesnt stopped me from binge watching the whole series. Can be categorised as action, horror and adventure. Its a fast paced short series, ideal for quick watch. Story wise nothing extraordinary, just a generic demon/monster hunting storylines depicted by various other animes but trust me stick for a while, it would gets better (literally cried on episode 8). The action scenes get better as well. Tbh, most of the claymores look exactly same ( barely spot any differences except for their voice casting, but it doesnt matter as most of them only had short screening time)Both opening and ending songs were mediocre. Big fan of the hand drawn animation style. The quality of the audio/sound scores were low, hence cheap production. Great characters development arc in this anime. Packed with violence, so not ideal for children. Would like to venture more in this world. Great closure for season 1 and i believe the show was cancelled afterwards, so no season 2 - too bad. I was really looking forward for clare to kill priscilla.... what a bummer. Highly Recommended.",
        "For the first five or six episodes I was hooked on this show. The story was really good, the pacing was great, and it seems like everything was going to go well and that fish series may end up being amongst my favorites, but the ending is where it instead became one of my most hated.I'm sure that if you're watching this series you may have read it in Shonen Jump as a kid, like I did, and expected it to be gritty, dark and great, which it was up until the end. If you were also alive during the boom of anime in North America in the early 2000s you may have also seen the first Dragon Ball Z Broly movie and remembered the annoying part at the end we're Goku keeps on screaming at the top of his lungs \" more power. I need more power. Give me more power!\" In that context it was fine because it was a very short scene, but when you stretch a scene like that out for four whole episodes it can really become a bummer.The ending fight between Claire and the Wolf demon guy, whatever his name was, was really dull and boring until she finally defeated him, and then there's the Edition that Raki stumbled across Priscilla and Isley of the North, and seemingly befriends them, which could have been an amazing confrontation especially if Priscilla and Isley both decided to take Raki prisoner or even killed him, something other than just letting him go so that it could build up to this lackluster, and terrible ending.I'm going to go ahead and spoil it for you oh, so be warned. The ending of the show is Claire versus Priscilla, she annoyingly says the entire fight, once again \" more power. I need more power. Give me more power.\" And again her Yoma or a flares and she partially awakens, to Priscilla surprised she is just about to defeat her when Raki jumps in and tells Claire to not kill Priscilla. That to kill her would make her know better than the Yoma that she hunts and kills. An age-old debacle about forgiving the person that you hate the most, which could have been pulled off much better, but instead was cheaply done, we lost Jean who saves Claire by having her sync up with her Yoma aura killing her in the process. What a shame.This whole series was full of great scenes of pride, and even some emotion, which I honestly didn't expect from this series, but it all led up to one of the most lackluster endings to any anime that I've ever seen. The dialogue was horrible, at that point I just wanted it to end because it was so bad. It was nothing like the previous episodes, it was like somebody else took over who I had never read, or even talked with the original writers of the first couple episodes and just did their own thing. It was on par with the Netflix Godzilla movies, both of these series ended up being great building up, but by the end you just wanted them to end and you hated them.I honestly would not recommend this series, you should probably watch just the first six episodes and stop there, but you won't be able to since the story is actually pretty good up until the end. The ending is where it ends up, no pun intended, going from good to bad. Would not watch again",
        "At first I didn't like anime or manga I thought it was just another normal anime if the plot and the end of the first episodes were average some I liked and some I didn't\nClaymore has a lot of bad things as well as good thingsgood think about claymore is the greatest plot:The story follows a young Claymore named Clare, who takes on dangerous assignments to protect humans from Yoma. As she embarks on her journey, she encounters various allies and adversaries, uncovering dark secrets about the organization that created herWhat else I liked about the series is Claye's past:Clare's past is tragic and marked by intense suffering. As a child, she lived in a village terrorized by Yoma, shape-shifting monsters that preyed on humans. One day, a powerful Yoma attacked Clare's village, killing her parents and devastating her life. She was left alone and defenseless until a Claymore warrior named Teresa arrived to eliminate the Yoma Teresa, a compassionate and powerful Claymore, took pity on Clare and decided to spare her life. Instead of killing her, Teresa chose to raise Clare as her own and train her to become a Claymore. Under Teresa's guidance, Clare learned the ways of a warrior and honed her combat skills, gradually becoming stronger However, tragedy struck again when Teresa confronted a group of powerful Awakened Beings-former Claymores who had fully succumbed to their Yoma powers. Despite Teresa's strength, she was ultimately overpowered and killed by the Awakened Beings. Before her death, Teresa entrusted Clare with her unfinished mission: to find the \"Black Card\" and seek revenge against the Awakened Beings The plot of claymore explores themes of identity, loss, and the struggle between humanity and monstrositybad think about claymore is the unresolved Plot Threads:One unresolved plot thread in Claymore is the fate of the Organization and their ultimate agenda. Throughout the series, it becomes apparent that the Organization has its own hidden motives and manipulates the Claymores for their own purposes. They conduct secret experiments, control the ranking system, and enforce strict rules and protocols However, the true extent of the organization's plans and goals are never fully revealed or resolved. The series ends with absolutely no explanation as to their ultimate goal or the long-term consequences of their actioni think claymore its not bad manga and anime but there are problems in the anime and the mangaclaymore anime:(6/10)\nclaymore manga:(7/10)",
        "The first thing you'll notice immediately about this show is that it looks and feels pretty dated. You can tell it came out in the mid to late 2000's. You can especially see it in the edgy style, the animations and the way they use certain editing techniques. It's not a bad thing, but it's definitely noticeable. The other thing is the way they drew the lips on the characters. Why does the upper lip protrude so much over the bottom one? It looks weird man! Lol. The body proportions are pretty ridiculous as well. My gripe with this show is that it felt rushed, especially towards the end. It felt like they introduced all these characters and lore and didn't give enough time for these things to breath and be explained. I was pretty disappointed with the way things unfolded at the end. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. The ending of this anime suffered similarly to the ending of GOT. It kind of leaves it open for a 2nd season, but they never went through with it. So it kind of finishes with a lack of closure.The art style is sick. It has a dark fantasy vibe similar to Berserk. The world and the setting are awesome - it's got sort of Skyrim vibes. It takes place around sometime during the medieval era in a fictional world where monsters called, Yoma's, kill and feed on people. It's a brutal and unforgiving world where people are constantly losing loved ones. Thankfully, there's these half-human half-monster warriors called Claymores who go around fighting and killing the Yoma that terrorize the land. What makes the show interesting is the mystery that it's shrouded in. They only give us just enough information to know what's going on, so we end up having more questions than answers. We don't know much about the Organization or how it was formed or how the Claymore's came to be. The storytelling is great and the premise is intriguing. The way the plot progresses makes for a very entertaining watch. The characters are very interesting - they basically make the show more engaging. Once Teresa comes into the picture, things start to get more interesting. Teresa and Clare's backstory was the highlight of the show. It was so shocking and out of nowhere what Priscilla did to Teresa. That was so grimy. Talk about suppressing your inner darkest demons - Priscilla went full Yoma god mode. That whole scene was pretty horrifying to say the least. The show got dark really quick. But wow, what an amazing and brilliant way to setup Clare's origin story. So frickin good man. It made me root for Clare the whole time. I wanted to see her succeed so bad, especially after finding out that she's the lowest rank in the continent. Ophelia is just a straight up sadomasochist psycho. I like how Ilena bumped into Clare's life again. What she did for Clare was amazing and completely selfless.The fights are sick. The music and soundtrack are solid. The voice acting is great. The dialogue can be kind of redundant at times especially when they narrate what just happened. Parts of the show come off kind of silly and ridiculous but it fits the show somehow and doesn't take away from it. The clanking of the Claymores' metal boots reminds me of cowboys with their spurs. All the cracking and squishing noises in the show are unsettling. There's this sense of uneasiness throughout the show that I found interesting. All the lore tied to the world is fantastic.It can get pretty dark, disturbing, violent and gory. But at the core of this anime lies a very human heart. This show explores how humans who are considered to be monsters can care for humans and be more human than their monster counterpart. It's essentially about how beautiful and empathetical humans can be regardless of how monstrous they can become. I couldn't help but feel bad for the Claymore women. They're shunned by humans, isolated from society and are basically lone wolves who's only purpose is to kill Yoma's. They know no love, they don't have any family or friends to share feelings or emotions with and they're treated as if they're not human. What's even more perplexing is how beautiful these women are. It's an anime that explores themes of morality, identity, freedom of choice and the human condition. The show is honestly so good that the episodes fly by without even noticing. Even though the ending was pretty disappointing, it's an awesome show and a great revenge story.",
        "Years ago, this series immediately turned me off when i noticed that all the lead female characters were unneccessarily-blonde, perhaps there was a reason in the plot/setting, but that-was-that, a superficial annoyance turning me off,\ni chose something else to watch, and moved on - anime being the smorgasboard it is,---Now that i've actually watched it, as the series has progressed, some of the effort put into the methods particularly, of the monsters versus the rather stale & near-homogenous heroines, kept me interested,when i might've otherwise got sick of the repetitous competitive-aggression vs. Disciple theme amongst the heroines , which although parallel to the conflict, limits how diverse the 'good-guys' ARE,which indirectly makes them LESS-interesting than the monsters (plus a few other more diverse characters like the shadowy leader/liason of the org that's constantly giving orders),And-then, because the monsters are usually / mostly disposable characters, the lack of diversity remains and the limited culture if that's not too much of a word for it, amongst the org. Doesn't change or adapt all that much, and there seems to be an obvious abscence of non-Claymore powers of the (100%)humans themselves, aiding, working parallel, or even at times, competing-with the Claymores, in their OWN defence.That simplification of the 'settled'-balance of relied-upon power in the setting, limits what-happens in each episode, as-well-as who gets involved in the ending,so while there isn't too much to have to think about, if intrigue bores you, especially if still-frame + opening&closing mouths visuals bore you, and the series DOES do a reasonable job of making sure there's enough action and visuals progression for an anime, to keep you interested most of the time, i can't help but feel that there's a a niggling few missing-realism-pieces to a more complete setting, so i had to shave a star off for that.Aside from the setting/writing/breadth,the deliberativly limited weapons/armour consistencies of the Claymores also seemed un-neccessarily homogenous/limited, even-if you're to believe they're an order with rules/reg.s,surely the grumpy/cynical/better-survivors amongst them, would have a crossbow or two with good penetration, or grenades, or poison, or something - instead, the constant 'big-sword' perhaps-even peeny-envy/imitation ... :D ... got a bit... mmm ... difficult-to-swallow?Surely axes-with-spikes / picks/hand-scythes / spears , would've made better piercing weapons, for the persistently tough-skinned monsters, but instead they all go for long-blade slashing, which just doesn't seem to match up.---On personality, many of the Claymores are far too limited by relative similarities with-few-differences amongst-the-disciplied,and of the a-little-but-not-enough cynical +more aggressive , too limited by their org.s rules/reg.s, despite being cynical-enough to've ended up higher-up amongst the org., even-if they had to stick with the same armour/weapons.Some of the side-characters or non-Claymore characters are more diverse and realistic, but considering how much TIME we spend with only-Claymores, the more we hear of their stories, the more reluctant they seemed to me, to be likely to have contingencies that break the rules - there were some exceptions, i have to admit, but the 'established-balance' (of the order ) still seemed too unrealistically inflexible, if more flexibility would've meant it could keep greater numbers, as-well-as be able to rely on more ranges of capacities.The simple acceptance of the hidden/secretive leadership, without a more realistic range of DIStrust, considering that the upper leadership protects itself by sacrificing the lower members is just too much as a balance - it seems more like an abscence-of a balance.Although that's perhaps an OK realism in the context of the internal-doubt in EACH Claymore, in terms of losing-control,\nthe by-product of that chosen-constricted-realism, should've created more cynical / mixed-loyalties / conditional-service ANYway - as in, although you can set-aside how much wider-society could-not trust and rely on something that limited, INdiverse, and constrcited, for example, none of them even seem to ride a horse, for instance, for faster arrival times?.. you can still RE-criticise the abscence of more RANGES of capacities of an org. That's supposed to be USED TO protecting against different threats - surely the humans would at least have other mercenaries or something, that can fill a gap / meet a challenge that the Claymores cannot - a wave of FLYING ones, say - Claymores standing around with 2-handed swords would be useless - surely humans would've fostered / supported similiar orders / mercenaries,.. something,.. with more ranges of readiness-FOR different threats.Had to drop a star for that, too - the setting seems to have quite advanced building and metalworking crafts, but i barely remember ANY missle weapons, and there was a near-total abscence of magic weilding BY humans also, which is also too-unrealistic.Especially considering that the more powerful of the monsters, amongst the awakenedBs, start to RELY on psychic / mind-control / soul/aura capacities, and humans willingness to sacrifice themselves when we/they have SHORTER lives. I.e. With a short(er) life, there is less sacrificed compared to lost, with each Claymore lost - at one point the dialogue contained that they don't AGE - yet both the order AND the humans, are happy to have them constantly losing their experience, by this limited gear/weapons rule?Why. Couldn't give it 7, when just too many plot-conveneiences to have the two opposing sides going at each other constantly withOUT human resistences/help, forced a limit on the entire setting's goodly-types versus the force-of-evil - althoug the terrain/scene-by-scene settings change a little, the persistence of the useless-humans-in-contrast-to-neccessary-evil within EACH Claymore, was an interesting limit on their powers UNlike many series where the heroes are too over-powered, the various LANDS and powers they travel THROUGH ... all have the same policies!There's never any monster-hunters, never any mercenaries, never any standing-armies elite forces,.. nothing!---Has a well suited stop-start rythmn intro tune eliciting altenation between blocking & swinging a weapon / running & stopping, etc,time-management / storyboarding/scene-sequencing is good, and the art itself, is a suitably dreary mostly-greys & blacks, which indisputably maintains a consistent 'north' / winter setting, but then, humans seem to go around in temperate clothing! :Dso yeah, a little more double-checking in the realisms in the plot-balances / fleshing out the world/setting would've made for a more complete plot/setting, and then a few more sub-plots / additional antagonists / changing-style as the Claymores moved-throughout various lands, would've made for more of a ... we're-a-responsive-emergent-order-that-responds-to-monsters-emerging-to-ADD-TO-what-you've-got-for-defences-locally ... mmm ... arrival, in a theatrical sense.Instead, it felt like more like repetitive games of chess / lined-up ... select-your-team to fight the repetitous monsters, and on-that, those that they fought MOST of the time, were visually pretty-plain, rather than more cunning / a hidden-monster-or-two-amongst a population, like there was in the first episode.Yes, Claire's own adventure is meant to be SCALING up, else she might've been just continually doing similar scale work, but as the conflict, well-beyond her own direction/control, clashes with what SHOULD be more cunning/better-surviving monsters, most of them simply start to get larger / stronger / in greater numbers - that got repetitious too - more creativity in HOW stronger ones were supposed to've ALREADY learnt to survive weaker Claymores, SHOULD've meant more moderately strong, but intelligent ones - instead the few intelligent ones, kept leading plain, lizard-like / golem-like muscle-mass target-practice styles, and that really didn't make for much of a challenge. I'm exaggerating a little, maybe the balance was 40%/60% ... i wanted to see 80/20 ... not-many, would be simple/armour+strength ones, if they're exactly the kind easily chopped-up by the supernaturally-strong Claymores - there's a who would've survived question there left un-addressed - over-time, the monsters would've become LESS crude&chunky.---Some of the word usage, at least in the English-translation, is too-modern, too - unsuited for a medieval setting - swearing, concepts of divinity/prayer are all christian ... is it meant to be a christian setting?... etc.If they were meant to NOT be in a christian setting, then why do some of the characters, again at least in the english version, call out to / pray to \"god\" ?Yaaaawnn...",
        "I would like to see a Season 2. I enjoyed this. It had to grow on me for a few episodes. But Claymore tells a great story. The concept and plot are unique and well put together. Some great emotion storytelling. Good action. Not predictable. There are plot hole moments at times. Its almost a combination between Witcher and Ergo Proxy.",
        "Claymore was a show I've been meaning to watch for some time. It had \"some\" great characters and episodes but most of them were forgettable and boring. The show started off good, had a great middle, and a boring ending. With the same tripes for every episodeEach fight scene is the same. Bad guy acts all tough and has a NANI moment and loses and there are side characters annoyingly saying hmm interesting, like DO SOMETHING. The fight scenes are barely animated. Because it does the thing in anime where each character teleports and moves faster than the speed of light. There is no weight or fluidity in the fighting animation. And my goodness the soundtrack, it's good at first. But they overuse a lot of the tracks. Some of this show reminds me of Berserk but it's just worse.Now I loved the dynamic between Clare and Raki, loved Theresa, but that's where it really ends for me. The epsiodes with Clare and Theresa were so moving and emotional and it couldn't really pick up from there.Also \"The Organization\" makes no sense. Seriously what's stopping the Claymores from just all leaving? They are stronger in every way and it's ran by humans, and humans mean nothing in this series. Because they can't move at the speed of light. Why can't humans kill monsters? Also the world they made is not very diverse for my Fantasy. It's just medieval times with humans, monsters, and claymore (breed of both human and monster). There isn't much expanded upon and it makes little sense the more I think about it. So if the organization controlling the badass warrior women as pawns is weak. Why do they have this much power?I loved the creature designs l, even if the fights were so slow. Artwork is impressive. And the English isn't THAT bad. Japanese is better. That's usual with most anime.If you turn your brain off you may find something more worthwhile. Good show with lots of flaws.",
        "As has been pointed out by others, this is a complex series with a hard- line story and some pretty moving episodes. There are a few logical mistakes in it, and why I didn't give it a 10, because it was on that path, but I can't say what they are without ruining it for someone. Leave to say that there are just some characters you just don't kill off for no reason other than shock value. Some may disagree, but, for instance, if you were watching the Lone Ranger and half way through an episode he gets killed, the series is reasonably ended. You can understand why the writers wouldn't do that. In like manner, there are others you don't want to eliminate for the same reason - like Tonto, for instance. Sometimes you need a character to carry on the plot and storyline, or a character is so integral to the story that removing them would be a very unwise choice. It's why the Coyote can keep coming back even after he is blown up, pulverized, squished, or otherwise physically discombobulated: you need him! Getting rid of him would be a shock, sure, but then what have you got? Not a wise move. Some of that is done here, not to mention not giving justice to some absolutely horrible, deadly, people. That's my complaint. Otherwise, they present a very good story with appropriate action that captivates and interests, and fight scenes with beautiful females that are pleasant to watch. Despite a few flaws, which to me, as an author, are aggravating, the overall series is a very good and moving one that most people would enjoy. The fact is the same story could have been made with real people and it would have been just as good.",
        "I have seen loads of anime and read some manga. I can say without any shadow of a doubt that if Claymore would've been animated in it's entirety from the manga, it would've been the best anime ever made, even the best show ever made for me, because it has the best manga ever made tied with Berserk, both being of the same respect, dark, cold, hardcore medieval fantasy tragedies with immensely powered bone chilling creatures that you can't see anywhere else, alongside a storyline that even God can't foresee, a true stand alone to their kind in quality.Evan partially animated, why do I consider it to be the best?2 reasons: wonders done with limited budget; adapted after the best manga ever made, tied with Berserk, but league and bounds above Berserk in the 26 episodes both shows entail.Why is it league and bounds above Berserk?2 reasons: it follows faithfully the manga until middle ep. 22, while Berserk leaves out 2 crucial arcs from the manga: The Bakailaka Assassin Squad and Demon Monkey; while Berserk's true mindf#ck action starts only at the end of the anime, Claymore's starts with the end of chapter 2, so episodes 7-8. Thus much sooner - spelling it out as sometimes it's needed.But even in the about 1/3 of the story that the anime covers from the manga, I still consider it enough to call it, having had read the manga from top to bottom, including the anime covered bit. Waited a decade for people to animate the rest, really did my best to wait but to my surprise and frustration, to no avail, for no good reason. Good to see all kinds of $h!t today gets 4-5 seasons in return, as a constant punishment to my mental health, while in 4 seasons you could probably wrap up Claymore and sell it for a fortune, not free to watch in HD on y0utube like season 1 is now, just to be completely ignored! The blatant disrespect in both proprietary as well as literal mind-pearl thrown to the pigs just to be ignored is mindbogglingly FUBAR here! Don't even get me there... blood pressure alarm.When I see people today watching and reacting cr4p like My Dress Up Darling, Owel House, Pokemon, Spy Family, High School of the whatever boring theme, and nobody outside the deep anime cercle has even heard of Claymore, it turns my stomach. Stop watching that cr4p for toddlers and watch the greats, especially if they are encapsulated within 26 short episodes and posted freely on y0utube, the truest proverbial gem amongst the mountain of garbage you could ever find! There's no better advice anyone can give you.",
        "Great action with one of the best soundtracks I've heard.\nThe 2 things that dissapoint are the ending and the boy. No purpose for the boy except a parallel with Teresa and Clare.",
        "I'm very picky about the animes I watch and even more picky about the animes I actually like. So for this one to get a high score from me is no small feat.Claymore at its core is a dark action fantasy.It follows a human/demon hybrid warrior named Clare and her gary-stuish morality pet Rocky(he's not that annoying) as they go from town to town to fight demons as giving to Clare by her boss the organization. The name Claymore derides from the huge sword she wields. The plot from the first few episodes seems like its a boring monster of the week show,but by episode 7 that thought will change.It will turn into so much more and won't let up.There's a lot of secrets in this show.What happens to a claymore when they go over their yoki(demon)limit? Hmm let's just say that they get more bad-ass(which is not much of a feat since they're already that) that's for sure, but it comes with some...consequences. Another would be why are all the claymores female?If there were male claymores what happen to them?If you want answers watch. The show is rather gory. I mean blood and limbs getting detached is like a common theme for every episode. So if you're squeamish I wouldn't watch this.Pros The Characters- are so badass it's not even funny. Literally the first few minutes of the first episode will clue you in on just what kind of main character you are dealing with, and the dark fantasy tone has been set. You will not find a mary-sue/damsel in distress in this anime. Which is surprising in itself this being from Japan and all. However,I found that the manga's, that this is based upon, author is female. That would explain a lot of things. You would have to play where is waldo or in this case where's the mary-sue to even begin to find one,and seriously good luck with that. Also character development on Clare and the rest of the claymores is skimpy but memorable.Voice Acting-top notch quality. Very good.Animation- very nice and the battles are fluid.Music- creepy and fits the mood.Cons Skimpy Character Development- Even if the character development is memorable it's still skimpy. Some characters are literally introduced in one episode and then gone by the next few. They might show back up at the end.Or not.Clare herself is not spared this.Clones- What I mean by that is all the main characters, the claymores, look like each other. They all have white blond hair, silver eyes that turn into a catlike yellow complete with slit when they use their powers, the same uniform, and while the few odd ones out might have long hair all the rest will have a tomboyish bob. This includes Clare. I mean seriously I have mistaken Clare for other claymores more than once. The only way you can really tell them apart is by their personalities. Would it have hurt to give them at-lease different colored hair? Their silver/yellow eyes and their demonic powers were more than enough to tell us they are not fully human.My kunfu is better than yours-This happens when a character likes to talk about their attacks/powerups before,during,and after an attack. While it's not near the level of Bleach, and of so I've heard Naruto and Dragonball Z, it's still annoying regardless.The Organization- They give the claymores their orders,but who or what these characters are(besides the claymores) that make up the organization is never explained. I hear its not explained in the manga either.The Ending- Way to open ended. A whole lotta lose ends and characters are never given closure. This can be rectified in a second season, but that'll probably never happen.",
        "It's hard to make a unique and emotionally involving story with monsters and swords. It's almost impossible to make fantasy look real, because most of it has a predictable plot line, while life doesn't. But Claymore manages the impossible - it's intoxicating fiction, but at the same time it's even more sobering than real life.Here's the secret.Unlike other tales about battle and struggle in which the main character has great potential and strength as his birthright, Claymore is all about strength despite weakness. Even through perseverance, you can't really become the strongest, this is one of life's truths. But you still can aspire. It's what makes Claymore so true to life.The main characters in Claymore were helpless in their childhood, but despite tremendous suffering they've managed to stand up and move forward.Claymore will be remembered as an example of great anime, not just for its beautiful animation, but for the way it makes you experience the journey. It even has a great and satisfying ending.I know it's a tired phrase, but I really envy those who haven't seen it yet.",
        "The last Anime I've really enjoyed must have been Death Note which impressed my with it's overall genius plot and the character development. Although Claymore clearly cannot reach this (well actually it's kinda cruel comparing 2 Animes of different categories), it sure has some really good moments as well. The main focus of this series lies, obviously, on good old sword combat mixed with some really impressive ideas on how to swing, slash and bash a Claymore-sword in almost every way possible. While the story seems to start slow, there is definitely a certain appeal, which I've missed on several other Anime series I've tried for the last two years. If you manage to stay with the story until the first twists and turns you start to get into the characters and what first seems to be another bad half-Hentai porn (just by judging the fact that the title is presented by full-laden blonde \"girls\" on the cover) turns out to be less sexistic and more action-laden like any other Anime you've watched for quite a long time.",
        "Up until the end, I really didn't have too many complaints, it was a really good show that got more intelligent by the episode. The witches maw -> the critical point part 1 + the endless gravestones were insanely good. Unfortunately even when it was amazing the true shortcoming was always the fighting, it wasn't bad but it wasn't nearly as satisfying when the majority of what the audience saw what just quick slashing with no real weight and clarity behind each individual blow. They didn't really explain how awakened beings can go back to being in human form, it made sense for standard Yoma but for the absolute size and power of an awakened being it seemed far fetched to fit back into a human body not to mention unnecessary, when you're that unstoppable why would you want to cower away behind a disguise? Priscilla's motivation as to why she hated Teresa made no sense especially when she could still remember everything, so she could clearly see it wasn't in any way Teresa's fault, but somehow she came to that bold conclusion. They spent so much time on Raki at the end, it was a bit overdone especially when the majority of those scenes with him just made the audience dislike his character for being a coward, lacking resolve and just being blatantly stupid. Finally to top it all off Raki proceeds to save Priscilla's life because he's a small minded little boy with no concept of a larger picture, so she gets saved and its essentially all for nothing. Leaving the audiences angry by such insolent logic and reasoning and with so many loose ends.",
        "Just happened to see this in my imdb recommendation list. Gave it a try because I was in the mood for something midevil-ish, despite kinda getting turned off by the cover which looked kind of out dated.\nGotta say, there's some magic here and I Need More! I don't know why I haven't seen it advertised on Hulu when I was specifically looking for stuff like this.\nI wanted to give it a 10 but I personally like some comedy thrown in to break up the seriousness.\nSome seriously shocking moments in here that make me wish it was a new show so I can quickly go on social media and see what other people were saying. I really hope a studio picks this up for another season because I really like the direction it was going and the relationship between the characters. A whole lot of unfinished storyline.\n*Spoiler*\nI wanted this to happen but it didn't, but maybe season 2 will do it... I really wanted Claire's awakened form to look just like Teresa. Maybe with a not so faint smile. I thought it would be poetic, actually seeing source and force of Claire's true power.",
        "I've watched this three times already. I love the characters, the action, the emotion, all of it! I'm reading the manga and it gives a complete story and it gets sooo much better. I really hope they do a reboot because there could be whole second season from the manga. If you enjoyed the show, I highly recommend reading the manga!",
        "The recommendation came from a Discord chat which was not even related to anime or manga. Needless to say, thought the affair wouldn't last long.I binged it in 2 nights.Animation is as you might expect from a budget anime produced in 2007 but it still makes it on my list as one of the best anime I have ever watched. Grippingly intense without going too much overboard. There were some weakness in parts of Clare's character development towards the last few episodes but all in all, a very good story line.It is a pity there hasn't been enough interest in making a reboot, improving upon the story line or continuing on with a season 2 finale.Highly recommended.",
        "I rarely give any movies an excellent rating but this one did it. One day I was bored and decided to give Claymore (English dubbed) a try via Netflix. Oddly enough the plot and poster art were average at best. Almost instantly your hooked into a world of demons and female warriors (aka Claymores). But its not your typical anime with female sword wielding half human warriors.Gone and are the zany/kid type humor and instead you get adult story lines and characters. I was soo hooked I watched 12 episodes straight. My only complaint is that sometimes its hard to distinguish the different Claymores since they all look alike. Its been a long time since I've been shocked by a film (or TV series) with such good quality. Only after a day of watching I can confidently say this is my #2 anime show/series of all time which was formally held by Robotech. Claymore is right below Transfomers G1 1980's stuff(not that Bay crap). In an odd way I'm nervous about watching the remaining episodes because at this pace its possible that Claymore could become #1 for me. Which is an odd feeling considering I've only watched half the season in one day and TF G1 I watched my entire childhood.Update. Finally finished the series. Suffice to say it stayed at #2 of my list of all time best anime. The final couple of episodes kind of got repetitive and the final scene / resolution could've been better.",
        "1st time i saw this, it was subbed. Then I re-watched it in English 6 times. I recommend this to any anime lover",
        "\"Claymore\" is a dark fantasy anime set in medieval world in which specialized group of female characters (called claymores) fights with monsters. There is also some sort of conspiracy going on. It is in many ways similar to popular \"Attack on Titan\" and the general atmosphere of the series resembles \"Berserk\" to some extent.I have ambivalent feelings about this anime, because it has both some significant strengths and very apparent weaknesses.PROSthe story starts off really well. The world itself may not be very original (it looks like a gender-inverted Witcher rip-off), but nevertheless it's interesting and climatic, claymores as monster-slaying beings with certain, significant limitations are well-constructed, viewers are smoothly introduced to them and hinted at secrets hidden inside the worldthe main character is really interesting, her back-story captivating, and the narrative does a good job in gradually revealing information about her with some minor, but unexpected twists. anime has almost all-female cast, yet it's virtually devoid of any gratuitous nudity and sexual objectification of women. They are presented in almost asexual fashion. Sometimes their sexuality is subtly played with but is essentially avoided. Why it is a significant pro? Because as it is originally Japanese TV series for teenage boys, one could expect absolute worst, including some teen ultra cheap erotic fantasy. Note that manga avoids it to a significantly lower extent (although it's still not as bad as most from its genre)there is absolutely no typical Japanese manga humor. Some people, including me, really appreciate it. animation is really good, and it has its own distinct toned down color palette, which I find appealing and fitting the atmosphere of the anime wellfight scenes are vivid, spectacular, action-packed and entertaining. soundtrack is acceptablecontrary to many viewers' criticism I find the depiction of relationship of the protagonist with certain boy an engaging oneCONS around half of the show the quality of the story begins to deteriorate and the show degrades itself into mediocre stereotypical over-the-top duel-driven anime.it's even worse than that. The biggest problem with the anime emerges when it gradually changes perspective - from fights of one claymore with single monster to full-fledged epic battles between multiple mega strong enemies. It isn't the problem per se, but in this case the narrative loses sight of virtually everything other than intensifying epicness of the numerous duels. OK, the show was supposed be action packed, but it ends up consisting almost only of battles.as a result the other appalling flaw is multiplied, namely typical for anime \"talking while fighting\", i. e. characters providing detailed combat commentary, live coverage of mental states of battle-participants and all sorts of annoying exclamations, emotional outbursts, trash talking, special move explaining and random philosophizing. the series has unsatisfying and rushed ending. As a result too many things are left unexplained. For example the hinted secrets about the world stay secret, they are unveiled later only in mangathere are too many too similar secondary characterstypical Japanese (or should I say comic book?) obsession with ranks and comparing different characters in relative strength is overused and annoying as hell. Another problem which started to be apparent just in second half of the seriesSUMMARYThis show has many flaws, but in the end I really enjoyed it, to be honest, much more than my rating (6/10) suggests. It is that low, because I have the impression that anime didn't live up to the potential it promised in its first half. Btw - in that aspect manga isn't even the slightest bit better. But it doesn't mean anime wasn't good, on the contrary it was definitely entertaining and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes duels set in fantasy worlds.",
        "I've always been a fan of anime series, my favourite being Berserk. I tend to focus a lot on the pacing and the built tension when I watch anime, and Berserk is The master of pacing. Another thing I tend to focus on is character development and overall sentimentality of the show. Many anime characters are quite over-the-top, a major let-down for me. As are many scenes in anime. Claymore succeeds on most levels. The pacing is some of the greatest I've ever seen, and the inclusion of ranked characters just adds to the excitement. It's always interesting to see who's got the higher rank. Furthermore, you really start caring for the characters and picking out your favorites (mine being no. 6, Miria). The show only fails on a few levels. You're in for a lot of melodramatic scenes, and the protagonist's male friend, Rocky, is just another annoying brat who cries more than good is. It's no worse than so many other animes and gets better halfway through. The second, and final, major letdown is the anti-climatic ending. There is an epic battle, but the way it ends after the battle is simply not good enough. It feels unfinished, ill and way too sentimental and moral for a show of this kind (it might have something to do with the continuing issues of the manga).However, you're in for a treat. And you're not going to want to put this show down, before it's ended.",
        "Claymore depicts a dark, cold, cruel, depressing and creepy world where happiness seems to be as rare and brief as the light of a shooting star. We follow the story of seemingly cold and distant but secretly burningly passionate beautiful characters who defy all difficulties and struggle to resist the monsters who could destroy everything good and pretty in existence at any moment. As the story develops, everything that we get attached to are instantly torn away from us again, and yet we are left with hope that it might all work out in the end. And to me, all of this is just magical.Once I stop to think about it, I'm not really sure why I love Claymore so much. In fact, I'm pretty damn embarrassed by it. While I would objectively still rate it as good, there's a decent amount of cheese and cheap stuff in it which should prevent me from being utterly amazed by it. But it doesn't. I guess I just happen to have a soft spot for this kind of cold and depressing but beautiful atmosphere and Claymore has randomly found that soft spot and squeezed it to oblivion. Or maybe it has something to do with the fact that both times I watched it I had a high fever. Whatever it is, Claymore could have turned out to be one of the most wonderful screen experiences I've ever had.That's right, *could've*. There is exactly one very big and obvious flaw with Claymore. As it is based on a portion of slowly advancing, still ongoing manga, staying faithful to manga would require the anime to have an abrupt ending. Because of this, the producers of the anime (apparently never intending to continue the anime series) have changed the last portion of the anime storyline in order to give it some feeling of closure. And... they have utterly, miserably failed at it. Not only is the ending just as abrupt, on top of that the last few episodes are now filled with nonsensical hysteria. It is so horrible it just makes me cry. It is not even my personal opinion, everyone else say the exact same thing.I would have been more than happy to see the anime series remain faithful to manga all the way, even if it meant just leaving it hanging in the end. Were it to be continued in similar quality after several years, it would have been a perfect 10/10 and hands down my favourite anime and just one of my favourite things, ever. Even with those fatal flaws, I am still loving it. If everything was the way it should have been, it would have simply blown me away.In the end, I have to call Claymore on its flaws and can't recommend it as a genuinely brilliant anime, only as a decent one. But if my rant about cold and depressing but beautiful atmosphere rung a bell, I suggest you give it maximum chances as maybe, just maybe it will find your soft spot just like it did mine.",
        "This TV show, Claymore in English, is a great show that many should watch for its entertaining and compelling content. It is set in a medieval world where humans co-exist with bloodthirsty yoma (demons). The only way to stop these monsters is to call upon the fearful half-yoma/half-human women warriors named after their main weapon: the Claymore. This show follows the story of one Claymore, Clare, as she slays demons with a young human boy, Raki, that lost his family to the yoma. This is not just any \"monster of the week\" type of show: character development is a key part of the story and it gets more and more interesting with every episode. This is still a good show to watch for those not that familiar with the Japanese Anime genre. Even though I am not an anime fan, I can still say that it is one of my favorite TV series if not the best. This anime series is definitely not fun and fuzzy like Pokemon or Inuyasha, nor is it full of filler episodes like Dragonball Z where its takes a whole day to watch somebody go super quadruple invincible God Mode. There is action in every episode and you will not be disappointed. Be careful, there is a lot of blood and gore present in the series: it is not a show for the faint-hearted."

    "Kuroko's Basketball": [
        "\"Kuroko's Basketball\" is an anime that can easily disappoint you if you approach it with the wrong expectation.So here you have to be aware that this is not a normal sports anime, but much more a basketball anime where certain players have superhuman abilities.They try to involve the whole team here, but actually they mainly focus on a group of players from different teams. That's why these are written much more profoundly and the others only so far that they fulfill their purpose.Unfortunately, I didn't like the drawing style that much, but the animation is often impressive.When it comes to a player learning a new ability, most of the time it only shows the result and not how they learned it, so viewers often don't understand how a move works either.Also, there is a lot of chatter. It is often the situation that two players face each other or even both are in the air and then talk to each other in the middle of the game.But the anime is actually quite good if you're looking for an action-packed but unrealistic sports anime.",
        "Kuroko's Basketball is an anime and tells the story of players of Basket Ball of college. The club is Seirin. There were game and trainings but trainings is extremly boring. This is a captivating competition of the bests players and teams of Japan. The performances of players given were above exceptional. The moves of players are very original and I loved it. For me, the greatest player is Kuroco and the incredible player is Aomin\u00e9. Midorima is the worst player because he thinks h\u00e9's the best. There are three seasons and one movie. One episode during twenty two minutes. There is twenty five episodes in one season. In my opinion, this is the most amazing anime of Basket. Now, I' see season two and like it. I'm a very big fan of this anime and I can't wait to see season 3. If you love the Basket Ball, you should watch Kuroco's Basket.",
        "I am about halfway through season 2. Is getting very hard to watch. First season was absolutely awesome, however the filler in between episodes the animation fell off in the story was terrible and it unfortunately continued into the second season. The focus is more on bullied and individual personalities versus team play in the game. Not to mention the animations really starting to fall off the character's eyes nose and shading is getting ridiculous not to mention around their neck area. Honestly just not interested anymore.",
        "The first season was really good but the second season goes up and down. It did get better towards the end a pretty decent basketball series a little drawn out at times though. However what anime isn't these days. I would like the third season to have a little more training montage is those were pretty good.",
        "It doesn't matter you love sports or not. This anime will surely entertain you. It is similar to haikyuu.",
        "I am going to make this easy...... This is one of the best sports animes ever created, period! It is also one of the best animes I have ever watched. Even if you are not a sports fan you will enjoy this show.Watch or watch not, there is no try. ;-)Don't miss this one.",
        "Quite an unbelievable storyline that never goes away. I much preferred haikyuu.",
        "So I started watching kuroko basketball and when I started watching the first episode I quickly started to watch more the guys in it were so hot also it's a great sports anime btw and I definitely recommend this anime! Really interesting anime and plot and setting",
        "It's so unbearable boring and unrealistic. I don't know how people have rated this so high. The story is slow and BORING. I just finished season 1 and EVERYTHING before episode 20 is trash. The story starts at episode 20 for the 25 episode season. But even then, it's a 5.5/10 max. I would never recommend this to someone unless they watched every show on Netflix and this was the only one left. Like me.Also... Why do they all have lines on their necks?? Even the girls, looks like a 5:00 shadow. It's really annoying.",
        "The anime's story is fabulous. The story's composition is really amazing. The story goes like The Teiko Junior High basketball team rose to distinction by demolishing basketball teams within Japan, winning the junior high Nationals for three consecutive years. The all-star players of the team became known as the Generation of Miracles. After graduating from middle school, the five star players went to different high schools with top basketball teams. However, a fact known to few is that there was another player in the \"Generation of Miracles\": a phantom sixth man. This mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, if little-known, team. Taiga Kagami - a naturally talented player who spent most of middle school in the US, aim to bring Seirin to the top of Japan and begin taking on Kuroko's former teammates one by one with the help of kuroko. I recommend every anime lover.",

And... \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05",

        "A group of incredibly talented basketball players (The Generation of Miracles) who all played for the same middle school end up rivals in their high school leagues. All five of them are incredibly talented, and each member has his own unique special ability. However, there is a secret 6th man, Kuroko, who also played on that team. Our story follows Kuroko, Kagami (his new teammate), and their new team as they vow to defeat each member of The Generation of Miracles.So why does this anime work? Three reasons.1. Character development\n2. Tension and hype\n3. Fun and Humor\n4. Quality Animation / VoiceworkCharacter Development - Kuroko's Basketball starts off with fairly one-dimensional main characters. But as time goes on, we learn more about them and their deeper motivations. Things change for them as they learn and grow. Also, the other team-mates and rivals each get their moments and development too. We learn each of their struggles, which make the outcome mean something. If they win or lose, you feel the same excitement or disappointment. This is why this anime shines so brightly. So many character arcs get completed in this show, it's honestly incredible. I was brought to tears a few times during this show.Tension and Hype - For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Each game has mini victories and defeats, rather its new strategies or character moments. And each strategy works only for some time before the opponent catches on. This makes each accomplishment feel intense and exciting, since at any moment the tide could change. Also, with this being a sports anime, the weight of the world is not on our heroes' shoulders. They can lose. It's possible! So, who knows what will happen? This anime builds so much hype as you watch. It's a freaking roller coaster ride.Fun and Humor - I normally don't care much for filler, but this anime is an exception. I love seeing these characters bond. I like seeing how rivals act when they're not on the court. How friendships and trust get built. This aspect feels real and gives you a strong attachment to the characters. When they're having fun and joking, you certainly feel a part of everything.Quality Animation / Voicework - It's just easy on the eyes and ears. I prefer English dubs in general and this one is solid. Some verbiage started out a little weak in season 1, but I think the dialog gets better as the show goes on (or maybe I just got used to it). I also think the animation is really good too. Great job to everyone involved.I'm glad I spent my time on this. Honestly, I'm rewatching it again because I enjoyed it so much. I think it's very worth your time.",
        "Pretty good show, even if you dont like sports anime , youll probably like this one.",
        "YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE BASKETBALL TO ENJOY THIS!!This show is all about the characters. How well each character interacts with each other, how diverse and interesting every basketball team is, and how the characters grow.Seriously, the generation of miracles is one of the most well thought-out group of characters, with each student continuously fighting for the position of favourite character. Not to mention Teppei, Hyuga, Kagami... It's just a smorgasbord of excellent characters which blend perfectly together, and build up to one of my favourite endings of all time.Great show. Do yourself a favour and watch this!",

        "I'm a die-hard basketball fan. I've watched a lot of basketball movies (Hoosiers, Glory Road, etc.) and the one thing they all have in common that absolutely bugs me is lack of defense in games. I lost hope and thought all basketball movies/TV shows were like that.But, Kuroko's Basketball surprised me! Every character and team in the show displays tenacious, realistic defense in games! The characters and teams demonstrate strategic thinking, analytical observation, emotion, and heart within their games. I loved that! Basketball is mostly a mental game, like chess, and this show does that so beautifully! Every player, every team, every game has its own style and unique challenges! Every game is different, unique, and more entertaining than the last! Any game-winning play is never predictable--you're always in suspense and never know what'll happen until the game clock runs out! I loved the humor! Character interactions and awkward situations are hilarious! This show taps into a lot of your emotions. You'll laugh, you'll get angry, you'll be heart broken, and you'll be on the edge of your seat! When I say \"super-powered basketball\", I'm referring to how unique basketball skills and abilities are dramatized to look like superpowers. And it's awesome! Plus, characters get better and better throughout the series, and it's awesome to see them develop new exciting moves or new dominating abilities.The music gets better and better every season! It sets the appropriate mood with precise timing.You'll love this show!",
        "I'm not finished yet, but here are my thoughts up until season 2 episode 19.I don't really like basketball, it might be my least favourite sport, but I was really liking Kuroko no Basket. When an anime, a story is good, it just is and it is very enjoyable even if you don't share the same interests as the main characters.Kuroko is not just the underdog in this anime, he seems to be punished by the Gods for him to play this awful. I do not think that someone that trains as hard as Kuroko for years can still be this pathetic and get tired like he does after a jog or just a few minutes of training. But in season 1 Kuroko is still enjoyable to watch. His unique style supports his teammates even if he doesn't really get to shine in games. And seeing his lack of presence, to the point of people really just not seeing him as if he was invisible was funny... at first. How is it possible for him to be so invisible in court when he is still a normal player? I don't think other players are that dumb.I did not mind all this that much in the first season, because I thought he would get better and better. But he's just not. I mean he develops a new trick like vanishing drive, misdirection overflow which are insanely stupid that it doesn't even seem like basketball anymore. When he does an ignite pass the animation portrays it as if it's Goku playing basketball.The Generation of Miracles were really cool at first, but they're way too overpowered for their own good. I mean Midorima can shoot from anywhere in the court, no matter how far or the angle. How is he not the most feared from the Generation of Miracles?! Because even though they say he has a limit of how much he can do this, he just reaches and goes way beyond his supposed limit.Now what I really an starting to get annoyed from is that it seems it's a bunch of overpowered individuals playing amongst mere mortals. I don't mind this talent over practice discussion. There is a saying that talent is 10% and hard work is 90%. Everyone there works insanely hard, but the Generation of Miracles is not just 10% better, they're 100% better. And the only way to even beat one of them is to become one of them. Basically you need to get some superpowers to defeat them. It's literally like seeing Professional NBA players, playing with 4th graders. They are all in highschool, they train the same, they cannot have this overwhelming difference in skills.I do not mind this being Super Basketball, if everyone was overpowered in some way. But it's like the plot of the story has chosen it's favourite players and will give them new superpowers every single game and everyone else is just not in their level, because the author doesn't like them enough. And the Zone mindset they're introducing now is just the lamest thing ever. You can say this sort of exists in real life, but it's just great concentration in the game, it's not like you summoned a monster to take over your body and play for you.The only reason I am still watching is because I'm intrigued in Akashi's character. Hopefully it gets better.",
        "I'm huge into Sports and Anime so this show brought the best of both worlds for me. I really like Haikyuu, but I would have to say that KNB is way better (my personal opinion). Anyone looking into watching an intense sports anime with great character development, I'd highly recommend KNB (Kuroko No Basket). So many scenes will have at the edge of your seat. I got goosebumps watching this anime.",

While watching season 1 before every play i was saying same things gonna repeat itself and in one way kuroko and kagami gonna find a way to defeat their opponents but it changed actually even when I'm saying this play still was fun and i watched all plays in excitement. As episodes goes players developing themselves and it's good to see their improvement (especially my favorite character kagami). And their love and passion for basketball make me feel motivated. Everytime i watch the anime i feel like i must work for my goals too. {I feel like i must add that all the boys were hot in the anime and actually this and my love for watching basketball were the main reasons why i watched the anime}"

For those of you read ing this review and haven't seen Clannad, go watch it first before reading more of my review, so spoilers ahead!\n-\n-\n-\nAnyways I don't agree that this anime is emotional than Clannad because the girls on this are luckily alive despite being admitted to hospital. Unfortunately for Clannad, the main guys lover and their daughter both die from illness. I was unable to finish the ending because it was just beyond sad and emotional man!This anime is good enough if you like the harem genre even though it's just not my personal favourite.

It is winter almost throughout the anime, which perfectly mirrors the sentiment of the characters. Every episode, there are 24 in all, feels onto the next extremely well and the plot is very adult when it comes to themes of love and loss. You'll ready want to watch this to the end to see how the story evolves. Nothing else to say other than highly recommended.",

There is always, a deeper story within the many stories throughout their animes and Kanon is definitely one of them. Here you have a boy returning to a place he has very little memory from, and runs into girls from his past who he helps in order to place all the pieces together. Clich\u00e9 maybe in terms of most animes made by Key? Maybe. What separates Kanon from other productions however is the use of amnesia and dreaming as a way of coping with many different things in terms of family, suicide, death, love and many more. What I loved about the anime itself are the relatable characters as well as the colorful personalities of all the characters. What I also liked, and this goes for all of Keys animes, is the music. I love the music, and I love the scenes each song is played in. It fits the mood so well, and definitely gives you that emotion you are supposed to feel during difficult and memorable times. There are some elements that might turn people away from this drama, such as supernatural moments and situations, but they are a crucial part of the entire story and I think it tied the ending extremely well. Needless to say, as said above, nothing is as it seems. Ever. And that can either be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. However one thing is for certain, you will not be disappointed in this anime. I recommend this to basically everyone, even if you're not a huge fan of drama animes, give this a shot. You'll find that you might really like it.",
        "Well, Thats about it... Its the best \"romantic-type\" series that I've ever seen.Its basically the story of a high school guy named Yuichi that comes to a new town to live with his aunt and cousin. As time passes he begins to know other characters (mostly girls) (by the way...They are all so very cute)and they start to become really good friends.As times continues to go by he discovers that he has met some of the girls before and his memories from previous vacations spent in the town start to come back. He then realizes that this previous visits weren't always nice and that some stuff where buried in his deepest memories for a reason.Animation is superb, so are music, character development (one of the best EVER, almost every character is deeply developed and almost every personality and background is perfectly done, just amazing!!) and most importantly, the feelings. This series has an amazing ability to transmit feelings if you are not a very strong person for this kind of stuff you will probably cry, or at least feel like it a lot.Its just one of the best animated series ever, absolutely beyond all words... I absolutely recommend it...",
        "Based on a popular dating sim video game, you would be forgiven in thinking that the anime that used it as it's source material may not be that great. Surprisingly however this is not the case, Kanon is a wonderfully poignant story of love, loss and forgiveness that inspires a warmth that is ironically in direct contrast with it's snow covered winter back-drop.Yuuichi is the protagonist in this drama, he transfers to a distant town where his cousin and aunt live - it's a quaint location, midway through the winter season where a thick blanket of snow covers every surface. Yuuichi is no stranger to this place though, he has visited before when he was younger, and the events that occurred then would now on his return begin to fully transpire.A Criticism squared at Kanon is it being too formulaic, and this is more or less the case, a vaguely familiar pattern emerges after the second arc or so. The major characters that were introduced quite early on all have their own dilemmas - often the root cause being something that happened in the past. However regardless of this flaw, the anime as a whole doesn't really suffer for it. The real draw is the fleshed out characters - mannerisms, eccentricities and sheer personality all intertwine to form a group of people that you really genuinely care about. It's nearly impossible to not be charmed by such a winning combination.This all lends itself to undeniably it's greatest strength, because you can emphasize so well with them the moments of harrowing sorrow are all the more moving. So as a result it's almost guaranteed that you'll tear up watching this - only complete un-interest in the genre or a lack of pulse are any reasonable excuse not to!Kanon is a thoroughly engrossing drama with an emotive pull that is almost unparalleled,sumptuous relationship based progression make this stand out amongst it's field as well as making it highly memorable to the viewer. To some though, the charm and cuteness may at times be too sickly sweet - which is really encapsulated by the strong Moe style that the show uses, which can it must be said take some getting use to. The narrative is consistently strong however; with sufficient pacing and variation that this is quickly forgotten. The only drop in momentum comes towards the end of the series itself where some loose ends get tied a little too conveniently. But don't allow this to deter you from watching this spectacle - beautiful in both animation and narrative Kanon is essential viewing for anyone interested in the genre. A whimsical Winter Fairy tale that will melt even the most concrete of hearts.",
        "Each branch line in the story is handled naturally and can also be intertwined with the same theme. Thanks to the powerful change ability of Kyoto Animation, the audience can get different emotional experience from another form of expression without losing the tone and core of the original work. With the experience of the adaptation of the previous film \"Green Sky\", and the increase in the number of episodes, the rhythm of this film is controlled to feel relaxed and relaxed, the story is spread more leisurely, and there is more space to shape the image, and the audience has more time to \"make friends\" with the characters, which can be more deeply moved. In addition, the performance of animation also adds a lot of points to the atmosphere. My favorite is the scene of the four seasons exchange at the end, which is very good with the soundtrack. The background of this work is the story of a limited number of protagonists in a relatively limited geographical space in a small town that Ma Zhizhun is good at describing. At the same time, it is still very moving. However, compared with the previous work of pure tragedy, this one can bring more warmth to people. However, there are also some minor defects. The story of Yayouxian in the Moon Palace is explained a little quickly, and I feel a little abrupt.",
        "How exactly do I sum up kanon? It has a lot of things going for it and I really enjoyed just as much as I think a lot of people will. But the question that I'm asking myself is, is it a masterpiece? The plot meanders around a bit in Kanon but unlike other shows where I will criticise this for I can see that Kanon wasn't necessarily used to create a plot. It was made for the viewers to experience something a little different. They seem to have some sort of a plot going for the first 2-3 episodes where our main character Yuichi Aizawa returns to a little town which he used to spend most of his childhood in but the thing is he doesn't seem to remember much about the town aside from his cousin Nayuki and his aunt Akiko. While spending time in the town he encounters some girls that are all connected with his past and the more time he spends time with them the more he remembers about his past. So the plot goes into arcs with each girl getting about 5 episodes with Yuichi spending time with them and helping them out with problems in their lives. Now you might be sitting there reading this thinking that it doesn't sound that good and you may be right but it isn't exactly about that. It's about how Kanon delivers this to us. The one thing that stands out to me about Kanon is how they deliver this simple idea and turn it into something emotional. I'm not gonna lie I did end up crying a couple of times during Kanon. Mainly because it addresses a few depressing themes. It tackles stuff from self-harm, suicide and disease. But Kanon isn't all about the depressing stuff it does have comedic moments thrown in at times. Personally I think just that should tell you that you should watch this show.The characters are fantastic and none of them are the same. You have varying characters with all sorts of different personalities. There is the energetic character, the attention seeking character, there is also a character that is intentionally made bland because they want to add a mystery persona about there and they succeed in it. I wasn't that fond of the dub however. There wasn't that much wrong with how the lines were delivered or anything it's just the voice actors in general. They all seem like pretty good voice actors it's just that I didn't really think their voices matched with the characters. I personally preferred the sub version.The animation is similar to my thoughts of Bunny Drop's animation. Mostly the animation seems good and the animation adds something more to the characters called moe. It makes me like the characters even more with the animation that they're given. I know that that may sound a bit strange but if you watch just one episode of Kanon you will know what I mean. However I did notice sometimes in the show that sometimes the animation stuttered a bit but overall it was good.Like Bunny Drop there isn't much I can say about the sound in Kanon as unlike other animes there isn't much action (there's like 5 episodes of some sort of action.) The sound that is used in Kanon though is good. That's all I can say about it because there ism't much to talk about it was just good.I highly recommend Kanon to everybody I know it misses a few marks off of me because of a couple of flaws it has. I would say give it a miss if you can't stand disturbing or depressing themes though.",
        "This anime is one of the only animes that actually managed to make me burst into tears. It also made me laugh plenty of times. This anime is both funny and sad at the same time. Yet, as sad as it was at times, I was hooked. I could not stop watching. Every situation had me hooked, and I had my eyes glued to my TV, wanting to know what happened next. Each character is very interesting, and very unique. Sometimes, I felt I could actually relate to them. Overall, I had a very great time watching this anime. And trust me, all the girls in this anime are very cute, and very nice. So if you like funny moments, sad moments, romantic moments, and cute girls, this anime is for you! It's a great show; I definitely recommend it. 10/10 stars",
        "First, what a pretty show, great sound, lots of nice soundtrack bits, including cameos from Pachebell's Kanon in D.Rest, well.. for an anime based on a video dating game, I think it is very impressive. It has a satisfying and heartwarming ending, and a whole lot of angst and humor before, especially good humor. If you are in a hurry, don't even bother, it is very slow paced, very gentle in it's approach. If you have the time, and the inclination for the genre you are in for quite a treat.For me, this version of Sad Girls in Snow worked well, a story about magic in winter, forgotten relationships, and new ones. Winter magic done right.Recommended",
        "I liked this anime too much.. but sometimes it got boring but not for long just small parts. I would have liked this anime more if they didn't show that Ayu was alive n it was a dream. instead they could have said she was a ghost that would have been better and made Yuichi and Nayuki a pair coz i felt bad for her at the end!!The middle part of the story is interesting though. Like demon hunting with Mai(Mai's arc). A fox turning into a human (Makoto's arc). and lastly Shiori's arc.Lastly my opinion is they made a great story through but in the end story got a little overboard. I guess to make it a Happy Ending."

    "Big Windup!": [
        "After watching Haikyuu, I pretty much knew what to expect out of a sports anime. Each play gets 2 minutes of internal dialogue. In Haikyuu they skip a bit, but Big Windup is literally an entire season of shows for a single game.On the plus side, again, like Haikyuu, you really get a detailed analysis of the sport. It truly is like a teaching tool for baseball. That is, to me, very entertaining. Now, the super neurotic pitcher can get unnerving at times, and why they made the coach a gigantic breasted Wonder Woman is a mystery, but it all works.Sports anime lovers will enjoy.",
        "I still remember this anime until now. And i think to Rewatch again. And this anime still the best anime just not for the story but also every detail like expression that character used. This anime got 2 seasons (for now and we still hope for continue) and the first season maybe you will find it's an old animation but for the second season it gets better. I feel so emotional about the relationship between Pitcher (Ren Mihashi) and Catcher (Takaya Abe). And every character makes you feel to join the team because every person in Nishiura 9 (team name) has a good Personality.Anyway i watched the Japanese version and i think it's still the best version of Big Windup! Or you can find it with Ookiku Furikabutte."

    "Steins;Gate": [
        "Well that's not entirely true. Actually the story gets very complex at times and you may be lost for a moment or two, trying to figure out where you are and what is happening. But the characters are so affectionate and so lovable that you won't have a problem sticking with it. That doesn't mean they don't have flaws, quite the opposite, which is what makes them feel so \"real\".The beginning episodes may feel a bit \"boring\" or at least not as exciting as the rest becomes, but you shouldn't have a big issue with that. Also this is necessary for character building/introduction and other reasons. It really delivers on many levels, comedy wise, drama wise and thriller wise. It doesn't shy away from violence either. Though it's not a big part, when it happens you can feel the impact immediately.Weird, nerdy and uncomfortable at times, this really knows what it wants. Great anime show, that produced a couple of games and has way more to explore than just this TV show ...",
        "This is one of my favourite anime series of recent years; it features a good story, a great cast of characters as well as moments of both comedy and tragedy. The story follows Rintaro Okabe a self-styled mad scientist who has invented a time machine from a microwave and a mobile phone\u0085 he can't transport people but figures out how to send text messages back in time, which can cause time to change; each time it changes only he can remember the previous time line. Itaru \"Daru\" Hashida a computer hacker and Kurisu Makise a girl who died in the opening moments of the first episode but came back to life after one of his experiments assist him along with his old friend Mayuri Shiina. In the early episodes he sets about using the machine to improve the lives of his various friends but becomes aware that he has come to the attention of SERN and they want to stop his actions. One day they find him and in a shocking moment one of his close friends is killed. He repeatedly tries to change the past to save her but whatever he does she dies. If he is to save her he must undo everything he has done\u0085 and ultimately that will mean Kurisu will die again; will he be able to make that sacrifice or will he find a way to save her? As stated before I really enjoyed this; I was quickly pulled into the story and eagerly looked forward to seeing each new episode. Rintaro was a great lead character as he was both funny and sympathetic and the rest of the group were fun to watch too. I had thought it was a comedy until the 'tragic moment' when I was genuinely shocked! The animation style is more realistic than many anime series and a more subdued colour palette gives it a distinctive feel. I strongly recommend this series to fans of anime and science fiction alike and hope that it gets a DVD release here one day.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I just binge-watched the whole series in a few days. It has one of the most compelling story arcs of any anime I've seen. The early episodes are interesting but not exceptionally so, with an unstable protagonist, a schlub, and some idiot cosplay girl. But it's amusing, and various characters are added. The time travel story starts slowly, but this is necessary, and the series becomes incredibly compelling as the results of small time shifts create big problems. At times I got a little lost in the story, but the series does generally catch you up again, and while I would need to see some sort of elaborate diagram to see if this all holds together, in my mind it seems to.The series is swimming in time paradox issues, and at times I think it's closer in spirit to fantasy than to sci fi, especially since there seems to be a rather unscientific concept of fate, but it's incredibly absorbing throughout, and the characters become surprising likable and nuanced as the series progresses.",
        "Discovered anime late in life and was pretty much gobsmacked not only by the quality (usually high) but the variations. As with any other production most usually do one thing better than another, some have better art, some better scripts, some better voice actors, etc. And then we have Steins Gate, pretty much a 1-of, where every aspect is well perfect. (Yes, I know, a very controversial statement. I have seen anime fans say the same thing in chat groups, only to elicit responses of contempt, suggesting perhaps their parents never married). But folks this is I think as good as it gets. Superb art. Super voice actors (in Japanese of course, but after a while it doesn't matter). Characters so real you think you know them. And a story unlike any other. No crazy wars, no crazy magic, no crazy fantasy world, just a young man with delusions of being a mad scientist, with his own Scooby gang, who actually invents a time machine (sort of) and then has to stand by while his world comes apart. This series is nothing less than extraordinary. And oh yeah I almost forgot. In an entertainment universe of a million love stories (with my favorites being, in no special order, HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, LADYHAWKE, and the Buffy TV series) the love angle in this is nothing short of spectacular. Especially for animee.",
        "I found the beginning very confusing. Like for me getting into a series,in the very begininng, I'd rather know what the hells going on and why the reason any type of situation is happening. Steins gate was just rather complicated at first, although as I went on, it was getting to be better because you kinda know what mad scientist Okabe is up against. His character does have a mix of both Rick&Morty plus Marty & Doc haha. \nAs well J Michael Tatum was good in his role as him also!Steins gate does have likeable characters such as Okabe himself, the beautiful redhead he has a lover, Makise and Okabes hilarious friend Itaru. I was so glad that Okabe and Makise did kiss in this because they were adorable even if they were two different people with two different personalities. I loved how Itaru always was this sarcastic buck that just can come out with anything, seriously they need to get that guy a seperate new show from Steins gate, he'd just make you laugh so hard at times lol!Steins gate was pretty ok but I wouldn't call this the best anime I've come across but I have to say the voice acting in English Dub, was pretty well done!",
        "After watching all 24 episodes including 2 specials I must say I am very impressed. This might even be my new favourite anime. I admit though it does take at least 11 episodes to understand what is happening and to keep up with the pace of things. Also, it did get very tedious at times but luckily not too much.\nIn this review there maybe, spoilers ahead and if you don't want to get spoiled please leave my review and watch it yourself.So, the story is about a young scientist by the name of Rintarou Okabe who finds a researcher called Kurisu Makise and then he enters a symposium for time then she alive and well. The researcher discovers ways they can send messages to each other in time, these are known as demails and they also discover sern (sorry if I have spelt it wrong) which is this organisation which wants to start WW3 with time travel in the future. Every demail that gets sent cause more and more havoc on the present as they are jumping throw different world lines. Nobody remembers anything different from each world line but Okabe himself.That is all I am going to spoil from here.Yeah, just from that paragraph is like the confusing part, and it does get tedious after that for a bit. Okay, just for up head spoilers Mayuri in the next world line dies and Okabe keeps on going back in time just to prevent her death. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but an entire episode was focused on that one thing but kept on having the same outcome.Okay,I promise there won't be any more spoilers from here.As an overall the whole series was good, this is just my first time getting into the franchise and I can't wait to watch the movie and the 0 series hopefully those should be good. I liked majority of the episodes and the only one I didn't like was episode 19 as I felt that could have been handled much better then what it was.I watched most of the series dubbed as that's how I prefer to watch anime over subbed and original Japanese. We have a good voice cast staring J Michael Tatum as the mad scientist himself Rinrarou Okabe, Trina Nishimura as the sassy assistant Krystina... just kidding Kurisu Makise, Tyson Rinehart as the hacker Itaru Hashida, Jackie Ross (Ashly Burch) as the cute, must protect and outgoing Mayuri Shiina and Cherami Leigh as badass 18-year-old who is time traveller called Suzuha Amane. I also watched one episode in Japanese and that was fairly good as well.If you want something to be doing with science and time travel I would high recommend this anime. But, like I said it might be confusing at first but as you keep watch it would start piecing the puzzles for you.",
        "This show is hilarious with fantastic characters and animation. Unfortunately, I stopped watching after episode 15. Not because it got bad, but because it was removed from Crunchyroll and I can't find anywhere to keep watching it.If you can find somewhere to watch it, then I'd highly recommend it.",
        "I already know with this opinion I'm in the 1% that apparently doesn't praise and worships this anime and I'm gonna get downvoted to hell, but I don't care.I was intrigued by the premise of this show that it was about time travel and having watched Dark I was excited to see some mind blowing time travel stuff.That was last year where really pushed myself and tried to watched the show to get to the good stuff, but guess what, 18 episodes later and still haven't reached, so I dropped it and forgot to watch it.Now after a year I watched the remaining episodes today and all I can say is; is that really it? What was all the fuss about? Why did people praise this show so much? Why in the hell does this show have 8.8 rating and AOT the masterpiece is only 8.9? I was expecting to see something mind blowing and was expecting be better than Dark.But all I'm seeing is talking, talking, and more talking. The show is so slow and boring that make it's really hard to binge or even watch one episode. And people were saying after 12 episodes it picks up the pace and it will be good, and to be fair there were some decent episodes in there that I don't really remember.But Jesus H Christ how disappointed and baffled I was with the ending. Like all of these people hype this anime like it's the best thing ever and I was fooled by them.\nHave you ever seen a time travel movie? Have you seen Dark? How can you give this show a 10 when 70 or 80 percent of the time nothing happens?I was expecting the finale to at least redeem this show for me but to my surprise it didn't. Wouldn't've made a difference if I didn't start to watch the rest again. Now I'm not saying the finale wasn't bad relative to the whole show. But the hype around this was so big I expected something... not so f ing boring. The rating is a joke.Super duper disappointed.",
        "A show long on my list, and one likely the less you know about the better, we follow the mad scientist Rintarou Okabe, and his ever-growing lab members, as he discovers a means of time travel and reshapes the past and future as we know it. Definitely an insane show, as any involving time travel, I moved this top of list after finishing the recent Bodies, a vastly different, but similarly premised series. Skipping the OVA and follow-up \"alternate timeline\" series, the original was a lot of fun, although gets fairly darker than I expected going into it, and changes tone considerably from episode one to the end, but at only 24 episodes it never wastes your time. Not in a bad way by any means, but you kinda just have to ignore its tropes or seeming incoherence for the first bit in order for it to justify itself. In the end its good, I'm still thinking about it, and while I may have to visit one or more \"Steins;Gate explained\" youtube videos it presented its ideas well enough that I think I understood it, though wouldn't mind a rewatch some day. If you're a fan of anime already I'd certainly recommend, probably not a great first foray into the genre, but its good if it already seems like something you'd already be into.",
        "If you read the description on the DVD you could be excused for believing this was a very lite and trashy story. The trueth could not be more different, this story is astounding. Some claim the first half is too slow, but this is required in order to get you to boind with the characters. When the stakes are raised you can't help but sit on the edge of your seat hoping for a miracle. Keep your tishues ready because this has some amazingly sad moments. Excellent music and suitable for children and non-science fiction viewers. I am really hangtingt out for the next instalment, Steins Gate 0.",
        "I am a bit mixed on why it has such a high rating. It was a sci fi anime and it was highly rated on MAL and those were the only two reasons why I decide to watch it because otherwise It didn't really grab my attention.The start is a bit confusing even me I felt like dropping it after the first episode because I didn't what was going on so you have to be a bit patient. With half of the season being really slow though things start coming together really quickly and the pace starts picking up fast but in some cases there are some halts in between. The light comedy adds a layer to the tone of the story though the tone can be slightly off at times. And there are some harem elements which I have no interest in the beginning of the series.The sound effects really add a extra layer of realism and immersion to the world. Though there is barely any music in any of the scenes but when there is music its great. The directing is amazing thing really captivates the scenes. The visuals are pretty good though there are some uses of CG here and there and most scenes take in the same place.The characters are quiet stereotypical and shallow there isn't particularly unique about them and nothing bad about them either. But they get some development as times goes on.I understand the high rating. No sci fi anime was ever well thought of and grounded as Stein's Gate which has a lot of creditability to real life scientific theories. But on the other note, the amount of plot holes and flaws it had just made it all fall into the mud. To top it off even with it's flaws I was still surprisingly hooked and managed to finish it quiet quickly.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Quiet unlikely..",
        "Rating: 7.8Favorite Episode: Achievement PointTHE time travel anime. The 2nd half was good, but the first half was slow and strange. It loses a lot of people on that first half. As a whole, it can be confusing but overall it ends well and is a good watch.",

The story revolves around a supposedly mad scientist who finds a way to change world history through time travel.Unfortunately, I can't say much about \"Steins;Gate\" because it's been a long time since I watched the anime and I found it difficult to understand the plot even then, so I don't really remember anything about it now, but I remember me that I found the characters very well written and that the team around Rintarou is perfectly put together.After all, I gave the anime a 9/10, so I must have liked it :D.",
        "This was pretty good overall but I think it peaked somewhere in the middle of the show, when Moeka was revealed to be a double agent and she killed Mayuri. After that, Okabe was stuck in a time loop as he tried and failed to save her over and over again, and the show wasn't as exciting anymore. Until the last few episodes when Okabe travelled back to the alpha world line and made things right again by cancelling out the effects of the d-mails.",

This is one of the best time travel storylines I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I recommend watching the show in the original Japanese dub as it does the show much more Justice than the English dub does.If you are looking to be entertained, while watching anime that to this date, I have not seen anybody top oh, please do yourself a favor and watch this anime.",
        "When i watched the firsr episode of Stiens Gate, I was not impressed at all. However, as the show went on, I suddenly found myself hooked to this show. Steins Gate is about this man who creates a time machine and a series of strange events ensure. I don't qant to ruin the show bur it is really good. The first half of the season is just the characters trying to make a time machine work. Tbere isn't much in terma of action, but it truly makes up for a series of interesting chracater dynamics. Honestly, all the chsracters in this show are all uniqe and just fsscinating to watch. I could just watch them all day in their lab bassement chatting away. And that is what the first half of the series is. Just these amazing characters working off one another and solving certain puzzles involving time travel. I watched this in english dub and bave to admit that tbis is the BEST englisb dub of an anime series I have beard so far. They way they talk just feels so natrual. There is a scene where a certain characters hot head gets the best of them when he accedently dtarts yelling at a girl and then she starts crying. This character doesn't know how to respond to this as they have never really made anyone cry beforw and the rest of the scene is them just kinda mopeing. There is just something 'Real' about this scene as I have witnessed or experienced something like that before. The story is also very fascinating and just binge worthy stuff. Tbe second half of the show is where thjngs really, REALLY kick off. Something unexpected happens that a certain character has to use time travel to go back in time and try and fix that problem. What ensres is just entertainong yet terribly tragic. You just see how that unexpected event has effectes them and how far they are willing to go to fix that problem.The animation is just amazing. I love the backgrounds, even the charater designs. My only complaints about this show is that the some of the scientific stuff does go over my head sometimws and the whole time teavel thing kinda confuses me at times. Bit apart from that, I 100% recommend yoy to give this show a watch. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe",
        "A Unique take on the Time Travel genre, this anime focuses on a group of eccentric friends who find a way to send messages through time & face the unexpected ripples that it created. The first 12 episodes are very slow where the story hardly moves and it was hard for me to keep watching but after that the thriller element came into forefront which made it a lot better. The main characters are very well developed & the writing in the last episodes can make you emotional. Its hailed as one of the greatest animes, I wouldnt agree to it but its well worth a watch.",
        "When you watch the first few episodes on this series you get the feeling 'what the f* is this?' Why does the guy behave like an idiot (crazy scientist), it's jumping back and forth, there is no cohesion. You get the idea of letting it be and try another series....DON'T! Slowely it develops and after passing a few less meaningfull side lines in the story you finally get totally blown away. The (main) characters develop, the story lines becomes intelligent, suprising clues come up.\nLike many time travel stories, the actors learn that their actions may have unexpected consequences, but it in this series there are also several apperently inevetable events that drive the characters to dispear. Watch yourself how it is handled, it's worth every second of the time...It's a long time ago I gave 10 out of 10...this fully deserves it: 10+",
        "WOW, now this was an amazing anime. Its been a long while since I was this interested in an anime and enjoyed it this much.The characters in this anime are just AWESOME. They are so well made and you just get to love them immediately. The main protagonist is a great one. I immediately liked him and he just kept on getting better and better. Loved his dialogues and character. I self proclaimed evil mad scientist who is a actually a good guy. You get to feel for and love every main character, and even some of the side characters. Their meetings, bafoonery etc etc, its just fun to watch.The writing and dialogue in this anime is another thing I really liked, its just awesome. The anime might seem slow paced to many because it is basically dialogue and interactions for the first few episodes but not for me. It was so enjoyable that it didn't even seemed a tad bit boring or slow paced. Story is also a great one. It is not everyday you get to see a take on time travelling in this way, which is very personal and emotional. You get to see and feel that messing with time, even a tad bit is no joke and shouldn't be taken lightly. It can have great consequences. Even when the plot thickens and gets big, the anime never lets go of its personal touch and feeling instead of pursuing grandeur scenes. The anime is really humorous too at times. But it doesn't get way too much that a person starts cringing or groaning, which is the case with many animes. In fact, the humour in it is one of the best displayed I have seen in an anime which is not specifically a Comedy anime. It doesn't get childish or too animeish etc. It just stays right. I had a pretty good laughs at some scenes while in others a smile was always present on my face.Animation is really good, well defined and detail and pretty to look at. Soundtrack is also really good. Sets the mood in emotional scenes and is rightly appropriate for funny scenes. I do wish that the anime was a little longer so that they could have shown some background of some of the main characters. Overall, I would say, a really great anime and of the best take on time travelling I have ever seen. 9.25/10",
        "So this movie is pretty much the movie Tenet but I can understand it better. Overall Steins;Gate is a must watch anime that is thrilling, mind-blowing, emotional, funny, and romantic. Along with being a unlike story with lovable, interesting characters. A very beautiful show that you should watch!",
        "Steins;Gate is from the first episode on great and still it gets better and better.As the first episodes are for the character establishment and developement, the rest is a phenomenal story amazing told with twists at every corner. Because of the perfect character establishment and developement you feel every emotion which the characters are going through.Mayuri Shiina, Kurisu Makise and Rintarou Okabe are amazing characters, they made me laugh and they made me cry but especially they made me love Steins;Gate.",
        "Every fan of anime has their favorites, and this is mine. A complete story is told with unique and engaging characters, choices that challenge the viewers imagination, and a full palette of great science fiction ideas.The story begins from a position of innocence and naivety. Goofy characters in a makeshift lab, attempting to make useful inventions - mostly out of caprice. The journey ahead can not be predicted, twists and turns taken in the fabric of reality - with time playing a huge role as a true 4th dimension.All the characters have texture and flaws, and their imperfections bring them together like members of an extended family. The story progresses with excellent use of time travel and multiple realities, but I was struck by the choices the characters make, often forced into sacrifice to protect friends for sake of the greatest emotion: love.Real life technology and occurrences are cleverly woven into the story, and this intricacy of detail is present throughout the entire story arc. Anime (generally speaking) is famous for awesome beginnings and terrible endings - or radical shifts in tone that break continuity for the viewer. Steins;Gate is the rare exception that maintains excellence from beginning to end. Meaningful questions are asked, explored, and solved. Who hasn't wanted to change the past? What might be the cost? To yourself? To people you care about? Ultimately, are people in control of their own destiny?So what have I communicated? Very little actually! I loved it, and I know I'm not alone! There is also a 25th episode worth watching after series completion, and a movie as well. The movie really is fan service, and depends upon content from the series to be enjoyed, understood, and appreciated. I have not often encountered media with such heart, that also entertains with the best of it's genre and medium. A masterpiece 10/10",
        "It really is a wondrous show. The invention of time travel has been explored many times in many tv shows and films but I think this is the best of them. It's such an excellent story that is so gripping, sad and joyful. The whole plot is excellent with unexpected moments, heartwarming moments and chilling moments but the main thing that stood out to me was the characters. They are so unbelievably realistic which makes the whole show believable and makes you care for them when something bad happens to them. The chemistry between the characters sets the show apart from any other, each one resonates excellently with the other and creates many melancholic and gratified moments. The beginning of the show starts slow but soon picks up a steady pace and keeps you coming back for more. The ending, as excellent as it was felt a bit rushed, the second last episode introduces a new problem that they have to solve as quickly as possible which could set up a tense conclusion, but it lacks the duration I wished to have a strong emotional impact on me. Overall i thoroughly enjoyed the show and would recommend it to anyone, even if it is a sci-if it doesn't focus as much an time travel as I expected it to, it is truly great. 9/10",
        "Steins;Gate is deceptive, takes times to take off, took about 7 episodes to become interesting and only became mind-boggling from episode 13 onwards, after that it was one intense episode after another. The storytelling, characters, plot, suspense, and humor are all great.The way it covers time travel paradox and it's after effects are one of the best showcased, be it in anime or beyond. The characters are all unique, wild and memorable, they fit in perfectly with the storytelling.The animation and sound itself are good, not great but better than decent. I actually enjoyed the opening soundtrack and did hear it over then skipping them.It is a very entertaining anime covering a complex subject yet ending without loose ends, a must watch.",
        "Steins;Gate is a show that is made up of many disparate parts: a dorky harem comedy, a (fairly) hard sci-fi time travel story, the narrative of a man losing his humanity in order to save another... somehow, all of these elements hold together fairly well. The strength of the ensemble and the interactions between the characters is great, and Okabe's mad science lab has to rate up there with the best series spaces.This is not to say that it's a perfect show -- some of the more minor characters feel like two-dimensional fanservice, and the last two episodes are a pretty blatant deus ex machina for the hole the writers dug themselves. But there's also a lot of genuine emotion running through it, and the same time of joyful geekiness that, despite all of the urban blight and tears, Steins;Gate is ultimately about celebrating. A solidly above average anime."

    "Bakemonogatari": [
        "This series follows Koyomi Araragi, a high school student who isn't quite human; he survived a vampire attack and as a result is slightly vampiric; this doesn't appear to affect him much but he does seem to attract those who have somehow been affected by encounters with monsters. The series is divided into five chapters each dealing with such an encounter. The first such encounter is with Hitagi Senjogahara; he catches her when she falls down a stairwell and is shocked that she is almost weightless. Afterwards she warns him to stay away from her but he continues to try to find out what happened to her; eventually she tells him that her weight was taken by a Crab God. With the help of Meme Oshino, an expert in apparitions, he manages to restore her weight and they become friends. Each chapter follows a similar course but the characters are quite different, but all female, and in each case a different solution is required.'Bakemonogatari' is a portmanteau word combining the words 'Bakemon' (Monster) and 'Monogatari' (Story) so one might expect this to be full of action and danger\u0085 it isn't. It is possibly the most talky anime series I've seen so unless you speak fluent Japanese (which I don't) you will have a lot of reading to do. The animation is best described as 'experimental'\u0085 for the most part it is conventional but there are also flash frames of text, creepy black and white live action footage and moments where the animation style changes completely. This effectively adds a degree of creepiness to the story. With so much going on I feel that this is a series that will only get better with repeat viewings as one can't hope to pick up everything the first time. The individual chapters are enjoyable and the characters each introduces are distinctive and interesting. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this series; just don't expect anything conventional.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles; as far as I am aware there isn't an English dub\u0085 the UK DVD is certainly sub only.",
        "According to the reviews this is some sort of supernatural monster thing, and yes, I guess, but mainly it's disjointed and dadaist. I was vaguely intrigued by its weirdness for a couple of episodes, but by the third episode, which is mainly just a long, wandering conversation (this is a very talky series), I couldn't take it anymore.The series is less like a supernatural adventure and more like Waiting for Godot. Reading the reviews it's hard to believe this is even the same series they are talking about. I actually checked the plot descriptions and screenshots to make sure I had watched the same thing the other reviewers had.",
        "Rating: 7.8Favorite Episode: Tsubasa kyatto sono niGood overall. It's witty entertaining dialogue with interesting characters. Almost like an anime Twilight Zone. It can be formulaic sometimes, but every arc brought something new to the table and it never got stale. The fanservice in the last openings was strange but didn't detract from anything.Senjougahara is the highlight of this whole thing.",
        "I vaguely remembered watching this nearly a decade ago, enjoyed it, and when I stumbled upon it again, figured it was worth a rewatch..\nHave to say this is one of the few times something was better the second time around.\nWith a older eye and a deeper understanding I could see so many small things, from how the \"camera\" is used to focus on the female form is all used to tell the story.\nNothing seems to be done just for the sake of fan service or fitting inside a genre, but to tell the tale from the perspective of the protagonist and how he'd see, even the silliest moment serves a purpose..Maybe I've giving it too much credit, but I'd add this to any must watch list, and keep an open mind when viewing it.",
        "Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail, Suruga Monkey, Nadeko Snake, and Tsubasa Cat. These are the five arcs that make up the series Bakemonogatari. Each one is so distinct and mind-blowing, and Bake never fails to deliver a great story. It is the tale of a quasi-vampire name Araragi, and he goes on a journey of self-discovery and sometimes heartbreak with a group of girls. They all have a supernatural connection somehow. Bakemonogatari is just the beginning of a the masterpiece Monogatari, which is one of the greatest animes of all time!",
        "\"To be blunt, I just enjoy talking to you... so I want to talk with you some more.\" \"If our opinions clash, let's talk it over.\"'Bakemonogatari' is about five not-so-normal girls that Araragi Koyomi, a vampire himself, encounters and attempt to save them from abnormalities that's been troubling them.The main characters of 'Bakemonogatari' are among the most unique and complex I have yet to encounter.Heroine Senjougahara Hitagi is a tsundere like half of all modern heroines in anime, but she is also \u300c\u30c9S\u300d, a sadist to an extreme degree, which is more common for side characters and rare for heroines. Our protagonist, as expected, is rather on the masochist side who takes on constant verbal abuse from Senjougahara.What makes the couple extraordinary, is that Senjougahara is often boke while Araragi is tsukkomi. Traditional Japanese stand-up comedy consists of a duo: One takes the boke role who says something stupid while the tsukommi role points out how boke is ridiculous, often with a violent slap in the head.The leading couple in this series, on the other hand, take turns with roles. It is particularly interesting when the sadist and intelligent Senjougahara purposefully take on boke role and overwhelms the tsukkomi. Such as making insulting statements that sound flawed, but when Araragi tries to make a comeback, he realizes what she said was true. Or Senjougahara makes a blatantly flawed statement just to hurt Araragi. And of course, plenty of intentional boke or tease spoken with so much authority that Araragi just gives up and let it slide.The unlikely toggling of comedy roles were executed extremely well, and this back and forth interaction between the leading couple is a key part of this show's appeal.There are 6 main characters in this series, and total of only 5 side/peripheral characters (Meme, Shinobu, Sisters, and Senjougahara's father) in the whole series. The limited character headcount made thorough character development possible despite being an arc-based series.Simply put, half the show is about the romantic relationship between the Senjougahara and Araragi. The other half is about a constant argument between two values: The rational vs the idealistic, with Araragi as Mr. Nice Guy seeking happy end for everyone. Solution of supernatural abnormalities as the topic of the argument.While the pacing of the show is extremely fast with approximately 3 times as many dialogs per episode, they stick to one subject long enough for each argument to sink in.Each arc is an incident focused on a different girl, but the five arcs combine to show a whole picture of Araragi and Senjougahara closing their personal distances. The TV broadcast ended abruptly, but the final three episodes over the web distribution were essential in developing their relationship. In the end, Araragi escaped the indecisive protagonist tendencies that many harem series are plagued with, through confrontation with Senjougahara's primary rival in romance.\"Bakemonogatari\" is a verbal performance with visual support. Story is driven by back and forth debate on various issues.With verbal performance playing such a big role in this show, voice acting is done on a whole new level in this series. Every characters' voices fit perfectly, and not only that, distinct tones and nuance of speech establishes the personal image for every single character. I don't think it's an exaggeration to describe voice acting in this series as epic.Music scores in 'Bakemonogatari' have generally consistent ambient feel to it, and has a nice flow. Other than intense music for action scenes, they don't particularly set the mood or enhance drama as what I usually consider to be strong BGM for anime, BUT the usually upbeat sound in the background sets the quick pace for dialogs, and makes the conversations all the more engaging, which worked very well for a series like this.OP song \"Staple Stable\" was possibly the best anime opening theme song by a seiyuu, ever. Really memorable tune accompanied by great vocal and lyric by meg rock was simply amazing.Animation in 'Bakemonogatari' mainly serve as a visual aid to the verbal performance, and it was done extremely well.Visuals for the anime got somewhat of an \"art house film\" treatment. There were many abstract and surreal scenes, unconventional cuts, and intriguing camera angles that made the viewing experience very pleasant.Character design was attractive, the main characters showed a wide range of emotion that further portrays the character's state of mind.The only complaint I have with the animation is the use of photographs/videos of real-life imagery. At the risk of sounding like a super-otaku, I would say 3D images do not belong in the world of 2D.'Bakemonogatari' is a true masterpiece with experimental production that actually worked. Attention was paid to the tiniest details, and a story well-told through series of verbal performances. Wonderful direction by Shinbou Akiyuki left us with so many memorable scenes, and this will definitely be a series to be remembered.Re-watch value is insanely high. In fact, I have watched the first 12 episodes at least 5 times while waiting for the web broadcasts. There's so much going on the screen during conversations, that you'll discover something new every single time.The 8-month wait for the final three episodes was excruciating, but the ending wrapped everything up well enough that it was almost worth the absurd wait. Given the commercial success 'Bakemonogatari' has achieved, I will be hoping the remaining novels of the series to be animated. A prequel 'Kizumonogatari' OVA/film and possibly 'Nisemonogatari' as a sequel season would be great.To be blunt, I just enjoyed listening to them... so I want to listen to them some more.",
        "Bakemonogatari has a lot of entertainment value, and all the elements combined make it a perfect supernatural-romance-comedy. Each arc is enjoyable, and has a good amount of fan service for those who enjoy it. The romance was also done very well, which leaves the view with a warm feeling at the end. It took some time to get used to the weird flashing words in the beginning, but once you get used to it, you'll be in for an entertaining ride.",
        "Bakemonogatori is trashy, lowbrow comedy, partly deeply philosophical. A good drama to boot. Harem has a reputation for being dreck, but this is one of the best shows of its generation. To start Araragi is an MC with a personality! A rarity. He is rational, and in command. An all around \"nice guy\" but with oversights and flaws that make him human. This depth of writing does extend to each girl and the only other male character, Oshino (a Supernatural consultant).Stylistically flawless. A surrealist veneer of visuals and audio to keep it interesting. Camera shots swivel instantaneously, and the eye to detail breathes the show to life in contrast to its overtly simplistic setting with nonexistent cars or humans. This is done to strengthen a core storytelling mode of this show. The main mode of story is longwinded conservations. There is action, but it's placed carefully. This sounds boring but it's the opposite. Dialogue is a mile a minute, be alert with your subs.Each section of Bakemonogatari is dedicated to a different supernatural case. In this, we progress the story and introduce new characters. The show never overwhelms you and absorbs you in its dense universe. Conversations are highly lucid, and contain wisdom. Bakemonogatori has a playful, reference laden side, but a foothold in life's realities as well. These characters have endured hardships and many moments of hopelessness. So don't watch if you expected something idyllic. This is pretty dark at times. Not too R-rated, but an adult bent for sure.Anyways, my only complaint would be some fairly regrettable fanservice elements but you can always skip past that and that comes standard with most harems anyway. Rewatching after 2 years only confirmed how well this has aged since 2009. It will continue being just as good 10 years on.",
        "The style of this anime is out of this world. It's god-tier. I've never seen anything quite like it. It's very unique and distinctive. It's definitely bizarre and unusual at first, but you get used to it very quickly as it's all done beautifully and brilliantly. It definitely piqued my interest in the first couple of minutes. The music also really caught my attention, it was during the moment when Senjougahara was threatening Araragi with the boxcutter and stapler. The soundtrack definitely stands out, it compliments every scene wonderfully. I think I fell in love with the art style when they showed the different scenery shots with the sun setting in the background. All the different hues of orange combined with the contrasting whites, blacks and grays was breathtaking. It felt so fresh and foreign, yet nostalgic at the same time. The whole aesthetic of the world was very fantasy-like and surreal, kind of like a dream. It's an amazing work of art. I was constantly pausing the show just so I could admire everything on screen. It's all beautifully, meticulously and creatively conceptualized. It reminded me of the way they use color in the game Mirror's Edge. I love how self-aware the show is. They use words like tsundere, moe and loli to describe themselves or other characters. The random at times, playful nature of the show reminded me of FLCL. Similar to FLCL, this show also has themes pertaining to adolescence that make you feel like a kid again, like you're back in high school. What a crazy coincidence - the third episode starts out with mentioning that it's Mother's Day, and as I'm writing this, tomorrow is actually Mother's Day. Even crazier is that in the show it falls on a Sunday, and tomorrow's Mother's Day actually falls on a Sunday.The characters and story in this anime are the reason why you become invested and stay watching it. The dynamic/relationship between Senjougahara and Araragi was very entertaining to experience. Watching them become closer to one another was something I always looked forward to. Their interactions were very funny at times. Senjougahara's spicy and somewhat odd personality definitely has an attractive quality to it. At times it feels like she's an alien just by the way she communicates with Araragi. She's a pretty complex girl, and kind of psycho to be honest lol. The ritual scene where Senjougahara was coming to terms with the Weight Crab, was a beautiful metaphor for repressed memories. Unfortunately, the show starts to drag around the 4th episode when they were helping Mayoi find the address. It got boring, nothing was really happening and the story wasn't progressing. It also didn't help that Mayoi was kind of an annoying character. I dropped it, I literally dropped the show during the middle of the 5th episode. I felt so disappointed. The anime started out amazing and then it just turned into pointless redundant dialogue. Ok, so the show picks up after it was revealed that Mayoi was actually a snail ghost who was impeding Araragi from going home. That was an interesting little twist. That fight between Kanbaru, the monkey arm, and Araragi was sick. The animations were insane! I felt so bad for the snake girl, Sengoku. Thankfully Araragi was able to save her from the curse. Apparently all the girls in this anime have personal problems they're dealing with and Araragi is basically there to help them. I liked the scene where Araragi and Senjou were lying under the stars, that was cozy. Hanekawa's cat personality was really cute. That was a pretty cool concept how Shinobu submerged herself into Araragi's shadow.I think the problem I have with this anime is that it felt like a chore at times. It is extremely dialogue-heavy and there's a lot of reading. If I wanted to read, then I'd go for the book. I mean that's why I'm watching the anime, because it's more visual. Yet still, the anime bombards you with text and dialogue. It just feels like there's a lot of needless and redundant dialogue that goes on and it takes me out of the show. One second the pacing is perfect and the next, two characters will be having a conversation that lasts 5-7 minutes where they segue way into a rant about a topic that has nothing to do with the story. It's pretty frustrating and annoying to say the least. But the good thing is that it doesn't happen too frequently. I also can't help but feel that because I can't read kanji and don't understand Japanese, I'm really at a disadvantage watching this show - I can't really enjoy it to it's fullest. It's definitely not a show for everyone in this regard. If it wasn't for the amazing style of the art/animations and the interesting ghost story arcs and seeing the evolution of Araragi and Senjou's relationship, I would've completely dropped this anime during the 5th episode and never would've looked back. Also, the female characters in this show are really cute and have interesting and complex personalities. I also really liked how they changed the opening for each new arc.Bakemonogatari is a beautifully unique anime that immersed me in it's world, its characters and its story. The pros: Amazing art style and animations that are unique and distinctive from any other anime; interesting and complex characters that develop wonderfully throughout the show; a beautifully and cleverly crafted story that puts an interesting spin on ghost stories and is a refreshing take on typical romance tropes. The cons: you're going to have to read a lot lol. And it will feel like a chore at times, and you will get annoyed and frustrated and might want to drop it. But you know what, it's worth it. It definitely piqued my interest in the rest of the Monogatari series. It's not anime for everyone, but for those interested, you'll be treated to something special.",
        "A very loose and carefree plot, witty dialogue, and striking animation. Bakemongatri is an iconic piece of fiction. A ton of surrealism, a slice of life with its surrealism maxed out. Very expressive, very colorful, mainly for comedic effect but also for \"plot\". Something unique about this show is that it has 15 episodes which can be divided into subsections for each girl whom has the main focus.You don't have to pay attention to understand, but when you do really digest Bakemongatri, it makes it all the more enjoyable to watch. This is a series I've always been interested in purely because of the famous scenes to come out of this series. Definitely is decent anime to just chill and watch by yourself.Beware fan service. (Hard to watch in public)",
        "This is the start of the Monogatari anime series, and if the goal was to make audiences want to know what happens next, they succeeded. The story here isn't all that different from most paranormal high school anime series-it's the execution that sets it apart. The majority of each episode is dialogue. Characters are quick-witted and sharp-tongued, so even less interesting characters are still fun to watch. And then, you have to consider that I'm watching the English sub. The original material in Japanese is apparently chock full of wordplay and manipulation of language, so there's a whole extra layer English speakers won't fully be able to grasp.As far as negatives, there are a few. Some of the \"fan service\" is unwarranted and simply doesn't belong. Action scenes in this series are few and far between, but one in particular seemed to be added in as an afterthought, just in case the audience started getting bored (which I wasn't, because action isn't what the show is loved for in the first place). Then, on the other end of the spectrum, some conversations, though entertaining to follow, add little to nothing to character or story development, and therefore seem like filler.Taking this as a whole, it's worth watching. Again, as a first season, it has definitely piqued my interest, and it's an approach to this genre of anime that I haven't really seen before.(Also: the music for this season is pretty great.)",
        "Characters are really Good , the designs are really varied and distinguishable, the best way to see monogatari is without knowing what are you about to seeThe visuals are great and am excited to continue the franchise because this first part was really Good and the messages between all the crazy stuff are so damn great.",
        "Bakemonogatari had been on my 'want to watch' list for quite a long time. And then I decided to watch it for the bingo challenge: Fall 2019 and also there is a badge for finishing this anime( I thought I had to finish all the Motogatari titles to earn the badge. Phew!)How do I feel about Bakemonogatari? In a sentence it's different, beautiful and I found it unique. Now let's talk in details about it. Shall we?Story:At first( I mean for the first episode) everything seemed really confusing. But with time things started to settle in a pattern. Araragi Koyomi is a highschool boy who is a post-vampire( I mean, he was a vampire for some time. Now he is not). He can recognise or sense aberration very naturally and that's how he was familiarised with Senjougahara Hitagi. Koyomi knows a guy named Oshino Meme( Yes, his name is Meme. And I like him) who knows how to deal with these aberrations. Soon Koyomi meets more characters like Hitagi who are suffering from supernatural situations and that is how the story flows.Animation:Graphically Bakemonogatari has a different type of animation than other anime clearly. It was different and I loved it. I think this type of art is exactly what this anime needed. The background, the characters, the surroundings, I loved everything.Sound:I want to talk about the background music that is played where a bunch of scene is shown with just a bunch of line. The suspense that held that music is praisable.Character:Araragi: Or Koyomi, it's his first name. Most the characters are female but the main protagonist is a male. He has an ahoge on his head that moves a lot( I mean a lot a lot). He was once a vampire for sometimes but he is recovered from that. He still has some superpowers though. I liked Araragi more that I thought I would. He is kind of a pervert( the kind a typical teenager is). But doesn't like to admit though. Yes, he is all about saving people and friends but not in the typical way we see in the shounen anime( like screaming how he will definitely save all his loved ones by beating the crap out of the enemy). He just wants to help despite anything. He cares. That's what makes him so great.Senjougahara: She is my most favourite female character by far. As a woman myself I am always kind of disappointed by the female characters in anime about their character developments being not so great. But I am really happy to find that Senjougahara Hitagi is a really well written character. She is violent, shows almost no emotion on her face and brutally honest. She is the ultimate example of Tsundra( Yes, it's tsundra not Tsundere). The way she confessed was mild blowing. I love her. Chiwa Saito's voice acting added a new dimension to her chilliness.Hanekawa: She is like the total encyclopedia. She knows everything. But still you will hear her say It's not like I know a lot. I just know what I know. She is a kind character with a pathetic family story.Hachikuji: A middle schooler hanging around with her schoolbag. Araragi likes to tease and harass her. And she alway mispronounces his intentionally and says she is sorry that she stuttered. I also loved her voice.Kanbaru: I thought I wouldn't like her. But she came out to be great. And also Miyuki Sawashiro did a really great job.Oshino Meme: Yes. You are not wrong. HIS NAME IS MEME AND HE IS THE MY MOST FAVOURITE CHARACTER IN THE ANIME(I wrote it in both bold and capital. You better know how musch I admire him). He is kind of an exorcist who has a vast knowledge about spirits, demons and gods. He did mention supernaturality or something was his subject in college. He has a mind blowing confidence and an aura around him which is hard to ignore. He is a laid back, homeless person. He is the one who revived Araragi.Overall?I loved this anime and I will definitely finish the whole Monogatari series. I also highly recommend this anime.Happy watching",
        "It's one of the more unique anime series I've dived into. The whole setup with Araragi dealing with various supernatural beings is pretty dope, and the way the show mixes in Japanese folklore with modern-day high school life is definitely interesting. The animation style is another level, with some really trippy visuals and a use of colors that just pops. It's not your standard anime look, and that creativity in the visuals alone kept me hooked.But, man, the dialogues are something else. They're super dense and philosophical, which is cool and all for adding depth, but there were times I just wanted things to move along. It felt like the show was trying to be a bit too clever for its own good, making some episodes a slog to get through. Don't get me wrong, the interactions between characters are one of the highlights, especially with the quirky humor and the developing relationships, but the balance between action and conversation leans way too heavy on the latter.Overall, I'm giving 'Bakemonogatari' a solid 7/10. It's got a lot going for it with the unique art style and the interesting blend of supernatural elements in a school setting. The character designs are cool, and when it gets into the action, it's pretty awesome. However, the heavy dialogues and slow pace in parts make it a bit of a mixed bag. It's worth checking out for the visuals and the concept, but be prepared for a lot of talking and some complex themes that might not be everyone's cup of tea.",
        "You don't have to be a member of the anime community for long to know that the Monogatari series is very, very highly praised. Inevitably, I gave into the hype and tried it out for myself. The result? Well... I walked away entertained, but FAR from impressed. Yes the characters are amusing, yes the dialogue is witty, and yes the visuals are beautiful, but make no mistake: Bakemonogatari is just a harem. It exists only for comedic gags and fanservice. The characters are shallow and have little to offer beyond their archetypes and their dialogue, not to mention that the \"plot\" is loose and unimpressive to say the least. I guess I have very mixed feelings about this anime; I'm happy I watched it, but the people hailing it as a masterpiece need to check themselves.",
        "I've read so good reviews and it's one of the worst anime I've ever seen.The music is just awful, the same audio samples non stop, sometimes for 3min it's just a poor 3notes piano loop, that drives me crazy.The story is very slow, annoying characters, you don't even remember their names, and we don't care what happens to them. The editing and animation also is not helping.So many better animes out there compared to this...",
        "Bakemonogatari is an anime for those interested in the unconventional and are looking for something unique. The show focuses on the supernatural affecting the characters lives and how the apparitions(spirits) they are bound by result from the unique struggles each character possesses. This is used to convey the shows idea of the mysteriousness of the supernatural and the human tendency to find answers and remedies through it once the suffering of the real world proves too harsh for some to deal with. Character development comes primarily through each characters personal conflict with the supernatural through the arcs which focus mainly on a specific character, allowing you to gain insight into the character and how the supernatural reveals certain truths to each character that they either sought to repress or did not understand about themselves, providing the viewer empathy to the character and personal attachment towards them. The animation through the vibrant colors and focus on light makes the physical features of the characters very striking and interesting to look at helping to capture the emotional moments of each character."

    "Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit": [
        "This anime series follows Balsa, a female bodyguard who is highly proficient with her spear. She has vowed to save eight lives to atone for eight lives lost because of her. Her eighth person to save is Prince Chagum; his father, the Mikado has ordered his death because he is carrying the egg of the water spirit within him and it is believed that if he lives the kingdom will suffer a cataclysmic draught. Once away from the capital Balsa and Chagum are still pursued until they managed to fake their deaths. They are still not out of danger; they could be recognised at any time and there is still the matter of the egg\u0085 legend has it that the one who bears it will be torn apart before the egg can hatch.I had thought this would be an action based series but it is far more character driven; there is some action of course and that is pretty exciting but for the most part is it a gentle, well-paced story that follows Balsa and Chagum as they travel and eventually settle down before they must run again. Balsa is an interesting protagonist; a skilled fighter who does not kill and the secondary characters are almost as interesting; these include the seer who is tasked with finding them, Balsa's friend Tanda and a shaman named Torogai. The character designs are distinctive and impressive, the backgrounds are stunning and the animation is of a high quality making it a visual treat. Over all I'd say that this series is well worth watching; I may have expected a different style of story but I was most happy with what I got.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "\"Guardian of the Spirit\" primarily convinces with animations that were pretty good for the time. The story of the anime is not extremely imaginative, but it still tells an exciting and interesting story. What I particularly liked about the anime was how the characters' relationships with each other grew closer and closer as the story progressed. The relationship also develops at a comfortable pace without rushing anything.A big point of criticism that I have, however, is that the story is told extremely slowly, so that I got really bored at times. The number of episodes could easily have been halved in my opinion and the anime would have been more enjoyable to watch.",
        "MORIBITO: GUARDIAN OF THE SPIRIT (Seirei no moribito) is an epic fantasy anime series, based on the fantasy novels by Nohoko Uehashi, first published in 1996. This anime is a hidden gem and simply perfection. When this series was first released, I stumbled upon it by accident, browsing for something to watch. I wasn't expecting much but as the series progressed, I was simply blown away by the writing, the character development, the atmosphere, the level of detail and realism for a fantasy story. The art, design and also the OST (by Kenji Kawai) were all breathtaking.\"Balsa, the spear weilding woman is a wandering warrior, who takes on the task of saving lives, an act of atonement for a past sin. On her journey, she happens to save a young Prince, Chagum, from assassination and is tasked with becoming his bodyguard, by his mother the Empress, steaking him far away from the kingdom.\"While this series definitely has action and adventure, it is well balanced in its focus on story and characters as well, so that the world building felt truly fleshed out and you feel connected to the characters and the story. Balsa, Prince Chagum, and Tanda were especially well developed characters, with meaningful arcs and changes, but many other characters left marks as well. There are some slower scenes which work through dialogue, emotions, politics and backstory but everything is key to the overall tension and bigger picture, tying things together coherently.Overall, this series is highly recommended hidden gem which focuses on redemption and the bonds between people. This epic Taiga fantasy is a genius work of art, as a captivating survival adventure and as a memorable story that lives on with you. Unforgettable and highly underrated. The characters are so beautifully created and portrayed, making this such a great watch. This series was a great find and definitely rewatchable.",
        "Seirei no Moribito is a solid anime series that boasts beautiful animation, compelling characters, and an interesting storyline. The show follows Balsa, a skilled warrior and bodyguard, as she sets out to protect a young prince from those who would harm him.One of the strongest aspects of the series is its world-building. The show takes place in a richly detailed and immersive world, filled with diverse cultures and unique customs. The animation is also top-notch, with stunning landscapes and detailed character designs that add to the overall atmosphere of the show.The characters are well-developed and likable, with Balsa serving as a particularly strong protagonist. Her backstory is intriguing, and her journey to protect the young prince is both exciting and emotionally resonant.However, while Seirei no Moribito has many strengths, it also has some weaknesses. The pacing of the show can be slow at times, and the plot can feel predictable or lacking in urgency. Additionally, the show's themes of destiny and fate can feel heavy-handed or overused at times.Overall, Seirei no Moribito is a good anime series that is worth watching for its strong characters, beautiful animation, and immersive world-building. However, it falls short of being a great series due to its pacing issues and occasional lack of depth in its storytelling.",
        "The Japanese love their taiga. So much so that entire production companies are vested in bring stories of the past, fictional and mythical, to light.Moribito is one such taiga that stems from a novel series about a travelling spear warrior and her encounters with kings, princes and commoners, demons, spirits and spiritualists, while embodying a courageous noble code of not killing her opponents.Because taiga are episodic, they carry much of a soap opera style in writing and dramatic effect. Moreso than the source material they derive from. Motivations and emotions are very key to the characters' journeys and arcs from beginning to end.Apart from the through-plotline there were enough episodes to show slice-of-life scenes that grounded the main characters in their locale, and several that gave enough back story to Balsa's tale.If you enjoy period fantasy tales, this series is for you. Watch it with enjoyment.",
        "I'm no fan of flashy teenage super heroes that practically formed it's own genre, there are some quality Anime (Jap-animation) out there, some preferred classics. This one, not a classic , not flashy, just purely enjoyable.The tale surrounds a second prince (child of second empress) in coincidence, hid a magical water fiend egg inside of him that is physically impossible to remove. The egg is to be known, a sign of mass drought, that causes political instability in this kingdom, kingdom of Yogo. Ultimately, The emperor, father of the unfated second prince decide to secretly murder him. As foretold to her ears, the second empress hires Balsa, a female spear expert bodyguard to protect the prince, help him escape and remove the egg in desperation.Though, the protagonist here is Balsa, twenty-nine years old, mysterious fated.Action, drama, character development, what more to crave? But, I didn't gave it a perfect score due to some lacking detail on the protagonist's face at times, this has been encountered in GITS: Stand Alone Complex series.In exchange, very improved animation in TV series's medium, easy plot, fluid character movements, stable frame rate, logical martial art sequence (not like those overdone Bleach of sort) and character behavior, nice suspenseful music (Kenji Kawai's), and masterly directed (Kenji Kamiyama).",
        "'Seirei no Moribito' may be not the most popular anime out there, nevertheless it has gained some fame - given that even I heard about the series and I'm not an avid anime fan. It is 26 episode show adapted from the novel which is under 300 pages long. And unfortunately one can see that - many episodes felt like a filler only. But I should start by listing good things.First of all it definitely isn't your typical teenage anime filled with over-the-top duels, excessive talking during them, fanservice panty shots (or however they are called) and other similar monstrosities. Typical anime humor is also notably absent. It has strong, somewhat interesting, capable lead female character (with rather non exposed sexuality - I know it may be considered minor but these days even show which only restrains from sexual objectification is worth praise). The fight scenes are really entertaining and well choreographed, animation is nice (however I'm not an expert on the subject and above some level I don't really care) and soundtrack doesn't annoy. And sometimes emotions depicted by the show resonate with viewer acceptably well.But it should be strongly stressed - despite really good fight scenes it is almost entirely non-action anime. It is very unevenly-paced, but mostly very slow, even sluggish. In some episodes almost nothing interesting happens. And by that I don't mean only lack of action (because many, many episodes lack action), but also lack of any plot development, any relationship dynamics, any tangible emotions, any character exposition, lack of everything really. I'm not exaggerating, there are 2 or 3 episodes in which literally NOTHING happens. And when you add to them several in which something happens but it certainly doesn't fill up whole 20 minutes you can grasp how abysmally BORING this anime can be. This problem haunts especially the middle part of the series, the beginning and end are noticeably better - but I still wouldn't call them good in that aspect.When it comes to the story it feels, I'll put it bluntly, stupid. Motivations of certain characters (the ones from the imperial court) are for me utterly non-comprehensible, in the result main reason for the plot \"emperor wants to secretly kill his second son, because the son is possessed by dangerous demon who can cause massive drought\" seems unconvincing, all the more the demon turns out to be not so dangerous and actually prevents drought. And I really can't shake off the impression that many things happen ex machina, without explanation, only to save the day or advance the plot further. By the way most characters (apart from protagonist and maybe his underage sidekick) are completely forgettable. It is especially apparent with antagonist side - the show lacks real villain, everyone is at most gray. It could be seen as a departure from the clich\u00e9 but in this case it isn't really a good thing, because it makes the forgettable antagonists even more forgettable.To make things worse protagonists tend to do things which even inside their world make no sense at all - e. g. two main characters (which are shown to be well known) want to escape from the palace and disappear - yet they stroll inside the very city the palace they have run from is located in, they wander through streets of said city in their usual outfits equipped with accessories they are known of, stick to their original names, buy and operate the mill near this city (sic!) and don't make absolutely any effort whatsoever to hide themselves. And it's not the excuse to advance the plot - they are indeed not found for many months! Maybe it's a small detail, but very annoying one.To sum it up - I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone seeking action or intelligent narrative. I think there are people who can find the characters and interactions between them interesting (and can live without actual character or relationship development) or who can derive pleasure from slow-paced, well-animated depiction of simple life in medieval fantasy world with occasional bursts of fighting. But ultimately I consider this series bland and boring.",
        "A beautifully crafted masterpiece. This anime is by far the most realistically depicted adventure anime i have ever seen.First the animation. It is amazing. For an anime that released in 2007, this animation is a full featured length movie animation. One of the best (If not the best) i have ever seen for a series.Then the story. Its just awesome. I don't want to reveal anything. Just watch it.Then coming to the soundtrack. It is very memorable and hits right on the feelings. Absolutely perfect.Then we have the plot and character development. It just goes up and up. It build the relationship between people in the exact way you find in the real world. So its very relatable and eventually you will end up liking all the characters.Overall this is one of the best anime series ever made. And on top of that Balsa (the lead character) is super badass. You will end up loving her character by the time the show ends. I really want a second season. My score 10/10.",
        "I can't for a second that this is from 2007. I've watched literally hundreds of animes in the past year and none has made me this surprised. I dont think anyone would doubt you if you said this came out yesterday because yes the animation is that good ESPECIALLY for its time, and the art doesn't feel old in the slightest both character and environment. The story gradually progresses and so the character development. Theres no five minute clip that they make us ingest and want us to care or at least be interested in the various characters of diverse personalities and values.audios heartwarming.",
        "This series is a fantasy tale, a story about survival and redemption, exquisitely crafted. There are no \"stand-alone\" episodes here; the story unfolds in a linear fashion, effectively leaving the viewer wanting more at the end of each episode. Great character development, you can't help but sympathize with the main characters as their relationships strengthen throughout their ordeals. The animation is exceptional as well as very realistic and backed by a fitting soundtrack by Kenji Kawai, makes for an elaborately atmospheric experience. The action scenes play a secondary role, one of building the tension when needed, although superbly choreographed nonetheless! There is no real explicit content but the spiritual aspects and the inescapable \"cycle of life\" theme embedded in the series is definitely for mature audiences only!",
        "I saw the last episode of Seirei no Moribito last night. Actually it was 3AM. I couldn't go to sleep without knowing what happens in the end. When the whole thing was over, I did something I don't usually do: I clapped my hands in amazement... This is something I do only when I am truly impressed by what I saw. This show is perfect! It's flawless pure and simple! The story is very interesting and beautifully told. It unfolds just right from one episode to the other like a perfectly written book. The character development, as others pointed out, is very well done! In the end you just wish the show would never stop and you develop a sort of respect for the characters that doesn't really happen with characters from other anime shows. Just like the title says, from time to time I surf the net and find a gem like \"Seirei no Moribito\". I'm glad I found it and I'm glad I can tell others about it. It's good that in our time you can still find amazing stories such as this one. 10 out of 10? Sure, if 10 is the highest score I can give it, but it's as simple as this: this series is Perfect and Beautiful! If you find it, for the love of God watch it and keep it safe! If you have children, this is the kind of quality they should be watching! Definitely a series that entertains you and also teaches you valuable things. Later I realized I started asking myself: \"what would Balsa do in this situation?\"...",
        "I think I haven't seen a series in a recent years that could be that valuable for the development of respect and caring for each other. If I had a 11 year old child I would want him/her to watch it. And let me tell you it is also if not more important for adults to have more respect for their environment and other living beings. Whenever I watched this series it gave me a warm and calming feeling of sanity and comprehension, like meditating. This series was somehow giving me a kind of wisdom. I wish there was more like this. From an artistic view the background graphics are absolutely top-notch, and the animations have a kind of realism to them through the addition of small movements to plausibly underline thoughts and behaviors. The only thing I would have elaborated on is the main character's face (the placement of her mouth?)."

    "Maison Ikkoku": [
        "I swear, seeing this anime did made me emotional, laugh and enjoy the developing romance between them two. I love the roommates too like I loved how they were taunting Godai when he was especially studying for his entrance exams. I even love how they were different as well, you never expect a middle aged woman with a kid, a posh snobby man and a sexy talking woman be so ridiculously immature. Godai's grandma was hilarious out of them all, giving Godai her funeral money instead of paying for his wedding and enjoying parties with his roommates as well. Good message to say, old people can have fun too regardless of age ^.^When it was nearer the end, we get to see Godai and Kyoko finally get married. I was actually near to tears when I saw Kyoko looking absouletely beauitful in her white kimono and when they were both at the altar. I'm still pretty speechless like the whole anime felt really wonderful. This is definately one of the best 80s feel good animes out there. You're definitely missing out if you haven't seen this yet!",
        "The anime version of Maison Ikkoku doesn't have quite so much of the sexual humor as the original comics by Rumiko Takahashi, and for some reason the actor who plays Godai tries to hard to be funny and ends up overplaying him sometimes.  Actually, a lot; but there are times when he nails the character.  Sumi Shimamoto (one of my favorite voice actresses) as Kyoko Otonashi is just too perfect.  She doesn't come across sounding like her strong Nausicaa voice or her soft Clarice-from-LupinIII voice--she sounds like a young woman who is trying to live on.The animation, while it seems crude, was actually pretty good for back them (I think the Guyver came out about the same time--Maison Ikkoku is better). And every once in a while, the writers stretch a passing joke of Takahashi's well past the breaking point, until your willing to do anything if they would only stop for a minute so you can stop laughing.",
        "Tokyo. Yusaku Godai is a wannabe college student who just found a new apartment where he can stay and study. But his new landlord is Kyoko, a young and handsome woman, and he falls instantly in love with her. Although she likes him too, she is hesitant since her husband died a not so long time ago. Shun Miataka, a wealthy tennis coach, is also in love with Kyoko. Complicating matters are Godai's weird neighbors; a middle aged and overweight lady Hanae, voyeuristic Yotsuya and always drunk and half naked red hair woman Akemi, who annoy him while he is studying. As years pass by Yusako gets employed as a teacher in Kyoko's old school\u0085 I'm shocked at how unknown and underrated \u0084Maison Ikkoku\", my new anime darling, is! It's great, and everyone should see it right now! Like with most of my favorite films or animes ( and that's becoming to get a bad habit ), I didn't want to see this because the 1986 animation wasn't perfect ( too thick necks, too big hair dues, weird animation of the dog's eyes ) but when I finally did I was richly rewarded. I call this \u0084A romance under microscope\" because it is. It shows all those deepest, hidden emotions most of the films or animes are either scared to show or don't want to show. \u0084Maison\" leaves you feeling great, energetic and happy like a little kid. The author, Rumiko Takahashi, already proved that she is a romance expert with the good \u0084Ranma 1/2\" and the great \u0084Inuyasha\", but this even tops them. Actually, It's even almost as good as my other anime darling, \u0084Sailor Moon\".---------------------- There are some fantastic scenes here. For example, Shun gives Kyoko an ultimatum \u0096 either she decides that she loves him or he is going to leave her, and she has only 1 week to decide. The following morning Godai approaches the apartment and spots Kyoko in the fog, who hides her rings under her eyes since she couldn't sleep the whole night from thinking about the ultimatum. In the other one Kyoko leaves her apartment complex for a vacation, but leaves a plan of her journey, hoping that Godai is going to follow her. But one of my favorite episodes was number 54, hilariously and adequately called \u0084Attack with nudity!\" in which Yagami, a teenage girl, fell in love with Godai who was the teacher of her class. In order to seduce him she tried everything, from staying after school with him up to placing a \u0084heart\" sign on his jacket. But when all failed, she managed to pursue her friends to lock Godai in a school basement so that she can try to seduce him with her body, wearing only a bra and a slip. Amazing stuff! The story spans 7 years and the characters change. True, there are some weak, annoying characters ( Hanae, Akemi and Yotsuya are sometimes unbearably disgusting! ) and episodes ( beware; the first 7 episodes are pretty bad ), but they are a minor point compared to some hilarious romantic situations ( see episode 17, where Kyoko first met her future husband in high school ). Understated, quiet, funny and deeply touching, this is one sort of anime that I wish I could see more often. Those who never saw this, missed something in their life.Grade: 10/10",
        "Maison Ikkoku is one of my favorite rom-com stories ever.Everything starts with Godai, who is a boy that is studying for important exams, the ones that will lead him to a great or a bad japanese university, that will define his future. His hostel neighbors make his task even more difficult as they keep bothering him. Suddenly, everybody's lives begin to change, essentialy Godai's, as the new manager (kanrinin), Kyoko, starts working in the hostel.The past of the \"kanrinin\" is really well thought out and is a perfect obstacle to prevent her from loving Godai. Due to this important fact plus many smart obstacles created by Rumiko, the 96 episodes of the series are amazing.Kyoko and Godai are very relatable and real. We get to know their thoughts so we know them deep inside and can't help but love them and cheer for them to be together.The support characters are great and well developed too. The way Takahashi mixed their stories with the main characters one is perfect.What stands out for me is how well the narrative navigates between drama, comedy and romance. This has everything to do with the lines, sometimes very deep.About the technical aspects I have only good things to say.The animation is beautiful and it aged very well to me. The expressions are marvelous and the landscapes are breathtaking.To end this, something that helps a lot with the genre navigation I mentioned are the scores. They give the perfect feeling of each scene, making the atmosphere more comic, romantic or dramatic. Also, I love the 1980s style in the scores and in the openings and endings, it's perfect for the anime theme, very passionate.",
        "It came before Please Teacher, before Love Hina, even before Kimagure Orange Road. I might be too young to say for sure, but I'll bet this is the series that started the whole romantic comedy movement. It's also one of the few with a mature enough storyline to keep post-teenagers interested.Yeah, it's the same plot that exists in every anime of the type: boy meets girl, boy and girl deny their feelings for the entire series (but hook up every few episodes), boy and girl finally get together in the end. As a consequence, the plot moves a bit slowly and is a bit too one-track-minded; more fun plot diversions would have been welcome. Still, it's a pretty funny series, and the characters are colorful enough to care about for 96 straight episodes. If you're into Rumiko Takahashi's stuff, Maison Ikkoku's probably the best place to start.",
        "I am just being selfish by keeping it underrated it is the perfect rom com and an overall mature anime I have ever scene. It is the best the way the romance blooms and the hardships they go through and it is not just about the romance but also about the overall character development it is just perfect anime I have ever seen in romance and slice of life.",
        "After watching the series in small bits it will take some time to digest it all. Watch it in slow pace.Beauty, solid argument and characters, deep emotions, funny and laughable at times, you will also have to wipe away tears. This story will be forever in you.",
        "This is a great show. The manga is even better. It is probably better kids aged 10 and up. The show is kept very similar to the manga, although it is about one chapter per episode. I think it is great the way the love between Kyoko and Yusaku took such a long time to develop, so it wasn't like a shallow and one dimensional romance. my fave character is akemmi. she appears shallow and heart breaker/ femme fatale- ish, but again i love the believable, non one dimensional characters. The comics are REALLY addictive, and so is the show. this show gets a great big shining fat five stars from me, and the manga gets even more. it is great to see such an addictive comic turn into such a great and addictive show!!",
        "THIS IS THE BEST ROMANCE ANIME OF ALL TIME and also generally just one of the best anime of all time.Best story, best animation, best characters, best sound, best music, best atmosphere, best direction, best comedy, best charm, best romance... and the list goes on, think of this anime as the Shawshank Redemption of anime, a piece of entertainment that will go down in history as the greatest of all time and a role model on how to do good anime and an example of why 80s and 90s anime will always be best anime."

    "Maid Sama!": [
        "I'll tell ya, the character Ayuzawa Misaki is such a role model to all women out there. This anime should be definately be recognised more! They really made her into a strong hardworker who doesn't back down and isn't afraid to speak her own mind. That's what I would love to see more with girls in anime and as well in real life films/series too! i love the fact she scares the lads in the school because she doesn't always disagree with them and yet, the girls in the school are off the hook. I have to admit as a girl, it was funny but I suppose she had gone overboard by treating them poorly and not giving enough respect for their own ideas. There is a few references of feminism there but look, it's a good show like i wouldn't try to let her character weaknesses put me off! Sure she's a chairperson/president of the school so they are probably trying to tell us that its not a easy job and I would hate to be president myself since it can be draining telling people off lol.Great series and the romance between Misaki and Usui was cute. I give this 8/10",
        "Misaki the student council president of seika high has a responsibility of looking after her school and making sure the students more specific the boys are all well behaved. One day a young man by the name of Takumi discovers her secret job which is serving as a maid at a maid cafe after learning her family problems he promised to keep it a secret from everyone else at school.He finds a way to tease her and prove her wrong in every episode which tends to open a door to unlock their true feelings.I thought this was a pretty cute love story. It did take me some time to get used to Misaki as a character while she does come off as annoying towards the beginning and the voice actress they hired in the newer dub did not help with it all before I switched to the olds dub. She does become a bit more likeable as the series goes. Plus I would say while Takumi sure is a character it was always a pleasure to see him in each episode.If you want to have a really good romantic comedy I recommend this.",

Usui Takumi,her classmate,discovers aboit it and promises to keep her secret. The final episode was adorable,but definetely makes you want more. I loved the voice actors,especially Nobuhiko Okamoto as Usui. The chemistry is very good! Misaki is a very strong girl who holds to her primcipals. This shoujo anime is one of its studio most popular and I can definetely see why. Overall,very good anime and woukd reccomend to read the manga,since it is completed.8,5/10.",
        "Maid-sama is a an easy-to-watch anime with entertaining characters, all stemming from the unusual concept of a very straight-laced protagonist working part-time at a maid cafe. I watched this years ago when I was younger, and remember really liking it, but upon re-watching there are several aspects to the show I'm critical of. Also, please recognize the cult following this show has, as my opinion is not overly critical but definitely less smitten than others.Maid-sama is a show that's pretty digestible and easy to watch. Little is left as a mystery, and not many subplots run for more than an episode or two. It's super easy to pick up and put down in that regard. However, there are a good few filler episodes that slow down the plot development, and I would say this one is already pretty slow in progressing. The final five episodes or so really pick up the pace, which I liked a lot.I think the characters are what made me want to finish this whole show. At first characters fit general shoujo tropes, but deepen as they have an episode or several focus on them and their backstories. As a whole, the characters are entertaining in their owns ways, albeit a bit predictable. Many of the side characters were more loveable to me than the protagonists!My biggest problem with this show is how it casually uses sexual themes and assault as a means of conflict or as gags. I understand that shoujo media does occasionally use unrequited advances as a means of developing character relationships, but for it's TV-14 rating, I'm surprised at the content. In particular is when the protagonist is nearly sexually assaulted, but is then rescued by the love interest. There's also a scene where the love interest gives the protag a hickey without her consent, and another episode where an entire plot point is protecting the female students from the male ones who have turned into 'wolves' from lust. Some of the love interests advances border on creepy, but ultimately seem fine within the context of the show.All this being said, I still think the romance between the protagonists is charming, entertaining, and something I wanted to watch develop. I wish it had grown more consistently given that this anime has 26 episodes, but the final five episodes or so were significantly better than most of the first half. Overall, though, it's not a show I'll be revisiting again, even for nostalgia.",
        "I know the new guy never really had a chance, but if you add a love triangle in a show it rarely, or never, makes it better. I could barely watch the end of the season because of that, and I would have given this show a high rating if it didn't have it and if the love interests got together earlier on. Alas, neither of those things happened.",
        "Souka High School uses to be a all-boy school and had recently became a co-ed. The male students are still in a high majority. In this scenario, Misaki Ayuzawa works hard in academics, athletics and to make school a better place for girls. She eventually becomes the first female student council president. However, despite her reputation, she secretly works part-time at a maid caf\u00e9 in order to support her ill mom and sister by returning the huge debt their father had left them. Misaki's secret is soon discovered by Takumi Usui, a popular boy at school. Instead of exposing it to the school, Usui keeps it for himself.I really enjoyed this Rom-com. Most of the episodes are so hilarious and even during the rising action, there is no unnecessary drama. However, why does it have to end when the relationship between Usui and Misaki was just starting? And what about the reactions of their schoolmates or the reaction of the idiot trio? And what happened to Hinata? We never get to know that. It's because of these few missing things I feel there is a need for season 2 (even though it's been 10 years since this anime got over).",

The setting is Seika High School, previously all-boys, and with a bad reputation as a \"boys club.\" Misaki Ayuzawa is a smart and determined girl who selected this school only because she is very poor and they offered cheap tuition to get girls to enroll. Her excellent grades and behavior resulted in her being appointed the first female Student Council President. She rules the students with an intimidating stare and an iron fist (the result of weight training). Her goal is to reform the misfits, slobs, and idiots into respectable young men.To support her family, she has taken the best paying job she could find -- as a serving maid at Maid Latte. She hopes to keep her job a secret so she can maintain her intimidating dignity at school. At work she uses the name Misa.Takumi Usui is a handsome boy at school known for breaking the hearts of the many girls who profess their love to him. Takumi learns Misaki's secret and she now lives in fear that he will \"out\" her at school. However, Usui decides she is the most \"interesting\" person at school and begins following her about.Much of the humor comes from these self-contradictions -- a tough girl afraid of romance and a boy who can have any girl but chooses the only girl who does not want him.The anime covers only the first half of the original storyline, but manages to conclude with a satisfying ending. It was broadcast in 2010 and has been named one of the best five anime of the decade.",
        "Boring very predictable the characters lack personality im so bored wasted my time could've watched something better instead.",
        "Maid Sama! started out pretty good and it showed great promise. Unfortunately, Misaki's treatment of Usui, being a complete jerk towards him for no reason over and over again, seemed a bit too much. It gave out that childish vibe like she can't express herself without being an ass. Too bad, because I really liked her apart from that. She seemed like a strong female figure and I highly respect that. I just wish they would've made her evolve more throughout the season. Instead, she stayed stubborn, crushing pretty much every bit of romance under her feet, until the very end. There things started to turn a bit for the better, but it was too little too late.Seems to me like 99% of this \"romance\" between the two is from Usui's side which is not only unrealistic but also makes you wonder why he doesn' just give up. I'm sorry to say this but for something that was supposed to be a romantic anime, it sure tried its best to blow out the stem. It's a shame really because this thing had so much potential for growth. Instead, the creators chose to go with a childish version of a \"romance.\"",
        "I can't say there isn't a plot. It is generic but they have done it perfectly. The characters are very likeable and makes the series very watchable. This series is actually \"kawaii\" in true sense. The two main characters and their chemistry are heart warming and so refreshing. Although this is kind of one time series it is very enjoyable.",
        "If you're looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy, search no more!! Even if the story has a few clich\u00e9s the characters are so likable, specially Usui!! Usui loves Misa since the very beginning for who she was which is really something refreshing. He also wasn't conceited like so many other main characters and he treats her right at all times. Sure he does tease her here and there but he is not overbearing. Mizaki is a strong female character and she's very likable as well. It's actually has really good humor.",
        "The premise is great and the show is funny and cute. Usui is actually kind of creepy and possessive, though. I don't understand why they wrote him that way. He needed to be bad at something and not be amazing at everything, desired by all women, popular, etc. It was just too much. Despite all that, I enjoyed watching and rewatching the show. The romance is cute and satisfying. I'd watch a second season, but it looks like this is it.",
        "\"Opposites attract\". It is a cliche, a tired one at that, but nevertheless it works. The cliched premise of having a secret identity is also tried and true. Anime is not immune to this either, as it seems all plots must take place in a high school. Throw in the stereotypical \"Tsundere\" type leading lady and you have the basic elements of \"Kaichou wa Maid-sama!\" aka \"Maid Sama!\" a mediocre, predictable, but also enjoyable manga adapted into anime by the respected J.C. Staff studio.Our plot centers around Misaki Ayuzawa, a strong willed young lady who has gotten herself elected the first female class president in her formerly boys only school. As the school still consists of 80% boys, she rules with an iron hand and a dragon lady persona. But after the final bell rings, she is simply \"Misa\". A popular server at the Maid Latte maid cafe. A fact she tries with all her power to hide. Until it is discovered by Takumi Usui, the idol of her school, and rather than reveal her secret he uses it to his advantage. Resulting in many a comedic moment.A lovely group of side characters helps round out this show, each relatively distinct in their own way and capable of generating laughs, but the story is that of the expressive, loud, and fiery Misaki and her foil and comedic straight man Takumi. Her often explosive animation sequences are off-set by the too cool for school, bleach blonde fella who seems to never be fazed by her constant outbursts. Usui is not a creul kid, he is in fact a warm hearted, yet quietly mischievous kid who cares for Misaki as much as he enjoys tamely pushing her buttons. This is the essence of the show. The dynamic of the two. One practically is begging for them to kiss by the show's halfway point.This was not a show I was glued to, there were episodes where I honestly spaced out and couldn't tell you what happened, and others I was genuinely engrossed in. It's a very uneven product and frustrating at times. Usui is tall with blonde, spiky, hair and brown eyes. But we are introduced to no-less than 3 other characters, thankfully not all that reoccurring, that look EXACTLY THE SAME. Are they related? No. Is this ever brought up? No. Is this the animators way of saying, \"Handsome = This\"? Perhaps. But it just feels lazy after the 3rd time. The music itself could have used some variance. The primary theme, with it's catchy beat and bells, is used more times than I can count and makes it feel like a Christmas celebration is about to break out.A show that is cliched, stereotypical, and repetitive. How is it possibly any good? Well, it takes some effort for a storyteller to get you to keep paying attention to a story that we know the ending to. The formula stays roughly the same throughout the first 3/4 of the show, \"Conflict at school or the cafe. How they gonna figure this one out? If Misaki's good natured, strong will can't fix it, Usui comes to the rescue as cool as a cucumber. Rinse. Repeat.\" The latter 1/4 of the series formula only changes when another boy enters the picture. It was a nice change.\nSo, why did I finish this series? Because, honestly, the good moments are charming. There are some heart warming romantic moments. There is some fun to be had. Some suspense to be endured. And some moments that should be scary but are played off as funny. It's not a good thing when you're asking, \"Should I be laughing at this?\"I certainly didn't stick around for the voice acting. But, you can certainly tell these actors are having fun in their roles. Be it either Ayumi Fujimura or Monica Rial's Misaki and her over the top screeching, or David Matranga/Nobuhiko Okamoto's Usui soft retorts, the cast does pretty well. But this is best enjoyed in Japanese for 2 reasons, first- it's in Japan and the Japanese just sounds crisper. Second, the pain of not hearing the terrible Santry Rush's Hinata Shintani. His Southern United States accent is meant to make the character sound like a hayseed to convey he's from the country. But it's bad. Mr. Rush is, from what I can tell, not a proper VA. He sounds like Forrest Gump doing a bad Mr. Rogers impression (So, Tom Hanks?). It's the worst thing about this series. And thankfully is in only a handful of episodes.I sense that this show is meant to get people to read the manga which ran from 2005-13 and spanned 18 volumes. For what it is, it does fine. Worth checking out. 6/10. Cheers!",
        "Nothing special. It's nice to watch. Sometimes boring. It does not contain any particular message. Simple, fun. But there is no ending. Looks like someone just halfway decided to end the series.",
        "Must watch this anime! Its freaking good. I wish there was season2 too",
        "The center of this anime is love, If you want to watch the story about a girl and boy's journey of union it's for you and Usui who is the main male character is so hot! Even he was selected as hottest anime guy once. I love Usui Takumi and Misaki as a couple.",
        "What an amazing anime. This is literally what got me into romance anime, initially i didn't think that genre was for me but i was wrong!! Maid sama is the best!!!!!! Such a cute story and so funny ugh i'm obsessed. So yes you should 100% watch it.",
        "This show is a very fun, cliche, heartwarming romance show. Lots of comedy, no major drama. Just a fun to watch show. This anime follows Misaki Ayuzawa, a very strong willed class president. She has a short temper, and mostly every boy is scared of her because of her shocking masculinity. She's very strong and very scary. Although she may show her strong side, she is very vulnerable when it comes to personal matters. Her family is in debt, and she has to work in a maid cafe! She has to keep this a secret, until she accidentally bumps in to the most popular boy in school Usui Takami. From here, Usui blackmails Misaki to doing things for him, so he can keep her secret safe. And there, one of the greatest anime couples had been created. The major cliched Usui, handsome, smart, strong. Finds a tsundere girl, who's also strong, yet he always gets on her nerves. The moments are heartwarming and at the end of the show, you just want to see more. The ending was very satisfying at the least. However, it's a much watch if you have just started watching anime. It's fun, romantic and funny, and you just will learn to love this show. It's fantastic and deserves recognition, as people in Japan had hated the manga due to its sexist remarks on girls. Although, this may be true in some implications, if you ignore those faults, you will have a new favourite to add to your anime collection.",
        "This story quickly worked it's way to one of my favorite animes of all time. It's not only extremely captivating from the first episode to the last, it also has amazing character development that left me feeling connected to the characters, even the ones who didn't appear in every episode. I recommend this to any romantic out there who enjoys a good laugh and plenty of fangirl moments. I hope you love it as much as I have.",
        "I can watch this over and over. It would be nice for another season \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",
        "I didn't like how creepy, stalkery, and possessive Usui was, it really gave off the vibe that this anime was way older than it is. I liked him in the beginning but as the series went on his character became more and more gross and intolerable. The only redeeming thing about this show for me was the strong female lead and the cute side characters.",
        "This anime is just perfect if you are looking for something light yet strong. Gripping to your heart and making you laugh on the floor. All the characters in this anime are awesome. Character development of some chracters are great. Scenes of USUI and MISAKI will make you yearn for romance like them. Their serious scenes turning into comedy suddenly will surprise you. You won't even expect what will become a laughing stock next. This anime is seriously worthy of watching atleast once. ONE OF THE BEST OF SHOUJO GENRE. Must for shoujo lovers. This the second anime that I had watched when I first started watching animes and believe me , it made me hooked into it until I finished it. Those 24 or 25 episodes of comedy, romance, confidence, energy, emotion, made me super love it. It's been 10 years it released and still I watch this series sometimes. I have watched this at least 5 times till now. Go for it!\nHowever if you are looking for something SERIOUS things , then I guess you might get annoyed but still give it a try.",
        "Feminist main character with the BEST most patient and funny love interest. Seriously, Misaki totally doesn't see what a gem she has until the last episode.Usui is incredibly handsome, kind, funny, and infatuated with Misa. He puts up with her constant berating so well.Hilarious plot and premise, exceedingly well done in terms of art style, voice acting, and plot. Pacing seems a little slow overall but I think the buildup is intentionally long, because it's their first real love.The only reason I give it 8 is because Misa is tsudere to the max, and at times totally unlikable. At least she's always sweet to females, and looks cute when she's angry.",
        "Kaichou-wa maid-sama follows the story of a high school girl named Ayuazawa Misaki who is the president of Seika High School which used to be an all boys school.Now that the school is starting to fill up with girls Ayuzawa strives to restore the balance between the students in order for the girls to be settled up with no problems.And there is Usui Takumi,a seventeen-year-old boy who seems to stalk Misaki around until he finds out that she works part-time in a maid-cafe something that she thinks it's urgent to be kept secret.As I stated before in this review,this is definitely my favorite romance/comedy anime of all time.I have watched a fair amount of anime in the same genre like Special A,Toradora etc. but none of those captivated me as much as this one.To become more specific, each and every episode never fails to deliver lots of humor while still keeping the romance at a decent level.The dialogue is so well- done conveying a lot of emotions to the viewers from happiness to sadness to disappointment.Secondly, although the romance may seem exaggerated sometimes, it still makes you swoon so MUCH!SO MUCH SWOONING GUYS!While,I do get there are stereotypes throughout the anime like the tall blonde PERFECT guy( aka Usui Takumi)I think most of us are suckers for things like this because a series is not supposed to present something completely compiled from reality.Lastly,the aspect of this story that I am inclined to believe I enjoy the most are the characters. Misaki is such a great female protagonist setting a great example for young girls whereas Usui is your number one FICTIONAL BOYFRIEND! 10/10 would recommend this anime!"

    "Durarara!!": [
        "This series is made by the same people who brought us the excellent Baccano! and it shows; like the earlier series it features a large cast of characters whose relationship to each other is not immediately obvious and there is also a supernatural element to the story. There are major differences too; this is set in modern day Japan and follows a far more linear structure, the level of violence is lower too making this suitable for a less squeamish audience.Mikado Ryugamine has moved from the countryside to a suburb of Tokyo where he is reunited with his childhood friend Masaomi Kida. Here he is introduced to the various characters and told which of the areas inhabitants he should stay away from; not surprisingly these are the very people the two protagonists get involved with. As the story progresses they come across a headless motorcyclist who is searching for her head, a black Russian sushi seller, a man with unnatural strength and an information broker who likes manipulating people. Into this mix there three gangs and a mysterious slasher can be added. As the various plots are worked out the two male protagonists along with Anri Sonohara, a girl from their class, get in a variety of scrapes and reveal many secrets that I won't spoil here.I really enjoyed this series; it was packed full of interesting characters and even though I had a little difficulty remembering all the names they were animated in a way that made it easy to know who was who. Talking of the animation; I thought it looked really good, the main characters were distinctive and interestingly all the background people were grey so in crowd scenes the viewer knows who to watch. I found the stories to be interesting enough for me to want to watch the next episode as soon as I could. As well of containing plenty of thrills there were also quite a few laughs to be had. Fans of Baccano! will be pleased to spot a few references to it along with an amusing cameo from Isaac and Miria! These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "\"Durarara!!\" is the story of a boy who came to the big city with hopes of escaping his boring and ordinary life, as he encounters many extraordinary people and strange events in the big city that is Ikebukuro.The photo-realism of the background and simplicity of the characters generated a unique atmosphere for this series.The background has extreme detail, with enough deliberate flaws (such as fading street lines, stained asphalt, individually colored bricks etc) and natural reflection of light to make them seem more than just drawings. What makes them seem even more realistic is that certain locales are exact reenactment of the actual city. The JR station in the first episode, for example even used JR's actual, un-altered logo. There were many other scenes where I actually recognized the backgrounds, and even the stores like Tokyu Hands and Wendy's had the original logo designs with minimal alteration in spellings.The background characters (or extras, if this was live action) were sketchy outlines. I personally don't like this technique being overused throughout the series, but as usual, it worked very well in certain scenes to show the busyness of the city and one's insignificance in society. Of course, it also brings out the main characters.I would say there was very little room for improvement in animation considering the atmosphere they were trying to create. Although there could've been a lot more surreal scenes.Voice acting done very well, especially for Kida, whose voice was somewhat unique and showed massive variance from when he's serious to joking. The entire cast were noticeably motivated. You can tell they gave everything they've got, especially in dramatic scenes.This may be a personal opinion, but I firmly believe a seiyuu's skill is measured by quality of his/her narration. It's something that you can't BS through, and truly talented voice actors are capable of moving the audience by subtly expressing emotion in seemingly unemotional dialogs. \"Durarara!!\" had different narrators for almost every single episode, and I feel I really connected with almost every characters by the end of the show.Music score was pretty good, often essential in setting the atmosphere. There was a particular clown-ish, jovial piece that really impressed me.This may be a bit harsh since we live in an era where everything's been done before and recycled plot lines are hard to avoid, but the story of \"Durarara!!\" is like a bunch of previous Japanese works patched together.Unveiling of the characters and exploration of loneliness in Tokyo in first half, as well as the intertwining events/lives and search for the exciting life is a carbon copy of 2009 film \"Lala Pipo\" (based on 2005 novel). This may be excused since this series was produced by many of the same staff from \"Baccano!\", but the similarity was disturbing.The general atmosphere and gang war aspect in the second half is almost identical to the infamous dorama \"Ikebukuro West Gate Park\" (IWGP). In fact, the main color gang even had yellow identification color just like IWGP, so was the gang leader's jester personality and Heiwajima Shizuo as the invincible fighter (though he's in different gang and strength was significantly beefed up).Then you have Orihara Izaya, who's pulling strings from behind the scenes like controlling chess pieces, much like the duo from \"Death Note\".Individual segments of the components may be unoriginal, but they were fused well together to make a story as a whole. The entire show had a consistent atmosphere and pacing, and surprisingly, the modernized Dullahan didn't seem to be forced into the story.The ending was slightly disappointing for me, since everything worked out too well. It felt like they were trying too hard to make an 'everyone's happy' ending. Fortunately, we can expect much darker story if they ever decide to make a sequel, judging from plot synopses of following novels.Characters are the most intriguing part of this series.The protagonist is Ryuugamine Mikado, seemingly an ordinary boy who's curious about everything about the big city he moved into for high school. Other than his super-cool name and secret background, I would say that he is THE Mr. Average, even that he doesn't have a personality since he's so bland.Like \"Baccano!\" there are many main characters with nearly equal screen time, each of them with unique backgrounds and interests that eventually converge. (Amazing use of cameo and that particular episode was the highlight of the series too.) The most interesting of such characters were Celty and Heiwajima. Celty Sturluson represents the mystique this big city Ikebukuro has to offer. Other than having kick ass 'horse' and method of communication, her character was the most complex out of all the cast in the series, ironically making her the most human out of all. Then you have Heiwajima Shizuo on the other side of the scale. Despite the fact that he is a human being, his monstrous power is just absurd with attention span of a child and serious temper tantrums. He's like the coolest walking destruction.Most of the story focuses on the unveiling of the characters' unique backgrounds and secrets rather than actual development.\"Durarara!!\" attempts to explore a large number of extremely common themes in Japanese media such as personal barrier, search for meaning in life, violence as a form of love, responsibility as leader etc, but none particularly as in-depth as they could've been.It is still the series that left me the most lasting impression this season though, with unique animation, sounds, and characters. The story lacked focus, but the pacing was excellent and kept me interested throughout the 24 episodes. Those who liked \"Baccano!\" and \"IWGP\" will most likely to enjoy \"Durarara!!\".What this series had, was the magic, and I will definitely watch the sequel if it ever comes out.",
        "\"Ikebukuro\", though it is a city, differs from Shinjuku with its prominent business district dominated by towering metallic skyscrapers and its pulsating entertainment district that swallows up all sorts of bars, karaoke, restaurants, and adult entertainment businesses. Ikebukuro also differs from Shibuya, the glittering city, which attracts hordes of young people with its. It is one of the three biggest sub-centers and yet remains somewhat nostalgic forest of neon. It's a waypoint for the residents of Saitama prefecture to be able to easily feel the Tokyo-like atmosphere. Therefore, I call it the \"Saitama Stopper\". Also, it is my town that I grew up in.\"Durarara\" is an ensemble story with an animated TV series based on the light-novel*. Its 24 episodes were televised between January and June 2010. Set in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, the story is made up of the episodes with a blend of interesting characters such as; the Headless Rider, the color gangs, the information dealer, the underground doctor, Yakuza and the Slasher . What astonished me was that the reproduction of Ikebukuro is amazingly accurate with the exception of the fictitious sushi restaurant and the hospital used as one of the core factors, so it can instantly be recalled for those who are familiar with Ikebukuro which is the original setting. And there are the characters' model as if it reverses their precise depictions. As likely scenes depicted in Ikebukuro along with the outstanding characters, it makes you feel strange between reality and this fictional story.\"The Headless Rider\", Celty, who is a courier and seen as an urban legend in Ikebukuro. She takes her job from Shinra who is a genius underground doctor. As her head is lost, she can't remember part of her past, and besides without a mouth, her communication is made through a PDA or laptop. Mikado Rugamine, is a seemingly timid guy and comes to Tokyo introduced by his close friend, Masaomi Kida. The yellow scarves gang called \"Dollars\", with no color and no sense of purpose, created on the Net by Rugamine, just to satisfy his curiosity and to escape from his ordinary life. Against his speculation, the Dollars has become a power in Ikebukuro. Izaya Orihara, who loves people's unhappiness and distresses, who loves \"loves\", philosophy, and people-watching, and who is a mastermind based in Shinjuku. A violent man who hates violence (Shizuo Heiwazima). Anri Sonohara who is a quiet girl with big breasts and a twisted old memory. She shows her other face by created from her past. A strange Russian guy (Simon). A guy who is fascinated by a beautiful head, and a girl who has changed her face because of her obsession towards him. Shinra's father wearing a gas mask all the time because of the dirty air of the city.The battle behind the scenes between the Dollars and their perennial nemesis, the Blue Square. A chatroom where no one knows their real faces, yet they exchange information. Truth and falsity. A hidden past behind the lost head. The true love recognized as a false love. While being a mixture of each character's story, the time when the true features of the Dollars, the Headless Rider and the magical sword are revealed, it is melted into the hidden past.It's a story with a lots of humor and full of entertainment.",
        "This is a series where the creators attempted to do a lot, and they shouldn't have - they did too much. There are many things happening, many characters with many backgrounds that have many problems, and the series is just incapable of resolving them all. Making a story with this many diverse elements in it is a problem because in order to make sense out of everything - why are the people like that, why do they do what they do, where is this all gong - you have to tell much more story, develop the characters much more deeply, and let the viewers get attached to those characters and what is happening in the storyline. They didn't do that here, and gave us lots of characters, plots, motivations, & actions - basically a city of people interacting - so that what you get is a hodgepodge of elements occurring that are painted broadly and lightly, without the time it would take for the viewer to care about what's going on or to know the characters well enough to become emotionally involved with them.The characters don't ever really get deeply involved with each other, but occasionally the authors ATTEMPT to have them do that, sort of promising that, but they never truly get there. In having so many stories revolving around each other, none of them is ever explore adequately, and we are always left hanging with \"almosts.\" It's as if the creators are are afraid to have their characters bond with each other and show those powerful emotions that would be normal in situations like that.The animation is fair, certainly not overwhelming, the artwork & coloration okay, & the music inappropriate, like something out of a \"Peanuts\" cartoon, all of this giving us this once-upon-a-time random cityscape of young characters.So, in the whole, as an animated piece which generally & sparsely depicts some occurrences in this particular city, it has some interest; but, too much talk, too many side issues which take away from having a main story, & too little character development to get one emotionally involved. Watch it, but do so lightly.",
        "I love the first opening and lost myself completely in the huge durarara universe while looking. Awesome",
        "Must Watch its really good! It is really good and funny, with lots of plot twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",
        "Amazing anime with really good action scenes. The humor is just a plus but the story itself is amazing and everything is tied in even though how different the characters are from each other.",
        "I truly don't understand how this show has been so well received. I almost stopped watching completely, multiple times, simply due to the horrid soundtrack alone, but it was recommended to me by a friend, so I held on and finished the show...and was left with basically nothing at the end.The writing was mediocre at best. The plot builds up a confusing and dull sense of strife by throwing the characters into a half sci-fi half punk gang war, while completely ignoring Celty's story that was built up in the first half of the season. It's like they completely forgot about her in the second half. None of the \"special\" character's powers were truly explained, or given a detailed back story, so we're left confused about that, not only throughout the show, but even at the end (as nothing is really tied up at the end). This issue is also the same for the main villain. There's no explanation as to why he's there or what his motive is, other than some obscure allusion to his \"love of humans,\" which is vague and unsatisfying.Everything about this show except the art and the voice acting was simply unsatisfying. It wasn't good, and it wasn't terrible, it was just...meh. Nothing stuck, nothing felt complete, and nothing felt valuable. None of the characters really mattered to me, except maybe Celty in the first half while her story was being told. The story telling for every other character was so sporadic and choppy that I found myself simply not caring, or being too confused to care.I probably would've given at least +2 more stars if it weren't for that god awful soundtrack. Music is supposed to flow well with, and enhance, the emotion of the story that is being told. Half the time, all this music did was distract and annoy.",
        "This anime is like a puzzle when all the pieces come together you feel a sense of accomplishment and it just feels so right but seriously this anime is awsome and makes you really think and make theory's and they don't always tell it in order but all in all it's a very good show with good characters and good character development"

    "The Tatami Galaxy": [
        "This anime series is centred on an unnamed college student in Kyoto who feels that he has wasted his time there; he has no girlfriend and he has made only two friends' Ozo, who has no redeemable features, and first year student Ms. Akashi. One night he meets a god who tells him that Akashi will end up with either Ozo or our protagonist. He just has to grab the opportunity dangling in front of him. Our protagonist finds himself reliving the previous two years; each time making different choices, such as joining different clubs.If you think all anime look the same then this will disprove that idea. The character designs and backgrounds are unlike any other series I recall watching, and I've watched quite a few. The story might sound repetitive but, while there are recurring events, each episode has more differences... and the similar moments prove humorous for the most part. There is a fairly small main cast but they are fun characters; our protagonist is the closest to a normal person. Ozo is strange, both in actions and appearance, he also provides much of the amusement. This series won't be for everybody but I'd certainly recommend it to anime fans looking for something different.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I just thought the whole thing was rather boring because it was rather too complex to understand what's going on. The art wasnt that great either, it was actually rather sloppy and all over the shop which is likewise to its storyline.I probably am going to be the only one that doesn't like this anime since I've seen positively great reviews on here as well also seen on MyAnimelist . Hey I'm not stopping anyone to not love this anime but it's just a pity that it didn't click with me, that's all..",
        "7 minutes of the first episode I was able to endure of this incomprehensible, pretentious, fugly mess of the worst spieces, hands down the worst piece of animation I've ever experienced in my whole life. Angel Cop, Lain, Princess Arete and Mononoke can hold their beer to this...this...I don't have words to describe it, except maybe for absolute monstruosity, monstruosity that makes even the works of Ralph Bakshi look like masterpieces of animation in comparison. And guess what? Exactly like Lain and Mononoke, this is Uberoverrated by anime lovers for no real reason at all. What a surprise! Total eye and ear torture that I don't recommend to anyone. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, AND I MEAN ALL COSTS.",

        "The Tatami Galaxy is really unlike any anime you've seen. Not necessarily in it's premise, but in the way it's executed.The Tatami Galaxy follows the story of an unnamed protagonist who meets a demi-god of love and matchmaking at a strange ramen restaurant. Over the course of many tries, the protagonist relives the same two years over and over again, trying to find the \"rose tinted college life\" he dreams of. He tries out different clubs, has to deal with his only friend Ozu who is basically the worst person alive, always attempting and chickening out to ask out the same girl he has a crush on. You know, college life.Although it's somewhat episodic, the show cleverly wraps all the episodes up into a cool storyline that makes every episode relevant and unique. We learn more about characters that you originally believe were background characters, and learn that the characters we see on screen have a lot more to them than what meets the eye.If I were to really talk about what makes this show so special, that would actually end up spoiling it. So you just have to trust me on this one. This show is incredible and it's not that long so give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",
        "To a common viewer, the anime might be found a bit weird in the first glance, firstly due to the quick narration of the protagonist character 'Watashi', and the unique and liberal art style.The story might seem to have a lot of repeating scenes in the initial episodes for the viewer, but then again the story basically follows the concept of parallel universes to support it.I can assure you the story builds up pretty intense and captivating in the later episodes. The ending is very justified to personal opinion, and worth the time of viewing the 11 episodes to the end.Genres include - psychological, slice of life and romance.For an anime like The Tatami Galaxy, I would've given a review of 8, or 9 at best. Factors like - witty and unique direction, the unexpected flow of the storyline, working the anime in a lower budget (due to numerous real-video scenes), and good anime opening/ending have earned it a 10 from self.It wouldn't be hard for anime enthusiasts to complete the 11 episodes.For common viewers, do give this show a scrutiny till the end. Assurance that the conclusions are to the worth.",
        "The tatami galaxy has one of the most beautiful art style I have ever seen in anime. The art style is enough to make this anime worth watching. But art style is not the only good thing about this anime.The tatami galaxy has a very weird storyline. Sometimes it gets confusing. But don't worry, you will understand everything in the end.Some characters are weird but almost every character is likable.The only problem I have with this anime is that the main character talks very fast.The songs are good.The tatami galaxy will be a treat for your eyes. And in the end it'll teach you something. Please watch it.Now give me 1000 yen\ud83d\ude02",

        "'The Tatami Galaxy,' based on a novel by Tomihiko Morimi and directed by Masaaki Yuasa, is a high-concept YA mini-series with an intriguingly bizarre premise: a young nameless student arrives at college with high hopes of experiencing an idealized \"rose-colored campus life,\" joins an activity circle that he eventually becomes disillusioned with when it fails to lead to his ideal college life, gets mixed up in a series of ludicrous situations, and finally wishes to start over and join a different activity circle, causing time to rewind and prompting him to start over again. However, choosing a different activity makes no difference, as the protagonist gets bogged down by the same disappointments, gets embroiled in escapades with the same level of lunacy, and even gets faced with the same eccentric cast of characters.The protagonist's constant striving and failing to achieve his desired lifestyle gives the show a quirky and darkly humorous streak that also comes across as nihilistic. It also gives the show a vehicle through which to deliver its central themes.'The Tatami Galaxy' is a show that warns its viewers to not expect too much and to embrace what they get instead. This is showcased through the journey of the nameless student. Every time the intellectual youngster goes back in time and redoes his first two years at college, he fails to recognize many of the good things that made up those two years due to his arrogance in pursuing the perfect life.The show also relies heavily on an atmosphere of loss and the sense that something is missing or missed out on. This sense of incompletion is ever-present in the protagonist and his escapades as he completely misses all that made his life at college precious. Likewise, viewers of the show experience the feeling that they have missed something as 'The Tatami Galaxy' is an extremely fast-paced show where every episode flies by in blink-and-you'll-miss-it moments (and blink-and-you'll-miss-it subtitles), so fast that two years of the protagonist's life go by in 22 minutes! This rapid-fire pace is concurrent with another core theme of 'The Tatami Galaxy.' The speed of the show emphasizes the fact that life doesn't stop for anyone (even if one can go back in time and relive his last two years), so one must appreciate and enjoy those amazing moments while they last. As Ferris Bueller once said, \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"Life does move fast in 'The Tatami Galaxy,' and every moment that flies by in each episode is unlike anything ever seen. From a bike-stealing agency whose sole purpose is to spoil one's day to a lifelong war of pranks between a zen-like super senior and a lecherous club president to a love doll that gets treated as a real person by any individual who comes across it, every episode of 'The Tatami Galaxy' is chockful of creative absurdities that make for an entertaining experience. It embraces weirdness while remaining grounded in the ugliness of human error, all the while reminding viewers that they are capable of avoiding the same mistakes and enjoying life for what it is. It is an enjoyable show, and I recommend it for anyone looking for something different to watch.",
        "Its truly a masterpiece .. got to say that it is hard to follow and understand .. but thats what makes it more beautiful and worth watching .. 8.9/10 but I'll give a 10 since Im seeing that a lot of trifles are getting higher ratings.",
        "Note: this is from a video review, look for links on my profile page.TG aims to overwhelm with symbolic metaphors, complexly dense in so little time, it is akin to a puzzle that runs like clockwork. This very ending is a representation of how the mind can categorize, how\none tatami mat goes into the next to form the shell of a larger structure, a macrocosm of the final story, each square correlated with the narrative of\ninterconnected characters prior in time.Even though they are relatively simple geometry it questions concepts;\nlyrically, why does it seem to reference the symbol of a (kami) god? Is it just internal monologue, done in a softer tone than the haste of its counterpart in the series? Note the inversion between the normal ending and the one at the opening of the last episode, from a multitude of colours to a solitary blue, reality ends up upside-down (just as Ozu switches roles at the end) and the potentialities of history are conjured up like the flourishing infinities that lay before empty time. Higuchi at one point urges seeking out a circle among all the angled shapes, but none is found until the episodic prophetic opportunity is taken. And so it becomes one.A robot, symbolic not of heroism as in Masaaki's Ping Pong anime, but a shell that protects an introvert, that defends against the possibility of failure. The yellow carpet is present but so is the armour, the red sky indicative of an anguished subjectivity, but do automatons cry? Out of frustration time rewinds as the internal psyche of the protagonist clasps at a mental solution. At the beginning, tatami mats were the logical equivalent of disorderly rocks scattered among prehistoric imagination. How do societies evolve despite strife? Light contrasts darkness. How does a limited individual fit in?Real objects and a shadowed environment, stand in for their drawn counterparts to possibly convey the physicality of sensation, as the representation of geometry's sharper shapes. A subjectively interminable number of days are intertwined with past exploratory fictions. Mundane universality. A farrago of hallucinatory experiences reveal to oneself... the ideal other, which is sunnily yellow and as chimerical as his own individual attempts at impression. Purple is a state in between.Hanuki's pink may be her weird humour, his hypothetical allies relive illusory lives, green may represent youth just as Akashi is showered in the colour later on, but Higuchi is stereotypically wiser than that; fishing for words, randomly instinctive, calm as trees, his gut not withstanding.Jougasaki, Masaki may be representative of the director of a similar name, in reality an overgrown Ozu, fanning strife if possible. And so they go. These relationships tumble and rumble, but what is a social construct? How does a self interact with the other? How can a distance be closed and can they hear each other?What fortuity lay in cupboards? What a fluky ceiling. Metabolism, is it involved in rumination? An unveiling of a physical transformation, protein manifest, a palate of animated imagination. Hallowed ramen, feline oddities. A grey background.Ozu, is he indeed a multicoloured disruptor of dichromatic tennis courts, a drunk (?), an astronomical film splicer, a verdant dyer of shirts, or a nebulous component of some surreptitious institution. Chronicler of society, fountainhead of pyrotechnics, the Grinch? Enabler of perversity, an overcoated yokai hybrid (perhaps like Inuyasha?) who merely kindles the fiery passions of dalliances (or not).What is that which is forlorn? How could portals be pulverized? A flaxen contraption in a monochrome universe, this is an art of contrasts. An ashen, vacant firmament looms, but could Ozu be figurative of anthropoid romance? His phantasmic whistling may hint towards it, just doesn't help that it's with his friend's conjured up ideal.Where could a yellow (same make as the phone?) airship take us, the completion of an 'ultimate' fantasy? The green valleys of some ritualistic gates reveal Ozu's quixotic tour de force. But what shade of colour do both result in? The airship emoji could certainly be useful. Who is this onion-shaped Ozu, and what have they done to his grin? Well, he could try serenading his own literary creation. But who are these foolhardy mercenaries who meddle in affairs of the heart? And so, as batteries always do, right at that exact moment.Despair takes hold of the beard in this sphere of vacuity, but pasta it could relish along with quite an artistic alluvion, striding into a backwards movie, and finally the squid hybrid! Forty winks, of course, and a rave theoretically! An equine fictive binding, readying for a flick, and symbolic social engineering.This and more he invoked from a hypothetical time loop. Could one truly have such infinite space (despite the holes)? But how could this shell devoid of colour be remedied, how could hue be interposed between the self and the exterior?The canopy of an abode, moths someone fears, the hand flowed, nimble conceits, a spider's thread, material books' frontier, a Maromi symbol? A leafy, lush reality, this dreamy rhythm, the drawn and not so intermingling; a clear sight of what one forgot, an opportunity missed, carpe diem wrought, an airy figment, an alluring utopia.Might this be that orb of chance, this omnipresent express out of solipsism? Might this trance have been but a prance through fecund flights of fancy? This carriage ever-heading, an existential swaying; this marriage of planes, an engine of Lepidoptera. And I am out.TG excels not just at the little details, nor merely the amalgamation of reality and fantasy, not just with animation, but narratively too, that it is hard to fathom how both were created separately. How is it that mundane life, a monologue usually reserved for dreams, is given such a climactic adaptation? A breath of fresh air, a transition between realms, a kaleidoscopic vision. This series does so much in so few hours. It is a walking painting, an animated chameleon, it begs us to wonder at the spectacle, what could be if the arrow of time shifts, how does perception interact with the world? Is art ethereal? What cadence is surprise? Is language formless, and is life but a dream?",
        "My first review here, just like the other person who's reviewed this so far. I'll make it short. This is one of the greatest series I've ever seen. Minute for minute this was one of the most worthwhile watching experiences I've ever had, anime or not. The animation as absolutely beautiful, often including multiple mediums and styles, the main style being very stark drawings with very subdued subtle coloring and great animation, but also including highly stylized film-work on occasion, the occasional splash of 3d, another very vividly colored style, and a really odd sort of chalk-board looking style of cg for particular scenes. The story is an adaptation of a novel, and the visuals tell it in a way that never could've come through in novel form, which are the best kind of adaptations in my opinion, I'm very curious about the original novel though. I'll just go ahead and not cover any parts of the story, as you can find that many places, including here, and I'd rather not spoil any more for you. Watch this now! These 4 hours of TV will not be ones you feel like you wasted, permitting you enjoy good art.",
        "Tatami galaxy is one of these anime where everything falls into place In the end, I know you'll see the episodes and think that they are the same, but each one is more different than the last, if u pay close attention, by the last episode, it becomes clear what the writers are trying to tell you, and the art style is very unique and beautiful, a must watch for someone who likes unusual and well made shows.",
        "From time to time, I desire a show that will deliver a simple and grounded in reality plot in an unorthodox way with great success. Yes, you should already understand that Tatami Galaxy holds no need for superficial or amazing concepts to be successful, just a realistic story executed in a masterful way.Story : 10 / 10 \"Masterful\"Tatami Galaxy is set on a fictional universe, specifically a town, which seems pretty close to the modern Japanese towns. Our main character, Watashi, expects to find the rose colored campus life that he always dreamed of, entering a campus club. Instead, he finds mischief and disappointment in every way possible. Every time he joins a club, everything seem to go wrong and he ends up regretting his choice, wanting to go back to the moment of choosing it and reset his life by changing his choice. The plot is following his different choices and the different lives he lived after them. Watashi begins a journey of self- discovery, where the weight of his choices matters the most, becoming a matured young man who lives his life with unlimited freedom but also respect on every choice. Art : 9 / 10 \"Great\"The show uses a minimalistic style that combines cartoonish graphics with no shading with a lot of live action film segments used in for quick depiction of areas with lots of background detail. Seen as poor by many, the art of Tatami Galaxy is gravely underrated. It effectively depicts the themes of the show, taking a realistic approach on many problems that college students face in Japan. Furthermore, it becomes very interesting when adding the psychological symbolisms included in the show.Sound : 9 / 10 \"Great\"A testament to the superb voice acting could be that, even though Watashi's speech is faster than a bullet train, he still manages to keep the viewer in his toes with his smart (and funny) take on many different subjects and make him feel whatever emotion he emits. As for the soundtrack, it fits great with the theme and mood of the series, successfully representing the constant changes in atmosphere, from the melancholic \"Youjou han to Castella to Watashi\" to the mysterious \"Kamotaketsunuminogami\" and powerfully liberating \"Yojouhan Ki Owari\" or \"Takasegawa\".Characters : 9 / 10 \"Great\"From the bullet-speed monologues of Watashi to the stoic and spiritual presence of Higuchi, the cast is the recipe for instant success. Watashi is a young college dropout who never seizes to amaze with his sarcastic and dark but witty dialogues on everything he analyzes. He is the source of the dialogues and monologues in Tatami Galaxy, and his themes vary from social commentary to self - sarcasm of the highest caliber. Ozu is another college student, dark and devilish character, who constantly drags Watashi to troubles. However, he has some hidden aspects which make him intriguing and three-dimensional. Akashi, a college student in the engineering department, is an adorable female character, and Watashi's biggest love interest. Higuchi is a stoic, and full with dreams on exploring the globe, character who is still a college student, even though he ,by far, had exceeded the minimum years of studying there. He also has many hidden sides, which made him mysterious, spiritual and occasionally wise. There are more characters that are also very interesting, but doesn't quite measure up to the other mentioned above. However, there is not a single character that is not likable in this series, because of his quirks and personality.Enjoyment : 10 / 10 \"Masterful\"I fully enjoyed every minute of Watashi's attempts to reach a rose- colored campus life, his moments of self-discovery and liberation scenes. Verdict : 9.4 / 10 \"Excellent\"When simple but meaningful premises meets innovative and unique storytelling methods, a show like Tatami Galaxy is born. Excluding or changing only one component of the Tatami Galaxy's recipe would result in losing it's eternal glowing. There's nothing more boring than reading a review, so give yourself the chance to watch this exquisite show. You will not regret it.",
        "I'll tell you right now that I don't like anime. I never got into it and of the anime I've been exposed to, I felt the horrible overacting and ridiculous plots robbed the medium of anything worth watching. Now that I've seen The Tatami Galaxy, I'm forced to eat my words and consider it one of the greatest television shows of all time. It's an artistic powerhouse with great characters, clever writing, and an unmistakable artistic style.The art itself is admittedly what attracted me to the series. I've always been interested in avant-garde animation and this is one of the most beautifully animated shows of them all. I won't bore you with describing the style itself but needless to say it's incredibly unique and satisfying. Even if the writing was atrocious this would be a show worth watching on the animation alone. Luckily enough, it isn't the only great thing about the series. The story keeps reeling you back in time and time again until before you know it, it's all over.The plot is simple -- an unnamed protagonist recollects his previous two years at university and, like most people, asks whether or not doing something different would lead him to a better position for his 3rd year. For the protagonist, this is often culminated in joining a different club or choosing to pursue a different girl than he previously had, and the series explores what alternative possibilities arise when these choices are made. Imagine \"Groundhog Day\" or \"Lola Rennt\" with the wonders and curiosity of a misfit underclassmen.The show presents itself as an outstanding stand-alone project with a clear story structure. Even though each episode is essentially revisiting the same kind of conflict and resolution, the differences are fresh enough to surprise you every time. Every episode starts with the protagonist complaining about how he came as a freshmen looking for that \"rose coloured\" (romantic, idealized) campus life complete with a raven-haired maiden, and every episode ends with him asking himself if he had only done something different, wouldn't he have gotten what he'd came to university in search of? This formula allows for seemingly minute details and background characters to re-appear in genuinely novel and surprising ways throughout the duration of the series. The writing is astounding to say the least and you'll find yourself watching the series again and again noticing every time a couple of new things which either foreshadow or reference that which you hadn't seen before. It's not usual that such a limited run series can offer so much on repeated viewings.The ending is one of the best finales of all time. It ties every loose end up in a way that I would have never expected and feels incredibly satisfying. The last episode answers every question you have about the series, has a very clever twist, and leaves the protagonist with some proper insight and feeling when it's all said and done. It even choked me up a bit, which was probably the last thing I'd expect from a show that doesn't seem to take itself so seriously. The sentimentality and philosophy at the end really strikes a chord and leaves the viewer with insight on their own life decisions and how to come to grips with them.The most telling part about the show is that you don't end the series wishing there were more, rather, it's a perfectly self-contained package that covers all the ground it needs to without an inch too little or too much. Shows that are this well thought out from start to finish are so rare and few and far between I'm at a loss to even think of a comparable example.So all this excellence and nothing bad? The only thing negative to say is that the narrative is EXTREMELY fast in every episode so reading subtitles is pretty much as hard as it gets. The worst part about that being how hard it is to enjoy the art style without missing out on key dialogue and narration at the bottom of the screen. If you're patient, you can pause it when you need to or slow down the playback speed, but bear in mind the rapid pace plays very well into the animation style, and serves to \"cram\" a lot of content into each 22 minute episode. But if the pace were slower and each episode an hour long, the show would definitely lose its magic.In the end, I guess all I can say is to watch The Tatami Galaxy and see if you like it yourself. Give it at least a few episodes before you make a decision and believe me you'll be hooked. I cannot recommend it highly enough for those who like artsy animation, poignant but never overbearing themes, and the foibles of truly unique characters experiencing college life. Simply put, anime fan or not, this is one of the best shows you'll ever see.",
        "Well this is my first review...... here goes...A brief synopsis: Freshman Watashi(literally 'I' in Japanese) finds himself repeating his first 2 years in college with disastrous consequences over and over again, never seemingly realizing that he's repeating life making the same mistakes over and over.Based on a novel of the same name, \"Yoj\u014dhan Shinwa Taikei\", or literally \"4\u00bd Tatami Mythological Chronicles\" is perhaps the most innovative anime series I have ever seen..... the Groundhog Day of anime if you will. Masaaki Yuasa's (of Cat Soup and Mind Game fame, and if you haven't seen them go see it NOW!) Tatami Galaxy is one of a kind. The character designs are pretty distinct from standard anime conventions, and what caught my eye in the first place. I'm surprised more people don't know about this series, because it's a true GEM in covering what many people go through trying to fit into campus life. The humor is light hearted and genuine.... and the characters avoid falling into stereotypes, instead they turn out to be incredibly engrossing and believable. What's remarkable is how all the stories come together at the end, for a satisfying conclusion. Something which most anime end up trying to do unsuccessfully..... 11 episodes seem like too short a time spent in dealing with Watashi's life...but as the end makes it clear There's no point in continuing a story which has been resolved... a lesson which a few anime out there should realize by now...P.S. There are 3 7-min specials which were also released with the DVD, watch out for them too!My rating: An excellent series from start to finish, keep an eye out for small details in between the series. EVERYTHING ties up at the end :)",
        "Excellent from start to finish with beautiful animation with sometimes a combination of 2d, 3d and live action. The story being simple in concept but extremely enjoyably journey of self discovery and with my favorite conclusion to a story."

    "Princess Tutu": [
        "\"Princess Tutu\" is a very good anime series. The first time that I've heard about it, I thought that this was going to be a very bad series. But it was pretty good. This show is not a typical, cheesy magical girl series, but an interesting and original series instead. The atmosphere is dark and the characters are very complex, much more than I thought that they would be. Also the story was way darker and more violent than I thought that it was going to be from the beginning. But that was good; nothing is gratuitous or superfluous in this series: There is mystery, there is comedy and drama, and there are even occasional thrills. The character designs were very stylish and well made, and the use of classic music was simply beautiful. I'm not very much into magical girl series, or into anime in general, but I really liked this series. It was worth watching from beginning to end.",
        "I really thought this anime was very cute. Funny how most of the characters are human but we are also involving a cat who is a dance teacher threatening the young dancers to marry him if they don't do well and an ant-eater who wants to get dancing with the prince. You literally will laugh your head off and be like \"wtf mate\" LOL!! Seriously like this series is meant to be a mixture of fairy tales and yet, we have two animals appearing on this. Are they meant to be a reference to wind in the willows, puss in boots or some animal fairy-tale story relating to it? I'm not hating it but, it was just surprising that this anime included this to make us amazed! Anyways I really thought the prince was going to choose Duck because like she is the princess all along that helped him get his heart back. What were the writers thinking of getting the prince to choose a gorgeous Rue rather then be with Duck? It just doesn't make sense even though, Rue was good as a heroine but she deserved someone else then the prince to be honest. I really wish Duck and him were the ones that lived happily ever after instead of being friends.Good movie and music 8/10",
        "Don't let the title fool you into thinking this is a show solely meant for little girls; this is one of the best anime series you're liable to find period. It's like a fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Andersen meets the magical girl genre meets metafiction. There's many a plot twist and the characters are so well written. The animation and backgrounds are lovely, evocative of watercolor illustrations in a storybook.The first few episodes are a little slow (though still entertaining), but by the time you get past episode five, you'll be hooked until you reach the heartwrenching finale. If you love shoujo, fairy tales, ballet, or just well written stories in general, then this will be a welcome treat.",
        "Ahiru (Duck in the English dub) who is a duck turns into a girl in order to restore Mythos heart and his emotions. To this she becomes a magical girl called princess tutu. However, she must keep this a secret from her friend and not confess her love otherwise she may disappear. Also she must stop princess Crayhe fromThis I do feel is avery underrated anime which definitely deserves a lot more love and recognition.I really love the character this show had to offer and you do get to like them as well as the show goes along and the how much emotion the voice actor put in theme,I also the idea and the art work visulas were also amazing.",
        "Princess Tutu is ostensibly a shoujo magical girl series, from its name all the way down to its romantic quadrangle, and it fulfils the expectations of that genre wonderfully. But there's also an element of artistry that elevates it beyond simply being a well-done genre work. It's not just that the series wraps itself in high culture like ballet or literature -- it's that it actually manages to comment intelligently on these things while creating a beautiful visual work.Princess Tutu filters the usual magical girl narrative through the strange logic of fairy tales and a healthy coating of Utena-esque surrealism. As the series progresses, the story begins to fall apart in an intentional and revealing way, and things get increasingly metafictional. What results will be a delight to both anime fans looking for entertainment as well as postmodern aficionados like myself.There are a lot of relatively stand-alone episodes, and these tend to drag. I won't deny that the middle section of Princess Tutu bored me most of the time. But the end pulled it all back together, and it might have one of the best conclusions of any anime series I've watched. Don't be fooled by the silly title -- this show deserves to be taken seriously.",
        "When I first saw the trailer of this anime on a volume of Kaleido Star,it was kinda pretty. But after buying the first volume,and the other two, I really loved it. My favorite characters in this one are: Duck,and Miss Edel. I know Duck has what it takes to be a dancer,all she's got to do is believe in herself,and work hard to achieve that goal. I also like the opening theme as well. What this series tells us that we all have to face greater challenges that lie ahead of us.All we have to do is do our best,and not mess up.The show also features the great voice talents of Chris Patton,and Luci Christian(famous for Pretear),Jay Hickman,and others. I really think I'm going to like this anime and keep collecting it on DVD. So in closing,if you have seen the preview, then this is the one to get. You will see what I mean",
        "I Hated It. I never had a good feeling about Princess Tutu, even before I began properly watching it. When I saw the first episode that should've been my first hint. It creeped me out, but I wanted to give the show a fair try and after a few episodes it was entertaining. However, the second half of the series it becomes dull, boring and even more creepy and scary than the first episode. Ultimately I strongly dislike the anime and would NOT recommend it to anyone. Aside from the major creep factor, another reason I dislike this anime was the romances. I didn't feel any chemistry or love for any of the couple, including Duck and Fakir. I definitely saw a building relationship, but they came to realize their true feelings and Rue and Mytho were the most boring couple ever. They repeated the same thing over and over, basically treating him as a puppet boyfriend.Overall, I hated the series. It was dull, creepy, boring and the ending was beyond depressing. Worst Anime Ever!!!! Don't Watch It. I Repeat. Don't Watch It.",
        "I am a huge fan of the magical girl genre and this anime did not disapoint. It was fun, magical but also had a more serious and dark side, which I did not expect. But it was such a nice suprise. I enjoyed almost every single character, beautiful scenes, especially when it comes to the dance scenes. I loved how it took the forbidden love but it made it into something so much more. The only thing I didn't really like was the pair choices, especially in the ending. The ending was the worst part. Everyone got a happy ending exept Duck (the main character), but it was made to seem like she did?? Idk, didnt really make sense to me. But despite the ending, this series was still amazing, would be a 10/10 if not the ending.",
        "It's cool because it's about a storyteller's tales that continue to exist beyond his death. In the tales, there is a ballerina who turns into a duck when she gets low self esteem, especially over a boy. She has to go to a body of water to become human again every time. Then there are these other characters who are anthropomorphic ballet students. The teacher is a cat in a jogging suit who threatens to marry everyone. It's great because it is unique, weird, and far out. By the title, people would think it's mostly for girls, but it's not if you know the plot. It's one of these cool animes that hasn't been released to the USA on DVD. If it is already, I'll be ready to pounce on the DVD and claim it as mine.Edit: I have the series now, and I continue to enjoy this brilliant anime.",
        "Though at times it's a bit cheesy, it's a fun mashup of ballet and anime. Nothing terribly deep or life changing. Just magical storytelling that allows you to get lost for a while. Some wonderful characters too. Now, I'd love to see a mashup of Cirque du Soleil music and storytelling, and anime as a second season.",
        "To be honest, while I'm not huge on this genre, there are magical girl anime I do enjoy. Lets make one thing clear; Princess Tutu is not just the worst magical girl anime I've ever seen, it is the worst anime I've ever seen PERIOD!!!The reason for why this anime is bad is simple, it's all over the place, the dubbing and art direction even for 2002 look horrible, in fact there are anime prior to the twenty first century that look better then this, and the characters are just archetypes with no defying character traits that flesh them out. I can't say I like these characters, because these characters aren't identifiable. They're so one note and leaves me questioning why they're even here. Not even the intro makes that much sense about a man dying and a prince and raven fighting for all eternity or something. This anime is inconsistent and the world just makes no sense whatsoever and dialog that will leave you questioning just what exactly is going on? If you want good magical girl anime or just the anime genre as a whole, this is something you should avoid. With something as a reused concept from other anime as this and a story that's not that well written, you'll leave this anime asking what did you just watch. Stay away from Princess Tutu and go watch something else",
        "I'll be honest: I first thought this wouldn't be any different from any other typical magical girl story (With battles, nasty witches, bright pink magic makeup,...). I even found it a little redundant at times. Still, all along its progression, the protagonists slowly diverge towards different directions and new elements add to the confusion and interrogations, while a puppet master takes a malicious pleasure watching the events from the outside. The not so clear demarcation between illusion and reality, the central role of ballet and the classical background music add to the series' originality with sensitivity. The suspense and tragedy build up exponentially the last few episodes, with an interesting ending.",
        "I watched this with all of my siblings and we all love it so much. Duck and Fakir are so cute! I love the story.",
        "This was the first anime I ever watched and it is arguably stranger than even most anime series. But I was hooked from the start. The unique plot elements and characters gradually clarify into a truly thoughtful plot. I have heard some people say that this anime is just too weird, but the \"wierdness\" actually has reasonable explanations within the story that lead to a much more fulfilling experience than if everything was understandable from the beginning. The story is actually a meta-fiction that explores story archetypes, free-will and predestination, and true sacrificial love. All the lovely ballet sequences and references are just icing on the cake. It is also very funny with plenty of opportunities for fan-girling over the leads (Fakia<3!). \"Princess Tutu\" is probably not a very inspiring title to those looking for a quality show. However, I encourage you to look past the odd name as well as the odd first couple of episodes. This show has real heart and a wonderful plot that will take you so much deeper than a typical magical girl anime.",
        "Princess tutu is a really funny anime about a duck who can turn into a girl when wearing a magical pendant,that also allows her to turn into a ballet dancing heroine! Duck in girl form is a funny unsuccessful dancer,and her and her classmates are constantly threatened by their dance teacher (Mr.cat or Neko-sensai) into marriage....very funny! Definitely worth watching,story line:Drosselmeyer,a famous writer starts writing stories,that legitimately makes the stories come true,scared of bad things coming from this power,the town's people cut off his hands to prevent him from writing stories,his hands were cut off,before the end of one story in particular,named: The Prince and The Raven. Each episode introduces another story(ballet shows) including Don Quixote,Sylphide and other classics.Duck has a crush on a boy name Mytho,who's heart was shattered (he is the prince from the unfinished book)and Fakir,a direct relation to Drosselmeyer possesses the same power as Drosselmeyer,that of whatever is written becomes reality.The anime is one the best I have ever seen,and would recommend it to any ballet/anime fan!",
        "*minor spoilers*A lot of people have said that Princess Tutu is not what it looks like. It's not as girly as it sounds. Don't judge a book by its cover. Well\u0085 I actually disagree with this. In many respects, Princess Tutu is exactly what you might expect. It's a magical girl fairy tale with romance, ballet, a female lead, and a big bad villain who wants to ruin everything for the protagonist and keep her from her true love and there are several points that might make you feel like you're watching a classic Disney Princess movie. BUT! I do not think that should stop you from watching this. Princess Tutu is truly a hidden gem. I had a lot of fun with this anime and I honestly think anyone of any age, man or woman can still love this show.Princess Tutu in a nutshell is a story of a story. Once upon a time a man wrote a story of a prince who fought against an evil raven. During their battle the two managed to literally come out of the story and into real life. Eventually the prince prevailed and managed to lock the evil raven away forever. However, in the process he had to shatter his own heart in order to do so. Thus leaving him emotionless. Skip ahead to the present and we find that all the characters of the story now reside peacefully in a small town where they all attend a ballet school. This is where our main protagonist comes in. Ahiru. Who's name literally translates to \"duck\" Which makes sense since she herself is in fact a duck who through the power of a pendent is able to take on the form of a human girl and it is her role in the story to collect and return the shattered fragments of the prince's heart. At the same time our main antagonist Princess Kraehe attempts to prevent the prince from regaining his heart while also trying to free her father the raven.This is definitely one of the more unique stories I have heard among fairy tales and while it may sound like just another typical fairy tale, the story's execution is fantastic and it tells itself in a very realistic way and there were never any moments that felt too sappy, cheesy, or sugar coated. The story is exceptionally well written and contains a perfect blend of comedy, romance, drama, and even some dark epic moments.The characters were definitely the highlight of this show for me. This show focuses mostly on five main characters and I immediately fell in love with all of them.Ahiru/Princess Tutu \u2013 Our goofy, kind and caring protagonist who's only real desire is to restore the prince's heart as she wants nothing more than simply to see him smile.Mytho \u2013 The prince of the story who having lost his heart is left with no emotions or even any understanding of emotions.Fakir \u2013 The knight of the story dedicated to protecting Mytho and doing what he believes is best for him though at times he comes off as very controlling.Rue/Princess Kraehe \u2013 The primary antagonist of the story. Also in love with Mytho, she hopes to prevent Mytho from regaining his heart and is constantly getting between him and Ahiru.Drosselmeyer \u2013 The writer of the story of \"The Prince and The Raven\". Having died, he now resides in another dimension where he watches over his tale as it unfolds before him.The characters all act and feel very believable and they each have a good amount of depth and focus in the story. There is also great character development with not just the protagonist but with all the characters. As the story progresses and we learn more about the characters, some of them turn out to be quite different from who we originally thought they were and they develop very naturally throughout the course of the show. Even the villain goes through some growth. Every character is great and even the minor characters like Neko-sensei are very memorable. Because if you don't do well in Neko-sensei's class\u0085 He will have you marry him!Princess Tutu is a fairly old anime dating back to 2002 and as such it has the art style you would expect from an older show. Despite this, the art is quite good for its time. It is very suitable to the show and has a real charm to it that makes it quite pleasant to look at.Big fan of classical music? You'll love this show. The majority of the soundtrack consists of popular classical tunes. Mainly those from the Nutcracker and if there was ever an anime that used classical music well, it's Princess Tutu. The intro also has a very classical feel to it and goes great with the show. Same goes for the outro.As for the sub or dub debate, Princess Tutu has one of the better dubs I've seen. None of the voices sounded bad and Luci Christian was an excellent choice to play the role of Ahiru (or as she's called in the dub \"Duck\") The original version is also spectacular and is worth watching as well. Want to watch the Japanese version? Every voice fits PERFECTLY. Want to watch the dub? The voices still fit perfectly. So watch whichever version suits your tastes. Or if you have time, watch both!Princess Tutu is a highly under appreciated show that deserves far more attention than it gets. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. Definitely one of if not the best magical girl anime out there.",
        "Princess Tutu....One of the best shows ever! It shows compassion along with love. This series speaks to my heart and I can't wait till the next DVD comes out. Princess Tutu, I recommend it for everyone, It has such a beautiful story to it. If you don't watch this, your missing out on a lot. :):):) A Duck who wants to be a girl, and A girl who loves a boy, whom has no heart. A girl who wants to become Princess Tutu, the only one to restore his heart. If she ever confesses her love to him, she turns into a speck of light and disappears. Should she keep her love feelings to herself and never speak of such feeling....or shall she speak and turn into a speck of light, with no returning once so ever. This show represents lots of feeling and compassion. Also, It shows that parts of life is about going through obstacles."

    "Kino's Journey": [
        "This series is quite different to other anime series I've seen; it is neither action packed nor full of laughs although that doesn't mean it is totally lacking in these. The animation has a style of its own too; in some ways it has a simple look but it is stunningly beautiful. The series follows the travels of Kino and her talking 'Motorrad' (motorbike) Hermes as they visit various countries, each of the countries are effectively city states that each have their own unique customs, some are friendly, others less so. As a general rule Kino is just an observer of the countries she visits but occasionally gets involved although that is usually because she has no choice. Just because Kino prefers to avoid conflict does not mean the guns we see in the opening credits don't get used, it did come as a surprise the first time though.As they are constantly travelling the only regular characters are Kino and Hermes; Kino is an interesting character whose gender is open to question for the first few episodes and is sometimes addressed as a boy and sometimes as a girl in the various countries, Hermes might be a talking motorbike but isn't as silly as that sounds, it looks like a real bike and does not have a face like other animated talking vehicles.While the stories were gently paced I was never bored, I'd certainly recommend this for anybody looking for something a little different. It is suitable for most ages although one or two scenes might disturb young children; some people and a few rabbits do get shot and we aren't spared the sight of spilt blood.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "One of the reviewers here is right, this anime is way too slow paced and doesn't necessarily focus on a plot. I suppose it depends on your mood, my mood at the time watching this needed a breather but then it bored me quickly. I probably need more topics than just relaxation while watching an anime....",
        "Based on a Japanese light novel of the same name, we follow Kino, a traveller, and her talking motorcycle, Hermes, as they ride from country to country in a vast, sudo-futuristic world of many peoples and civilizations. Less of an overarching narrative or large scale world building, the core of Kino's Journey lies in each of its episodic visits to a new country, typically exploring some political or organizational ideal to its extremes, along with the moral lessons or implications we could learn should a society like it exist. The art style is quite strong, with crt scanlines superimposed over all its visuals, watercolour motifs through most of its backgrounds and scenery, especially when in nature, and the foregrounds washed out colours, giving that sort of punk aesthetic. I very much enjoyed it, the characters were all fantastic, although there was the odd bit of eye-rolling at some of the reveals or melodrama. There is also certainly violence and some tackling of heavy themes, so not for children. Definitely on the more grounded end of anime, I would highly recommend if it already seems something of interest, was good.",
        "KJ is structured much like Aesop's Fables. Each episode is a simplified cautionary tale of the foibles of human nature, particularly mankind's tendency to go to extremes. Kino inhabits a sparsely populated world - most likely a post-apocalyptic world, though that information is not divulged. Staying at each place for 3 days, she is exploring various lands with her talking \ud83c\udfcd, Hermes. Her first stop is a country in which the inhabitants thought they could eliminate pain if they all understood eachother better, so they all drank an elixir that would enable them to read eachother 's minds. Obviously, people separated, grew apart, isolated themselves, and now the population is dying out. No children are born as nobody can tolerate another's presence. Yes, it should have been obvious. The motif ends with non-verbal communication via expression alone that is eerily like mind reading.KJ is a 2003 release that is rated 8.29 on MAL. It is 1 season consisting of 13 24-minute English dubbed episodes with CC available. Several sources say it is 12 episodes. Hidive, on Prime, has 13 episodes to watch. There are offshoot productions that do not appear available for streaming currently: Sequel Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - Byouki no Kuni - For You; PrequelKino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - Nanika wo Suru Tame ni - Life Goes On; Alternative VersionKino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series; Side StoryKino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - Tou no Kuni - Free Lance; and CharacterDengeki Bunko 2007 Movie Festival Special.Episode 2 is bad@$$. In ep4 we get her backstory, and it's rough. The show feels ancient as these \"countries\" are much like ancient walled off cities. Every country/town she visits has people with foolish notions. Due to isolation, each country comes up with rather extreme and mostly untenable solutions to problems. Quite often these countries are somewhat ruthless and harsh. (Like a fable, it's not entirely make-believe, it mirrors reality). We'll see a threatening inspector explain through gritted teeth that every country has its customs and it's no outsider's business. Yet a traveler does step in to save the life of a girl, leaving the residents befuddled. In one country machines do all the work. Since resources are limited, they created useless jobs as a measure to divvy out these scarce resources: Those with the highest stress (useless) jobs get the most resources. And around and around we go. In a land where books are banned because \ud83d\udcda cause readers to get lost in illusions, we hear that \"All people exist in the illusion that \u00b0they\u00b0 are the main character.\" People get trapped in irony's cruel grip because nature always denies them the ability to truly be the main \ud83c\udfad. The solution? Escape by becoming an author. \"All I know is that no one sane would become an author,\" says Kino. My favorite philosophical discussion is Kino discussing man's-obligation-to-man with Hermes.The art supports the simplicity of the show. People are drawn at a 3/10 reality scale with little detail and some exaggeration, all fitting in with the fable setting. Backgrounds are closer to a 4/10 with simplified, minimized and stylized realism. Though simple, the art is plenty expressive, reinforcing the sounds and verbiage that increase the sense of wonder. Wonder as she wanders \ud83c\udfcdQUOTES\ud83d\udce2A traveler's most important asset is what helps you get back up after a struggle's left you so close to the end.The Critics: \"All they do is expound their store of knowledge.

        "Its a brilliant format to teach a bunch of philosophical concepts.\nEach country has its own philosophy, and the countries are all small. Kino travels from country to country, while the viewer gains a deeper understanding of the concept. The format is the best format I have ever seen in a TV show and it will always stay in my memories.",
        "Definitely a very slow paced anime, if you are looking for action you are at the wrong place.However, if you are interested in experiencing the elevating joys, the wide arsenal of emotions and artistic features an anime can offer then you have just found what you are looking for.This piece of art is coming at you with a mixture of sounds, pictures, and dialog like not much other anime out there. Every single episode is a rather complex assessment of the different systems that have existed and exist throughout human history and of the different element of human personality in general.Our main hero, Kino is a traveler and as such it is not the end point, not the destiny of the journey that is important for her, but the experience she gather while being on the road. Many of the episodes have not much connections to each other, they could be separated from each other and still be meaningful, in other words there are a lots of episodes (in the literature sense).It was created by the same crew as Serial Experiments Lain, so if you've seen that you should have a good idea what you are in for, however this one is taking a less theoretic approach to the different problems humanity as a whole and an individual is facing. Most importantly, each episode gives you a comprehensive example, that way getting the problem close to you and is looking for practical solutions. Still in the end the Kino takes no active part in the events and is just a bystander, who forms her opinion but does nothing more (maybe with exemption of 1-2 life-death problems she can't stand by).Summing up, to truly understand this piece you have to do your own part, this show doesn't serve you answers on a silver plate, but rather questions.",
        "Through the grapevine I had heard rumors of this very nice little 13 episode Anime called \"Kino's Journey\" (Kino no tabi). Reviews seemed to be mixed, but I picked up the first volume anyway and was immediately drawn in. The next day I ordered the final three volumes and waited patiently for them to arrive. I wasn't disappointed. Kino is a traveler. She spends her time traveling from country to country never spending more than three days in any one place. As a companion she only has Hermes, a talking \"Motorrad\" (German for Motorcycle). Between countries Kino and Hermes discuss philosophy and life on the road in a very Kerouac style. Interestingly, none of the insights are into the travelers lifestyle, but rather the little things that grace it almost as ornaments.For instance, Kino. Near the beginning of the first episode: \"A travelers most important asset is what helps you get back up after a struggle has left you so close to the end. I know it as luck.\"These statements are scattered randomly and regularly throughout the series, while each place she visits has some statement to make on some part of society. Sometimes those statements are subtle, and other times it's like being hit on the head with a baseball bat. As a rule, Kino doesn't get involved in the situations she comes across in these countries. However, we all know about rules and their exceptions!Stylistically, Director Ryutaro Nakamura is heavily influenced by Hayao Miyazaki (\"Spirited Away\", \"Kiki's Delivery Service\", \"Castle in the Sky\") and Rintaro (\"Galaxy Express 999\", \"Captain Harlock\"). However, Nakamura is best known for \"Serial Experiments: Lain\". (Writer Sadayuki Murai has many Anime Writing credits, including \"Perfect Blue\" and \"Cowboy Bebop\")\"Kino's Journey\" doesn't have the cohesiveness of \"Serial Experiments: Lain\", nor does it have Lain's series wide story. Each episode of Kino can stand on it's own, even when it alludes heavily to earlier stories. Worse, all the episodes seem to have no real order. Many of them are shown simply as a series of flashbacks, while others are obviously earlier in her life even though they are at the end of the series. This can be confusing. My biggest complaint though is the fact that this seems to be a series with a story that has a lot of chapters missing. I don't know if this was based on a Manga, but it has that feel to it. The feel that there's more story that has been told somewhere else and that we're expected to know something about it. I consider this minor, and possibly to be corrected if more episodes are ever produced.Some highlights I'd like to mention are the excellent animation and attention to detail. For instance Hermes, Kino's motorcycle and partner, is a very detailed and exact animation of a 1920's to 1940's Borough Superior J.A.P. engined SS100. It is correct right down to friction dampers, suspension, and saddle bags. Another example is Kino's pistol. It is a Colt Army, cap and ball black powder revolver of roughly Civil War vintage. Even when disassembled it is correctly drawn.The characters Kino meets and the places she goes are also nicely drawn in a fashion that is very reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki's various films. Almost every place seems to be stuck in a time period somewhere between 1920 and 1960, and in a world where WWII never happened. Kino's Journey reminds me of a mixture of a lot of things. It's \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\" combined with \"Then Came Bronson\" and \"Easy Rider\" and even \"Kung Fu\". It will not appeal to all Anime fans, but anybody that is attracted to Anime like \"Serial Experiments: Lain\" or \"Ghost in the Shell\" should appreciate this.",
        "Anim\u00e9 is known for showcasing characters with super-human powers, or mostly not even human at all. It is known for it's original and bizarre stories and story lines, which seem to fascinate every animation fan. It is a big hit among viewers who enjoy watching the endless possibilities of story making. It is, I believe the very nature of japanimation. But to be honest it is very rare to see an anim\u00e9 much like this one I'm going to review about, called \u2013\"Kino No Tabi\".Sometimes called \"Kino's Journey\" or \"Kino's Travels\" \u2013\"Kino No Tabi\" is probably the most artiest and most thought-proving anim\u00e9 I've seen (really!). Based from the sensational novel series by Keiichi Sigsawa that became popular in Japan back in 2000, \"Kino No Tabi\" is the unique story of a young traveler named Kino, and Kino's traveling companion, a talking motorcycle named Hermes. Together, they travel from country to country, meeting different people, and exploring different cultures. They learn and discover new things as they travel, and thus, making this show a delightful series, because you learn with its characters.It is likely that you'll be surprised with the series' unconventional stories, and it's unusual characters (that appear in every episode) it may seem slow sometimes since the characters do much talking than anything else, since this is after all the way that this show uplifts itself \u2013through the characters' interactions with one another, especially the conversations with Kino and Hermes. You will marvel at Kino's calmness and rational ways of dealing with matters that most of us don't give a damn about.Kino is an intelligent, and charming character despite having to act coldly at times. Another unusual thing about \"Kino No Tabi\" is Kino's gender. It wasn't made clear in the first to third episodes, since some characters in the stories refer to Kino as a boy and some called her \"miss\". What's even more confusing would be Kino's use of \"boku\" (a Japanese pronoun used by a male to refer to himself) when speaking. But this will be made clear during the 4th episode. I don't want to give spoilers, but it was a cool concept by the author to make Kino's gender a mystery.Featuring the voice of Ai Maeda as Kino (she played Shiori Kitano in \"Battle Royale 2: Requiem\"). Hers is perfect for the character of Kino, since it's quite hard to distinguish her voice (if male or female). As you know, most anim\u00e9 have women do the voice acting for some male characters (especially if the characters are young boys). So it won't be surprising if her character, Kino is a boy \u2013or maybe not.All I can say, \"Kino No Tabi\" will not be like any other anim\u00e9 you've seen. It's a brilliant series that uniquely unveils various human philosophies. It's one of those shows you'd be glad you took the time to watch.From the people behind the shows \u2013\"Serial Experiments Lain\", \"Haibane Renmei\", and \"Boogiepop Phantom\".. \"Kino No Tabi\" is another show yet to impress you with it's brilliance and it's unique expression of a radical sense of \"beauty\".",
        "Some of these stories felt uncanny to me and i still can't quite know exactly why\nBut it is a very good show and even though I'm on episode 4 i can tell this'll be good.",
        "This is one of those little gems you discover late one night binge- watching anime. No one has ever mentioned it to you, you have nothing else better to do, and the cover art doesn't remind you of another action-packed vampire love story. That being said, I went into Kino's Journey blind and I came out enlightened. It was like I was a child exploring the world for the first time again. Along with her talking motorcycle companion, \"Hermes\", Kino is a traveler who has a rule to never stay in one place for more than 3 days. The world is similar to Earth except that what are considered \"countries\" are really independent, walled cities that are seemingly very spaced apart. Each episode is self contained as Kino visits one or more country, and just as Kino and Hermes, we experience each place for the first time. The countries have their own unique histories, customs, and cultures. All are interesting; some are dangerous.There is something so powerful in the quiet storytelling of this series. Kino's Journey really explores the very edges of what it means to be human. We are all flawed, yet it is how we deal with our flaws that defines us. Similar to many other series I have watched, I just wish there was more. There are only two other anime that I have seen that have mastered the art of quiet storytelling: \"Mushishi\", and \"House of Five Leaves\".As of now (Jan 2014), the English Dubbed version is available on Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus. NOTE: Amazon Prime doesn't have any commercials.",
        "So what is Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World about? The story focuses on Kino, a young dark haired girl and her talking motorrad named Hermes, as they travel from country to country, experiencing the abstract and hyberbolic customs and traditions of each land, staying only three days in each country before moving on to a different one and repeating the process. So lets start with the setting. Kino's Journey has arguably the most impressive world building that I have ever seen in an anime. Every episode (with the exception of one 2 episode long country) we are treated to a new country with traditions completely different from the previous one. The lands that Kino and Hermes arrive in show off the different aspects of the human condition brought on by the circumstances of each country. It is jarring to comprehend this show's ability to create such distinct and fleshed out setting and to be able to do it as many times as they do during the course of the show. The soundtrack in this show is and interesting point to discuss since music is seldom used. The saying \"less is more\" is something I would use to describe the way music is used throughout the show, when music is used so little during the show, you really feel the magnitude of the moment when music is used. It really captures the crucial moments in the series. Kino no Tabi's soundtrack is seamless and the music chosen is chosen perfectly for each part.The story is not a character driven one because the events themselves are what put forward the anime's heavy messages. Because of this we get very little insight into Kino's motives, aside from episode 4 where we learn about her past, she still remains a fairly static and mysterious character. Hermes, Kino's talking motorrad, acts as Kino's voice of reason and for the most part serves as an extension to Kino's character and allows for dialogue throughout the story since Kino and Hermes are the only major characters we see. despite what may be thought of a talking motorbike as a major character, Hermes is not by any means a comic relief character and offers realism in situations where Kino is challenged. I think that character is this story's weakest point, but is by no means bad. Static characters are okay when the story does not rely on character development to present it's themes.The art style is really quite simple, you wont get anything spectacular from the visuals but you won't be disappointed either. The colours chosen are deliberately dull and plain. The art takes a back seat to the story and serves as a canvas to convey the more important messages.Overall, Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World is an elegant dissection of the characteristics that compose human existence represented by foreign lands and exaggerated cultures. If it sounds like a lot to comprehend that's because it is, this is a story that must be paid close attention to in order to comprehend it's depth. Every episode raises a heavy existential question that will leave you lying awake all night trying to figure out it's meaning, that's my favourite part about it and these are the reasons that I think Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World deserves it's 10/10.",
        "If your reading this, you've probably already read the summary so I'm just gonna go on with my thoughts. My friend, who knows my taste well, introduced me to this anime and it definitely was something I like. I've watched and completed many different ones, but this anime was probably the one that struck me most so far. It's unique comparing to all the others. It will give you a different kind of emotional experience through the eyes of a traveler, and many life lessons along the way. You get to know the complex character of Kino very well as you go on throughout the episodes. Which is another reason why it is different from other clich\u00e8 anime with simple characters that are very easy to figure out.",
        "Best show I have EVER seen. I mean, Kino is so composed, and Hermes is so interesting...It's not stupid, but it's not boring. Intriguing. Wonderful. Beautiful art. Amazingly well thought out characters, considering they only stay for one or two episodes. Definitely one of the greats. And, plus, Kino can take care of herself. Considering that she's a girl, at least. She has like ten knives, and plus her three guns, one of which is named Mori no Hito, Person of the forest. Too bad it's so short, I wish it would last longer. Hopefully the movie will explain the loose ends. Also, the fact that Motorrads talk is very fun. I also love the dialog, and the sayings that appear at random throughout the anime."

Great Days is my favorite Jojo opening. A truly beautiful Duwang.GOLDEN WIND: As always the main team is great. The torture dance is one of the finest pieces of animation ever created. Polnareff is turtle.The Rohan OVAs are also great.\nI can't wait for Stone Ocean.",
        "This show is really bad. As in almost unwatchable. The dialog is very childish while the imagery is fairly violent so its one of those shows that doesnt know what it wants to be. And no, this doesnt make it Bizarre, this is actually very common in movies, tv shows and anime. Its pretentious.Im trying to find a good way to compare this to well known anime... Remember DBZ? Well the dialog in that is a masterpiece by comparison and that was designed for young teens. Another good compare might be Fist of the North Star if it were filled with dialog rather than stoic scenes. But at least that one was self aware enough to zip it. This one... the author just doesnt know how to control themselves... it would be better without dialog because the dialog is really that bad.Back to the main gripe, this show has no identity. I have no idea who this one is for. It reminds me of playing make believe with friends back when I was 1st or 2nd grade where we would one up each other every other sentence. Basically a segway to comic book nerd talk but at the level of 2nd graders. Its really that bad and the only reason one might consider it to be \"Bizarre\" is because I cant imagine an adult who can stand characters like this. So in an ironic way, what is bizarre are people who actually like this especially if they are over 12 years old... Otherwise the stories themselves are rather mundane with very one dimensional characters. If anything the stories are boring, not bizarre.Anyway... skip this if you have working neurons or prepare to be trolled by the high reviews... I was definitely trolled. Congrats trolls ;-p.",
        "Memes aside, I watched a couple of episodes and it gets better and better. The animation and drawings are soo good. It's also full of dramatic emotions and the characters are so likeable. This anime is amazing even if not much dramatic like part 1. Edit: part 6 is out and is great, full of colors. Araki doesn't disappoint.",
        "I don't really understand how this is rated so high. Maybe it's literally just for the meme's that have been generated around this anime. However the anime itself is pretty bad in my opinion.The animation and its style is poor. There are often just still images or slow movement. Then there are certain Japanese written characters popping up on screen to apparently highlight movements or things that happen to the environment. Imagine that the ground is trembling due to some action but instead of seeing the actual impact of the action you see some weird signs popping up that you can't even read.I made it to episode 6 before I couldn't stand to watch it anymore. However from what I had seen the characters in the show are rather one dimensional. Jojo is just good and overly trusting. Dio is simply just bad for the sake of being bad. Then there is Speedstar who for whatever reason is just kinda in love with Jojo. And we have a basic mentor kind of character that \"teaches\" Jojo the use of Hamon even though he basically just picks it up instantly and becomes very good very quickly. There is nothing really to get me invested in these characters as they are boring.The dialogues are painful and basically just focused on exposition and yelling at each other things like \"You are bad!\", \"I'm going to stop you.\" and \"I will kill you.\". There is nothing interesting there.If you enjoy this show, then good for you. Maybe for some this is just in the category of it's so bad that it's great. For me though it's just bad.",
        "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is about the Joestar familys bizarre adventures. It is an adaption of the very popular manga by Hirohiko Araki.Plot: The plots are good. It might be a little repetitiveAnimation - It has a distinct art style where the characters have a very noticeable outline. There are also a lot of muscly people. It is also very colourful and the characters colour design changes randomly, sometimes and I really like it. It is also animated by David Productions. I like the fight scenes.Characters - The main characters are usually very muscly. It is, most of the time, clearly difined about who is good and bad.Originality - The only thing unique about it is the animation and some of the abilities, in Jojo. Apart from that it is not really original.Enjoyment - The 1st series (part 1 and 2) and part 4, is quite boring often, but it pays off at the end. Part 3 and 5 are quite enjoyable.Voice Acting - The Sub is a lot better than the Dub. The Sub has good voice actors that do their job well.Music - The music in Jojo is great and they often use a lot of Japanese and English songs.Ranking Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Parts:\n1. Golden Wind\n2. Stardust Crusaders\n3. Battle Tendency\n4. Phantom Blood\n5. Diamond is UnbreakableI would recommend Jojo's Bizarre Adventure to anyone interested in manly, action anime.",
        "9 episodes in, and the story has basically been:1) Hero unleashes awesome new ability\n2) Antagonist is immune to that ability\n3) It was a actually just a trick, so the hero could get around the antagonist's defended with a secret other awesome ability\n4) The antagonist is immune to that too\n5) Repeat steps 1-4 about 5 timesAnd then...\n6) The hero finally kills the antagonist\n7) But the antagonist didn't actually die.8) Repeat steps 1-7 indefinitely.To make matters worse, none of the characters are developed much, there's very little attention to the backdrop, and the whole story is wrapped up in just two main characters with a few 'throw away' side characters supporting them at different times. No complexity, no plot, just fight scene after fight scene in the style above, like a child making up rules to a game while playing it.Voice acting for the English version is pretty bad too.",

        "Tried watching diamond is Unbreakable, as well as the new series and found that I did not like them as much as the first three seasons. The first pre-season's are pure gold and amazing. They follow a storyline that connects all three of them which makes it great, and it's not overly complicated. All of a sudden when you get into diamond is unbreakable it becomes suddenly complicated and downright boring. I don't know what happened, but it just doesn't have the same vibe and doesn't work. When Dio isn't there, or his son is, it just doesn't really work.",
        "First two seasons are barely OK imo but at the end of DIO's arc ... Amazing. One of My favorite Animated series 4 sure but I was very sceptical for a long time but in the end it actually payed off !!! Great likeable characters and imaginative storytelling, very cool !",
        "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or JJBA for is an incredible anime based on the Shonen manga by the same name.JoJo's Bizarre adventure is about a bloodline of young men who have magical abilities. These range from Spirit Guardians called Stands or Magical breath called Hamon. All in a goal to defeat evil vampiric forces.The saga is in 3 partsPHANTOM BLOOD- This one is a bit slow and boring but it gets better. Dio intrudes on society. He is very evil and everyone else likes him. He even kills dogs! (By the way there are a lot of doggy deaths in this entire series) He is so bad he's good. Jonathan hates Dio. Dio wants a magic mask. Jonathan goes off on a magical adventure to learn how to use Hamon to focus his Chi with Speedwagon. He has to defeat vampires.Oh and by the way. Many of the characters are named after famous rock bands of the time. It's quite hilarious.BATTLE TENDANCY- Battle Tendency continues with Jonathan Joestar's so Joseph. He is a witty young man who can tell how predictable people are not by magic by pure observation. JoJo learns that his life is being invaded by vampires. Now he must stop the vampires with an Italian friend and stop the pillar men with the help of the Nazis?! It's ok guys the Nazi's are here! Because the only thing worse than them is literal vampires! Also Speedwagon helps Joseph on his journey. There is lots of body horror in this tale. But overall I think BT is one of the best Jojo tales. Tons of plot twists to.STARDUST CRUSADERS- Stardust Crusaders is loved by most JoJo fans. But I think it's a bit much. It's far more structured like a fighting game than an actual story and yet it's still iconic and probably the most fast paced.Jotero Kujo. A 17 year old MAN's mother has been inflicted by a fever but not only a fever a deadly curse by Lord Dio! Now visited by his grandpa he must go on an Journey to see lord Dio. Only one problem THEIR PLAIN HAS BEEN SHOT DOWN! What seemed like an only 36 hour flight to Egypt has been stretched to 45 days! The clock is ticking! Jotero must slowly tread across the world to defeat Dio but they must face up against other STAND USERS! And you may never know what the Stand users are like? They could be an old lady, a man, twin brothers, a child, a car, an Orangutang , a sword or even an BABY! Jotero will make friends on his unlikely adventure with unlikely friends. A mage named Avdol and a Frenchman named John Pierre Polnereff. Kakyoin, another stand users/student. Stardust Crusaders has to be the most scary out of all of them because Dio is always shrouded in Darkness in every photograph. Each stand user is based on a famous horror film from around the 80's and tarot cards. Good thing Jotero is cool headed. How they went from Hamon to Stands I do not know.DIAMOND IS UNBREAKABLE- Diamond is Unbreakable is about the exploits of 2 Morio Cho student boys who are stand users. But a series of murders take place from the devilish Kira Yoshikage. He is so evil. All he wanted was a normal life at the cost of others. He pretends to be the dad of a 10 year old boy and a loving strong husband. We have Josuke, he has the power to injure but also heal. He goes on an investigation with his friend to stop the murders. Along the way you meet Jotero and Grandpa Joseph Joestar and go on the case. Jotero says he's a marine biologist but he doesn't even do anything with Dolphins. Jotero is the brains and Joseph uses his Haman to prevent bad things.I for one think this is the best story so far in the JoJo anime canon. It's not a fighting game, not a slow plodding drama, but something like part 2 but more hardboiled. But make no mistake. Don't skip anything.GOLDEN WIND-So far I like Golden Wind. I must admit, it's hard to get into at first but it gets better. Golden Wind is about Dios son Giorno who has Dio's powers but isn't vampiric? What? He's an italian boy who is a stand user. He gets involved with some sort of mafioso\nOne thing I hated about Golden Wind is that the fashion is very runway and very bad. Do Italians dress like this? With hair curlers and pink jumpsuits with unzipped heart chests? Son where I come from you'd get dress coded or jumped. But that doesn't matter because you are stand user!But despite every series having it's differences and ups and downs JoJo's Bizarre adventure has all the same sh'mood.ANIMATION\nJoJo has some of the most detail in it's animation of any anime that currently exists and it shows. There is cross hatching in everything. As a result, there isn't much animation. That isn't to say there isn't fluidity but all the characters happen to pose like statues or even exist looking like statues with tons of detail also JoJo has tons and tons of camera pans and obnoxious comic book effects. It's style is similar to that of the manga book. There is tons of blood to.The Backdrops give me a sense of nostalgia. I feel like I have been in these strange lonely clean places before. Seen anime on 4kids with these. They are all painted and feel like Yu-Gi-Oh or Sonic X. (The kind of detail Americans refuse to go through in their animation usually) This could be the reason why I like Jojo so much. The colors are cool at times to. But what is annoying at times is the bad CGI, oh well.But overall JJBA is quite nice to look at with it's unique art style.HUMOR\nTo sum up the humor in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure it has to be like this. Ehem \"*farts* UHOH! STINKY! POOOP! HAHAHA! POOP FUNNY! FUNNY POOP! HAHAHA UHOH! STINK! POOPIES POOOPO POoPOOPOPOPOPOOPOOPOOPOOPOOPOOPOOPOOPOOP! POopies! Good poopy! Heheehee! Poop make me happy! Poopy underpants no diaper that's funny! We want poopies WE WANT POOPIES!\" Yes there is a lot of poop jokes in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Every where Polnareff has to go he has to go to the restroom. Or lots of sex jokes and shock humor. Lot's of puns and other weirdness galore. The humor does get better as you go through the seasons.DRAMA\nFor every laugh worthy moment there is a sad moment. Someone important dies. And you really feel it. If one of the characters dies their souls drift into the air and you see their persona and it's sad. It's like when Simba sees Mufasa in the clouds or something similar but you feel the essence of their death in the atmosphere. The show is full of sad moments.To make matters worse. There are fates worse than death like one of the 3 Pillarmen gets shot into space and gets frozen for all eternity. Only to dwell on his thoughts. Never to eat blood again.AUDIO\nNow this is something I want to Judge and Jojo has to be the loudest anime I have ever watched. It goes from 0 to 50 in it's audio editing. One second two guys will just be looking at each other menacingly and the suddenly WHAM! BAM! But in Japanese. They punch each other!Also the dub is kinda bad. It's cheesy and doesn't sync up with the sub. I'd prefer to watch the sub but I'm like nah.Also Joseph Joestar sounds like Nigel Uno from Codename Kids next door.Be prepared for exposition because this anime has tons of it! Each of the characters will be a skin of their teeth even being vored and suddenly they will say in Speed Racer style \"AndsoonIwillusemyultimatesuperpowerattackfrommystandtoblastyoufrom themitocondriaofmyDNA.youcannotpossiblydefeatme! MAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH!\" GASP\"What?!Howdidheknowmysuperduperpowerultramagicattackthatcandefeathim?!\" I'm not even joking. They go through this. It over explains things. But I think it does good so far.JoJo does have some good music to.OVERALL\nJoJo's Bizarre adventure starts slow as a franchise. But it get's better and better as it goes. JoJo is great especially if you love Yu Gi Oh. And also stop making annoying references to Jojo because nobody brought up Jojo until you did!",
        "Don't know why this anime was split into parts 1 and 2. I just watched episodes 1-26, so I'm going to review it as one show.It starts with a rich family (the Joestars) adopting a poor boy named Dio. Dio is the same age as the Joestar's son, Jonathan, and they become fierce rivals at everything trying to get the attention of Jonathan's father. Initially, Dio is better at everything, but as they grow up, Jonathan catches up to Dio, making him bitter and twisted. One day, he finds a stone mask, that when attached to his face, transforms him into an evil vampire...The shows stretches over 3 generations of Joestars and each son is nicknamed Jojo. They spend their lives fighting vampires and other, stronger immortals.What I really liked about this show was the humour. The characters were all great and the animation and action scenes were awesome, but the humour turned what could have been a dark, horror type story into something really fun. Normally, I'd prefer them to have left out the humour and gone down the dark path, but in this case, it really works well. Definitely worth a watch!",

        "I first heard of Jojo's bizzare adventures from anime critics who taunted anime lovers that Jojo is the pinnacle of a terrible shounen anime. According to them, jojo is the reason many bad shounen anime exists because they were mostly inspired by this anime. Some years later, I decided to give it a try myself and I went into the show with no expectations. The show was so good I used 2 weeks to complete all 4 seasons.Jojo is one of the most unique, intriguing and brilliant anime to have ever existed. The story is unpredictable and the characters, be it protagonists or antagonists, are so well written. I love how the story takes a gradual step right from the beginning in the 19th century until the 21st century. I also love the way the characters fight battles using their brains and experience as opposed to the \"power of friendship\" or some silly power up. I can't put to words how perfect this anime is. All I can say is that the Jojo is the emperor of all shounen anime.",
        "The characters are dislikeable. The writing is poor. Incredibly boring. The music is OK but I have plenty of good music without this Anime in my life. It is very typical Japanese stuff. Most of all it just wasn't fun to watch.",
        "4 main reasons I love Jojo:1. Every single main protagonist is likable and easy to get attached to\n2. The creativity and unpredictability to the story adds to the fun in a way that western media can't reciprocate\n3. Easily rewatchable, with the exception of the first part with Jonathon\n4. The show is easily 100 times better while hitting a bong, blunt or jointHowever, the quality between seasons is really varied, so I'm just going to rate the seasons individually for myself. Since I've only watched the entire thing once, this is mostly a first impression, and I'm likely to change the rating on rewatches later on.1. Diamond is Unbreakable - 8.5 - By far my favorite installment of the series, and the most casual and relaxing season of Jojo's. Everything in this part is done really well - the plot, humor, the villain, the side characters, and the protagonist, when combined, make for the most entertaining part of this series.2. Golden Wind - 7.8 - The latest part, Golden Wind, obviously has the best animation out of all of them. It also has the best music, fighting gold. The beginning and middle of the arc is all non stop entertainment and action, which I immensely enjoyed. I also loved that this part stretched and explored the concept of a stand while applying it to crime organizations. If it kept up that level of quality throughout the entire season, this part would've been my favorite. However the ending was weak in my opinion; whereas other Jojo finales were resolved with creativity and storytelling, this one felt a little anticlimactic. It certainly didn't hit as hard when characters got injured because they switched bodies.3. Stardust Crusaders - Between a 7 and an 8 - I really need to rewatch this one to determine how much I enjoyed this. On one hand, this part had the best villain in the series with Dio. However, Dio easily had the worst supporting villain cast in JoJo. This season is the opposite of Golden Wind; it starts off slow and also has a long, tedious middle part. But the finale and ending is definitely the best of the series. I'll need to see this again to decide whether the ending makes up for the weak middle.4. Battle Tendency - 7 - If Golden Wind didn't exist, this part would definitely take the cake for best music. In my opinion they messed up by killing off Caesar. Jojo and Caesar's brotherhood was the best part of this season.5. Phantom Blood - Between a 5 and a 6 - I really didn't enjoy this first part; I just found it tolerable. It's necessary to watch in order to understand what comes later in the series, and the fact that it is short helps a lot. Now that I've finished watching Golden Wind, it really is funny and crazy to think about how this all started; however I will never rewatch this part.",
        "I watched season 1 when it came out years ago, and seeing that Netflix now got it on their platform with a 2nd season I wanted to give it a re-watch, and try out S2.Season 1 was a bit confusing being 2 stories in one. Part one we have the rivalry between Joseph Joestar (JoJo) and his adopted brother Dio. This will involve a old mask that's been in the Joestar family for ages, that gives Dio unnatual powers, forcering JoJo to learn the power of Hamon to fight Dio.This part feels a little bit too quick, but the show is great at giving character delevopment and when part 1 ends you will have a hollow feeling but any other ending than that would not work.Then part 2 og S1 begins and the story now follows the grandson of JoJo, also called JoJo. Unlike his grandfather JoJo is arrogant and careless, which is a bit hard to get use to, but it didn't take long for me to enjoy him as a character. He is also a natural Hamon user which helps him since they people behind the mask that have Dio his powers, have surfaced and he's gonna need all the power he has to battles these enermies. The part also have some great parallels to the first part that becomes some good closers and powerfull moments. All this done is 26 episodes.The art style and weird story makes season 1 worth every little bit.Then we have season two which now is 48 episodes... and... boy can you feel it have 48 episodes... the concept of Hamon have more less been abandoned and replaced with Stands. Stands are battle spirits that apperently just started to emerge when and old foe apears, they are names after Tarot cards and have different powers, and the only way go kill a Stand is with another Stand.This change is not the biggest problem, a lot of the episodes are actully pretty cool and fun, but there are also A LOT of episode that just feels like filler and slows down the show. The best part of S1 was that everything felt like it had weight and there was a sense of urgency. All of that is lost in S2. When people got hurt in S1 you feared for their lives because the show is not shy about killing main people off. That went away in S2 and it seems like consourship came along with it, and it's the the kind where they fill over half the screen with black, making it super clear that it's been censored...Enough rant about S2 it feels too long but still enjoyable.Watch season 1 for a good story and season 2 if you just want more and don't really care about the story anymore",
        "Part 1 and 2:Jojo's bizarre adventure is a show that probably every anime fan has heard of. It is, in my opinion, one of the most popular shows of all time. Cause even if you haven't watched it, you know the memes. Even if you haven't heard of the show completely, the \"to be continued\" meme will crawl into your life anyway.\nSo it wasn't surprising that I was going to watch the show eventually. And to be honest, I was a little disappointed. Here's why:\nMy biggest problem with the show is the pacing. Many episodes can feel so long, because of the fight scenes. The characters always have to stop and explain what to do or stop to warn the enemy that they will do something. I have two problems with this. First, why would they do this? Why do they expect the enemy to also stop what they're doing, to listen to what the protagonist has \"planned all along\". It also ruins the pacing, as I said before. The episode would probably be half as long if they didn't show us a bunch of exposition at us. You can give information without text, you know that right. \"Show, don't tell\" is important, but wasn't considered here.And sadly, that was the thing that \"ruined\" the show (I still liked it). It was harder to enjoy the show when the episodes were so boring. Cause there were many things about the show that was very unique. The fight scenes didn't consist of only punches and kicks. There was an actual strategy, which is very unique in these kinds of shows. Without the exposition, the fight scenes would have been great!\nI was also very immersed in the story and wanted to know what was going to happen. Especially in the multi-episode fights, where I needed to know who was going to win. If it I wasn't immersed enough, I wouldn't have felt the same.\nAnd lastly, I really liked the style that the show went with. The weird colors and patterns were so unique and cool to look at. I wouldn't say that the visuals were fantastic, but were unique and interesting to look at.\nSo I'm sorry all of you Jojo fans. I still liked it, just not enough I guess...Strong 7/10"

    "Nichijou: My Ordinary Life": [
        "When one thinks about school based comedy anime titles like 'Azumanga Daioh', 'Lucky Star' and 'School Rumble' spring to mind... to that list should be added Nichijou, AKA My Ordinary Life. This isn't really like any of those series though; it is far more surreal for a start, characters include Nano; a robot girl who was built by The Professor who is herself only eight years old! There is also a talking cat, a boy who rides to school on a goat and a girl who pulls out huge guns when annoyed! What makes the series such fun is that these things are all played straight; apart from her science teacher nobody seems perturbed by the fact that Nano has a giant key in her back.The episodes are broken up into several parts which are often unrelated; in the first half of the series Nano and the Professor's story is totally separate from that of comparatively normal school girls Yuko, Mio and Mai who are the other protagonists. The animation is not particularly detailed and but that suits the series and gives it a distinctive look that I really liked. The main attraction of the series though is the cast of likable characters who somehow manage to be believable even in the most bizarre situations. The fact that it is effectively a stream of sketches means that if one bit isn't amusing you something different will be along very soon. As you can tell I really enjoyed this series and hope that it gets a UK DVD release.These comments are based on watching the series on line on Crunchyroll in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "Ive seen this anime being mentioned on YouTube as one of the funniest animes out there, I needed a laugh soI gave this anime a go. I personally didn't find the jokes funny at all in this, actually they were quite dull, unclever and boring. The scene where your ones octopus sausage fell from her chopsticks and it kept on slipping, made me think it was just a way to grind my gears. I mean c'mon, its pure unrealistic that a sausage that slipped would still be floating from one thing to another in order to not fall in the ground. The reality is that it either falls on the ground or falls back into her lunchbox.I probably am the only one here that didn't get this anime but honestly, I found this pure unoriginal and just not a cup of tea to have a taste in watching more eps. I'd rather add this to my miss list to be honest ..",
        "This anime makes The Boxtrolls' writing look good. Actually, this is the worst anime that came out in a long time. It's unbelievable how bad this anime can get. At first, you got the two group of kids and their ordinary yet unusual lives but then they have the kids meet and they expect to make the audience go \"Awwww....\" but it turns out to be more cutesy than cute. But I was just sitting there, yelling at the screen and cannot get past this anime.I guess it was because it would make the anime confusing if they don't support each other but at the end, it's like the writers and directors aren't even trying anymore. The anime bears some similarities to Azumanga Daioh but that has better writing.This shows that KyoAni cannot make good anime. Maybe one day they'll make something decent to watch.D+",
        "This show is absolutely hilarious. I love everything about it. It's very cute and funny. The characters have the most over the top reactions and the animation is really good. The premise of the show is that they are all buddies in highschool. There is Youkko she is upbeat but pretty lazy and never does her homework She secretly has a crush on the Farmer and blasts him with her Imaginary guns when she doesn't want to reveal her crush on him. There is Mio she is the over achiever and she is the smart one and has a short temper and she is an manga artist who secretly draws yoai. There is Mai she is always deadpan and doesn't talk much when she does it's funny. There is Hassakei she is 8 years old and just happens to be a scientist ala Dexter's Laboratory. She likes to eat all day, She is happy all the time, is laid back and irresponsible. There is Nano. The robot Girl she built. She is basically her big sister she is the responsibile one and she takes care of her. She is very shy and she is ashamed of being a robot because she just wants to be like a normal little girl. She is often the straight man. She doesn't like the key in her back she is like a wind up doll. They have a cranky stuck up cat Sakomoto. He has a scraf Hasseke made that allows him to talk. There are several other characters too those are the main ones. Expect alot of mayhem over the top reactions, really dumb gags. They go about Normal things in the strangest way.",
        "WOWI rarely write reviews but when I have to, I do. This show is amazing since the beginning. Lately I've been watching a lot of anime and I've found amazing stuff, last week I stumbled upon Kobayashi-san chi no Maid Dragon and I couldn't stop watching it, so I asked around my friends who know more about anime and one told me about this piece of gold show. He showed me a couple of youtube clips and I was amazed. So I wen't straight to it and I was hooked so badly, I watched 13 episodes in a row. I don't even know how to start talking about what I watched, at the beginning it gave me the impression that it was going to be a \"Funky Forest\" experience, with all the clips unrelated and all the craziness going on, but the story starts to shape from the pieces and it's done with mastery. The writing and timing of the story it's life-like and perfect so you can just dig into the show slowly until you totally love it. The animation is amazing too, I love how they have all the references to everything that's been drawn, I laughed at a Tintin reference that is so funny and subtle at the same time that I had to pause that episode. There are some cuts that are mere poetry (and the good kind too), all the dreamy parts are amazing, and the action scenes are so full of movement it's incredible, the constant contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary are very well done. I just enjoyed how every character is developed, how real the girls feel like, how the animal's personalities are portrayed, and the interactions between character are very cautiously set together, that the show feels so real no matter how crazy the situations in it are developing. It's divided in two parts and the second one becomes a little more serious than the first one, it's when everything starts making sense (in a way) and it takes a little more intelligence (I think) to understand what's going on and put the pieces together, and if the first part was amazing, the second one is just filled with miracles and it's built perfectly that when the last episode comes, it's joy coming out of the viewer's mind. It's filled with running gags, great music and catchy songs, and so full of happiness that looks simple, but it's made with pure genius, I love how this was made. It is a must watch, I didn't know nothing about Kyoto Animation but with this show in their history, I'm going to watch everything they've ever done. And I need the manga this show is based on, immediately11 out of 5 stars, this is amazing and I can't believe I'm alive and watching this, I am so grateful right now with everyone involved in this, my heart pounds like a stampede... calm down my cowboy, Bill Watts!",
        "I don't watch Anime a lot, and I'm not particularly into Anime, but this show blew my mind in so many ways. It is, in my opinion, perfection.The animation, the characters, the bizarre editing style and humor (which is genius, because it melds slice of life with super expressive over-exaggerated action anime) the music (holy smokes, the music is fantastic) and the story / skits; everything worked great.I love the 3 main characters, their chemistry is excellent, and they are very funny when they are together. The side characters, Nano, the Professor, and Mr. Sakamoto is one of the most fascinating character dynamics I've ever seen, I love every second of their story-line, it is a super unique trio of characters.This is a super under-rated show. Why? Because not many people know about it, and when it was released, it didn't find much success. Some of the clips get millions of views, and I happen to learn about it from a YouTube video about it, but it needs more love, and more watch time. It is very sad to know that a second season won't come to light because of how poorly it did financially. I hope the animators and the people who worked on this show know that there is a loving fan-base that adores and supports their show, and I hope they do great things with their talents. Please watch this show!",
        "Slightly less than gintama level comedy. And i want season 2 of this.",
        "Slightly overrated because there is no interesting story to follow.",
        "This show is excellent. Nichijou represents the pinnacle of Kyotoani's talents.It is understandable why Nichijou has such high ratings on IMDb and other sites.It may not have sold well but it is undoubtedly one of the greatest anime series of all time. If you are a fan of either comedy or anime there is no reason for you to not pick this one up. Nichijou is a delightful, relateable and hilarious show with a high production value and terrific music. Give it a watch or you'll regret it.",
        "Nichijou is based on one of my favourite ongoing manga, Nichijou - which means, \"simple\". And just that, it is. It's the average life of Mio, an aspiring manga artist, and \"Yukko\" Aioi, the local village idiot, as they go through their simple, dull lives.Cue to odd, odd situations, that didn't make sense in any of the writer's minds.The animation's great, the source material is similarly well-drawn, the music, what little there is, is annoyingly catchy, and it's -just- normal seeming enough to pass as kind of normal. The only problem? There's so much poorly implemented English that subtitles - if you can't speak Japanese - are completely optional. And yet Keiichi is able to sneak in puns in Indonesion all the time. Then again, it's Kyoto Animation. It's also episodic enough to be able to jump in anytime, though.",
        "This anime is literally \"comedy gold\" and \"slice of live gold\" if that makes any senseThe way that every single episode not only brings something new as in \"story/jokes/humor/ect\", it also never fails to be funny and out of the top,It's not to point where you'd be real confused and braindead because of how \"over\" the anime is \"if that makes sense\"It's at that level where it's \"over\" and \"out of the top\" yet you can still comprehend everything and laugh along, it's brilliant!!I can go on and on about how good the show is in general, but I'll keep it simple,It's funny it's out of the top it's gold and lots more,Sadly it didn't get a second season but with words that the manga is gonna come back I have high hopes for a second season, hopefully they'll keep the second season the same as the original, as in they'll keep the same humor and stuff,But yeah if you asked me if I recommend you this anime I 100% recommend it.",
        "This was the one of first anime I ever seen. I am gonna sound like a fanboy but this show has everything.When I watched this I couldn't stop watching it, I watched all 26 episodes in 3 days. I'm watching it again right now just because I think the show is a lot of fun to watch.This show has great ratings for a reason, watch it and you will know why, the main characters have a very strong personality to them, the storyline is amazing, overall great story.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching comedy, more specific, slapstick comedy but I think anyone who gives this anime a try will love it.",
        "I throughly enjoyed watching Nichijou so much that i just finished it for the second time. After the first watch i read all the available Manga. The characters are very vibrant and memorable. There are a lot of moments when i just found myself smiling. The music for opening and closing are well picked, it will cheer you up if your down. You will see a lot of hilarious moments, awesome series wish it got more noticed. If you like shows like Gintama, Arakawa under the bridge, or Senyu you will enjoy this. Im sure i will watch again in the future. At times the jokes can be corny or hard to understand but i believe that was to add to the cuteness. The art is very nicely done, i wish there were more episodes to watch.",
        "Nichijou is, without a single doubt, one of the best slice of life made in the long history of slice of life.Its action-packed over-exaggerations of everyday life will undoubtedly keep all audiences in the edge of their seats, not knowing what sort of crazy antic will the show pull off right in front of them, be it a rigged carnival game, a deer attack or even an atomic bomb.The story itself is seemingly simple; it follows the daily life of fellow classmates Yukko, Mio and Mai, paralleled by the (not so) peaceful Shinonome household. While the main characters are undoubtedly robust, the show also brings a variety of supporting characters, all equally unique and lovable to an extensive degree.Many of the gags are easily understandable and fun to laugh at, though there are some jokes that rely heavily on the knowledge of Japanese culture (most notably the 'Helvetica Standard' segments). Though its intense energy in its presentation would surely give you a good chuckle regardless, even if the references don't exactly make sense immediately.The animation and voice acting further increases the level of intensity that Nichijou has to offer, with each frame giving the biggest impact, along with every voice lines being delivered with utmost passion from each voice actors.Overall, if you are a fan of slice of life, comedy, anime or even just a random passerby, Nichijou is an absolute recommendation, which will guarantee you, in the best scenario, an abundance of laughter and heartfelt joy, while in the worst case scenario, a few chuckle."

    "Ef: A Tale of Melodies.": [
        "This, the second 'EF' series is not a sequel to the first even if some characters appear in both. This is set in two different time periods. In the past we see Yuko Amamiya and her relationship with Yu Himura; a boy who she meets ten years after they knew each other in an orphanage; he learns that there are problems in her life and determines to help her. In the present Mizuki Hayama meets Shuichi Kuze; a violinist who is suffering from an illness that could kill him at any time... because of this he isn't keen to develop a friendship with her.'A Tale of Memories' was fairly downbeat at times but this series is even darker in tone as it delves into subjects of terminal illness and sexual abuse; thankfully the latter is spoken of rather than explicitly shown. The stories are nicely intertwined and told at a good pace. There are some genuinely shocking moments. The characters are interesting and distinctively designed. The animation is stunning in similar way to that of the first season. This is accompanied by a great soundtrack. Overall I'd definitely recommend this series; although not essential I'd recommend watching 'A Tale of Memories' first.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I have seen more than 100 anime series, this is among the very best of them, it is absolutely amazing how so strong emotions are expressed in such a suddle manner, I believe having this score currently is extremely unfair to this anime, thus I had to write my first comment ever on IMDb for a show. Scripts are very well prepared, the graphics are amazing, music is one of the bests ever - this totally puts you into the mood for the emotional roller coaster effects of this anime. Note: It is not for children, should be rated at least pg-15. (no violence or sexual images-language but the topics examined are very delicate (child abuse) and would be tough to handle for younger kids). If you want to understand what I mean better start from episode 6, and get ready for a real shock+treat.This is one of the perfect examples of Japanese anime art. In case you are newly interested in anime I would also recommend \"code geass\", \"vampire knight\", \"death note\", \"gankutsuou\", \"full metal panic\" (especially season 3), \"hikaru no go\", \"Nodame Cantabille\", \"ano hana\" and \"skip beat\".",
        "Just 10 doesn't make justice :)) The music is very, very, very good as the anime itself.It also continue the story from the series \"ef - a tale of memories\", about Yu Himura and Yuko Amamiya\u2019s relationship and Mizuki Hayama and Kuze Shuichi's relationship and also about the others. Kuze-san finally decides to make an surgically operation which is very risky, but with the high hopes gained from the others he succeeds :) About the Yu and Yuko, -well- you better see yourselves. I liked very much the episode where Mizuki responds to the many questions of Kuze-san and how she sing. Execuse my very bad English:)), but it's unfair for this excellent anime to not have comments. A comment with many mistakes it's better than none:))"

    "Last Exile": [
        "I bought this knowing little about it, I just liked the look of the artwork and the price. When I started to watch the first disc I knew that I'd made a good purchase. One is immediately thrown into the action as we see the Silvana, a giant aerial battleship engaging a fleet of enemy ships. The next scene introduces the two main characters; young pilot Claus and his Navigator Lavie who are working on their aircraft. The planes in the world of Last Exile aren't like ours, they lack wings but gain lift from a chemical called claudia. Thankfully the series doesn't dwell on the technology the viewer just has to accept that this is how things are in this world.Initially Claus and Lavie fly as couriers, this all changes when they see another vanship crash and agree to complete the dying pilot's mission. This is to deliver a young girl called Alvis to the Silvana. While on board the ship is engaged in battle and they end up staying on board. From then on they get into adventures with the Silvana and her crew as they confront various opponents and find out what makes Alvis so special and why the mysterious Guild is so keen to get their hands on her.There are three main groups in this series; the nations of Anatoray (where our heroes come from) and Disith seem to be in perpetual battle using ships which use technology provided by the Guild. The ships themselves look more like early battleships than aircraft as they lumber through the sky engaging each other with cannons and soldiers armed with muskets.While the series looks great its real strength lies in its large cast of interesting characters, not all of whom are quite what they seem at first and some of whom won't survive till the end. Everybody will have they own favourite characters, after Claus and Lavie my favourite was Lord Dio, a young Guild pilot who befriends our two heroes after being impressed by Claus's flying.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I will skip the talk about how good the animation is. I am not an expert in animation, nor do I let it get in the way if the story is good. Enough said, it is very good. What pushed my buttons is the way the series constructs a world, adds interesting lead characters and then ends the story. Yes, this is not one of those animes that drag the story, no matter how nice, and then end the series with no closure because the ran out of steam before finishing the plot. This is a good all fashioned circular story with build-up and release.Then there is the world, reminiscent of Frank Herbert's Pandora mixed with a little Dune, both in storyline and socio-ecological meaning. I would say that there are no great surprises in this anime. This is a bad thing, but also a good one. If you build things up too much they quickly become unmanageable. There is hope for a sequel, I guess, but no pressure for it. All the goals set in the beginning are met in the end, either in success or disaster.It is a nice anime series. It is worth watching, but I've seen better. I guess what really is missing is a way to truly connect with the characters. Even in the most tensioned moments, the levels of emotion don't get too high. I would say the starting theme song (complete with worthless karaoke style translation) is also a bad thing. The rest, though, is just visual and comfortable beauty.",
        "\"Last Exile\" it is a pretty good anime show. It combines great action sequences with likable characters and a incredible animation, not to mention the pretty good music of it.The plot of \"Last Exile\", reminds me somewhat \"Star Wars\" and \"Final Fantasy\". Of course, that doesn't mind it is a rip-off, because it manages to create its own mythology and epic.The combination of CGI and traditional animation had a pretty stylish and well made result, and it is one of the most impressive aspect of it.However, it doesn't only delivers great visuals, but also a great, epic storyline as well, with very interesting characters and unpredictable plot twists.\"Last Exile\" is a great show, and I think that even those who aren't anime fans might like this. I highly recommend it to anyone.",
        "Wo messengers by the name of Claus a fan ship pilot and Lavie a navigator are tasked with a 7 star mission by Ralph Wednesday. To safely deliver a young girl called Alvis to the Silvana, where she would be in care with an organisation called the guild lead by a Harlock like pilot called Alex Row. Which causes them to get dragged into a massive conflict.I thought the plot of the anime was an amazing ride especially in the final battle with dalphinea. I also enjoyed some of the characters back stories especially with how Claus and Lavie became close and the major plot twist behind Sophia.The characters are very well written. I really like the relationship with Lavie and Claus, even though there are times were I do think Lavie just overacted like the time when Claus goes on a mission with Tatiana and all he did was lend her his jacket. However, they are both good protagonists overall and have much better chemistry then Fam Fan and Giselle which I will probably get to in another review. Alex Row like mentioned he is like a Harlock especially with his design but over a very likeable character probably my favourite one of the series. Alvis is adorable and must protect... many of the other crew members such as Sophia being a big sister, Mulan and Alister just being there, while Tatiana despise my issues just being a good leader are always good to see in the series. Luciola and Dio (no not JoJo dio) we're excellent rivals to Claus and Dio always calling Claus Emo man is hilarious. Many of the other characters were good too.It's art style and animation definitely flows with the series. The ost's are fun to listen to.The dub cast including Johnny Yong Bosch, Kari Wahlgren (even if occasionally her voice could get on my nerves as Lavie), Michelle Ruff (though Tatiana and Alvis probably would have worked better with two different voice actors but still she does a good job making them sound distinctive from each other), Crispin Freeman, Julie Ann Taylor, Steve Blum, Joshua Seth, Mona Marshall, Kirk Thornton, Tony Oliver, Dave Wittenberg, The late Philece Sampler, Karen Strassman, Kate Higgins, the late Bob Papenbrook, Dave Mallow, Michael McConnohie, Mela Lee and many other voice actors all did well.If you are into stuff like hovercraft etc. You might enjoy this series.",
        "For some time now, this series which has led to a second season has been nothing more than grand. A girl named Fam, who loves to race, as well as scavenge for battle ships using what is known as Vanships. During an early part of the world's history, a weapon was used to stop a war on earth which then made it a one sided victory. A small land called Turan is on the brink of war between fascists and Turan itself. But in between is Fam, who along side her is a long standing best friend who is her navigator during race time, or pirate time. Yet both work in such Synchro,that it seems nothing can touch them both. In the second season, an episode which leads the viewer to war is episode 12. Where Fam is still seven years old with her best friend. The race is supposed to unite all on the world leading to peace, but in the dark corners of revenge, assassins carry out their plot and wipe out Queen Augusta, leader of all who in the back of her mind is uneasy by this new peace treaty. With her death, a new page of history is written and a full scale war is in the mold for first strike. This series, is a fresh look on family, friends, foes, and whoever else might be in the way of dreams. It captivates, keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat, brilliant music, and breathtaking flight scenes. It's a story of hope, despair, sadness, laughing, crying, and an idea to break free from the horrors of war. Fam is the light to all, and those who know her, only her abilities can bring back the hope people have lost. Especially when a deadly weapon is used once again on Turan. Wiping it clean off of the map. A must see series, highly recommended to this show and the second season, The Last Exile - Fam - The Silver Wing.",
        "Tech TV performed an incredible service by running a marathon of this incredible series.  I'm taping and watching the first tape as I type.Words cannot express what an incredible find this show is!  I haven't felt this entranced by Anime since the first time I saw Miyazaki's work. \nI've never seen anything like the airship designs herein.  Rather than airplanes and dirigibles, everything seems to be magnetic repulsion and steam engines.  The aerial warships are a wonderful blend of aircraft carrier and battleship.But all the great design wouldn't mean a thing if there was not an engaging tale.  Even briefly seen characters demand our attention, like the musketeer and ship's captain in the first episode.Well, back to watching more of the show.  I've definitely got to get this on DVD!",
        "\"Steampunk\", a mix of 1800's and sci-fi, is an interesting genre. It show's people wearing sci-fi equipment that look's like it came from the 1800's. There has'nt been a lot of Steampunk film's but there were two anime's that had something to do with the Steampunk genre:\"Steamboy\": An anime film made by Katsuhiro Otomo. The director of one of my favorite movie's, \"Akira\".\"Last Exile\": The anime show that I will be reviewing.The story is about two kids named, Lavi and Claus, one day they find a guy that tell's them to take a little girl named, Al, to take her to a battleship being controlled by the captain of the ship, Alex Row. They soon find themselves in a battle between Alex and The Guild and learn about a ship known as, Exile.This is one of my favorite anime show's. The story is interesting, the character's were likable, and the animation was incredible. It's just like the animation in, \"Titan A.E.\" and \"Treasure Planet\".The only problem I have with this show is that sometime's it can be very boring at time's.But overall, \"Last Exile\", is an anime show worth watching if you're into the Steampunk genre or someone looking for a good anime show to watch.",
        "This is a frustrating series because it had so much promise. The artwork and animation are superbly detailed. I couldn't believe I was watching an anime produced 8-9 years ago. The premise and story are pretty interesting as well, though somewhat disjointed. It felt like a love letter to the art and culture of air flight, but then that line clashes a bit with the whole sci-fi aspect of the series. The ending also feels abrupt and rushed. It felt like the story took an abrupt turn, the way that James Cameron's \"The Abyss\" did. But the ending wasn't built up the same way, leading to the rushed feeling at the end.On the bright side, not only does the artwork shine, but there are a few bright dramatic moments where the director builds the scene to an impressive crescendo. And on the dark side, the dialogue also suffers from the same disjointedness that the plot does.",
        "I've now watched this series twice and it's even better the second time around. I've been an animation nut since I was a child in the late 50's-early 60's. I've been watching Japanese animation since the 1980's. I just turned 70 and I'm still looking for new stuff. I've seen hundreds of anime pieces and this ranks right up there with some of the best. I'm sure it will become a classic. It sure deserves to be.",
        "As a lover of the art of anime and manga, I found Last Exile beautiful. In particular, its use of CGI for realistic perspective and movement, with hand drawn characters for expressiveness impressed me as masterful. I was grateful for its minimal use of manga clich\u00e9s (exaggerate mouths, slapstick, etc) and moderate cuteness. The composition of scenes, timing, sound affects and music were pleasing to the eye and ear.However, I found a lot to fault in this beautiful series.From a storytelling point of view, there was some disjointedness, especially in the final episode, which IMHO had three of four episodes compressed into a final five minutes, as if planners had expected to have another half or full season to finish the story. There are arguably too many characters and subplots for the limited film minutes to cover. Since anime has a tradition of letting the viewer fill in plot blanks, however, I'm was little bothered by this, deducting at most 1 point out of 10 for it.What bothered me the most about LE is that, like much anime scifi, it's bad science fiction. It's wonderfully realistic look, achieved by its excellent mechanical designs and masterful union of CGI, artwork, makes its bad science even worse by making it less obvious.The worst science of LE is the heart of its fictional technology, claudia engines, AKA claudia boiler, drives, and units. Claudia is a florescent blue crystalline material, mined from underground deposits, that when dissolved in water produces a fluid that provides both thrust and lift for all of LE's flying vehicles, from 2-seat vanships to giant battleships to city-sized ships and citadels. When \"boiled\" under its own power and circulated through coiled pipes, it renders these vehicles effectively lighter than air. In rotating engines resembling WWI rotary piston airplane engines and tailpipes resembling WWII pulsejets, it drives these vehicles through the air at speeds comparable to late WWI aircraft.No known chemical element or compound behaves in this extraordinary manner. In good science fiction, an explanation must be offered. For example, perhaps claudia is not a natural substance, but was artificially deposited in minable deposits during the colonization of Pretale/Prester, using the same technology that built Exile. Though a weak explanation, this is better than the lack of any explanation offered by the series, and far better than the na\u00efve explanation that a substance like claudia could reasonably occur naturally.One could argue that, like LE's plot holes, a science fiction explanation is left to the imagination of the viewer. However, if it's IMDb reviews and polls are an indication, few viewers have.",
        "Last Exile is a masterpiece through and through.The most attention drawing aspect of this series is its incredible animation. It mixes 2d animation with 3d CGI almost perfectly and delivers an explosive, in-your-face presentation that can only be rivaled by feature anime films like Blood: The Last Vampire.The story behind Last Exile is interesting and emotional. The characters are lovable and their interactions are genuinely enjoyable and surprisingly human. The setting is steampunk inspired and meticulously detailed.Overall, one hell of a ride, and easily the best anime I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. This is a must see for not just fans of anime, but fans of excellent storytelling and entertainment in general.",
        "\"Last Exile\" was a series I yearned for for a long time, a story focused on characters and subtly engaged within a profound and fantastical world. However out of a need to finish the plot, the character development necessary to bring the story full circle falls short.I loved this series for really taking the time to show who the characters are and really let them take hold of the story. The tone and pacing of most of the episodes reminded me of the HBO series \"The Wire\" which also let the story fall together one pebble at a time. The series is brilliant for capturing small moments between characters that hint at their growing bonds and frustrations like a scene in a crowded elevator at a casino, a soldier chanting before a battle and when one character puts on the clothes of another in the desert. The two leads Claus and Lavie's relationship portrays itself as a chameleon jumping from comrades to partners, childhood friends, surrogate siblings and repressed lovers. The central bond though lies with Claus and the shy, mysterious girl Alvis who hold and drive the characters and the story together throughout the series.\"Last Exile\" seems quite conventional in terms of plot, but it is only when it supersedes the characters that the series falls flat. For most of the show's running time that does not happen though. It bears a unique sense of drama that I find hard to see in other forms. Nowhere but in anime or Greek tragedy could you a see a person fall in love and heart break in the same moment.",
        "'Last exile' is no extraordinary story. It a good story. The anime has well thought characters and some good episodes. If I were to rate the series in three parts and out of 10 -The first few episodes would be - 8/10 | The episodes in the middle - 6/10 | The last few episodes - 4.5/10So basically, the anime has a great start. An average middle and a sloppy ending. It felt to me like the makers were in some kind of an hurry to finish off the story. There are many, many loose ends. Too many important characters dying and too many unnecessary love connections made. Whereas the main romances are left high and dry. As a viewer I felt empty in the end. Like some major part of the story was 'missing'. This series will, for sure, not be 'remembered'.So, watch it but don't expect satisfaction.",
        "This show simple as a story goes really does shine against a lot of television from any part of the world. Rescent and old.It's timeless animation that I can see in 15 years time still being rather awe inspiring.The music is amazing. Why do the OST's have to be so hard to get? Dolce TRiade is amazing and for the artist first score I think it's an great achievement.The story is very special. It's full on from the get go and not a second is spared.At first I hesitated to buy this show and got the box on a whim. I was kind of skeptical after the first disc but as I bought them all I was never regretting the purchase.I may be paid to influence people to but but \"gto people\" buy this because you will not regret it.",
        "The truly interesting thing with Last Exile is how it has stolen from everything imaginable. So much so that it has to be on purpose. Plot points from Robotech, style from everything by Miyazaki san, ideas coming everywhere from Tenchi Muyo to Speed Racer, and characters from all the venerable old classics. (Could Alex be more Captain Harlock? Could Alvis be more Sasami? I defy you to argue this.) I could go on and on and on about the things this stole. Even a fighter scene right out of Return of the Jedi. Unbelievable!But it does it all so well.I couldn't have enjoyed this more. Most of the CGI animation is very seamlessly integrated with the Cell animation in a way that they seem to get better at every year. Even if stolen the story is interesting and draws you in. I truly care about each of the characters and most of them are fairly multi- dimensional (at least as far as Anime standards go.)I highly recommend this. Particularly if you have an extensive Anime background and can look for all the references. On the down side I think there were way too many female characters, which is about standard for this kind of Anime. Also, there are a few CGI scenes that I don't think look good enough for a series of this high quality. Minor complaints.Don't rent the first DVD if your video rental place doesn't have the complete set. You will be extremely frustrated when you realize that you simply MUST watch the whole series right away!",
        "The first thing that strikes you when watching this anime series is that the world of \"Last Exile\" is much like ours \u0096 yet very, very different. That, in essence, is the magic and appeal of the story.Imagine this world structured like a chess game: two diametrically opposite races \u0096 each with its own territory separated by a gulf, both engaged in mortal combat overseen by a race of neutral arbitrators dictating the rules of the game.Next throw in two teenage orphans, Claus and Lavie, who own a bi-plane sort of rickety flying contraption called a Vanship, and who run a courier service delivering mail. Here's the catch, the Vanship has no wings but uses a chemical called \"Cloudia\" for levitation and propulsion. In fact, even the flying battleships manned by both of the two races: the Anatoray (who resemble Victorian age West Europeans) and the Disith (dressed much like post revolution Russians), are propelled by the same mechanism. But while powerful, these lumbering behemoths are no match for the seemingly invincible Guild ships that are light years ahead in technology and whose overt purpose is to ensure that both parties play by the rules \u0096 or else.The plot swings into full gear in the second episode when Claus and Lavie, during a Vanship race, pick up a little girl called Alvis from a Vanship crippled by a Guild \"star\" ship. They are entrusted by the dying Vanship pilot to deliver her safely to her destination and so begins their great adventure and rite of passage. In the process, they are swept up by the politics of this world and the players of this dangerous game of covert interests and hidden agendas.Almost immediately, the viewer is posed with the following few questions: why are these two races fighting? What is this gulf called the \"Grand Stream\" that separates the lands of the Anatoray and Disith? Why is the Guild acting as judge and executioner? Why is Alvis so important that the Guild would have her captured \u0096 dead or alive? These are (almost too) slowly revealed, one cliffhanger episode at a time.Produced by Japan's Gonzo animation studios (www.gonzo.co.jp), famous for such breakthrough anime series as \"Hellsing\" and \"Blue Submarine No. 6\", \"Last Exile\" brings together the best in anime storytelling, traditional as well as computer generated 3-D animation, unpredictable plot twists, likable characters, imaginative soundtrack (by Dolce Triade), comedy and tragedy, hope and despair \u0085 all in a symphony of flawless execution.The attention to detail in this series is characteristically Japanese \u0096 simply amazing. One such example is that writers (Kouichi Chigira, Atsuhiro Tomioka, Shuichi Kamiyama and Tomohiro Yamashita) have intricately woven in the chess theme into the story: by naming each episode after a different chess move, scenes of intense discussion over chess matches, and a plot twist featuring the promotion of a pawn to a queen.Like a piece of complex origami that starts out looking like a flower \u0096 \"Last Exile\" \u0096 with each plot unfolding reveals its hidden gems and slowly but surely wraps up into a form so unlike its beginning that the viewer is left to marvel at the inventiveness and dedication of its creators \u0085 while simply enjoying the ride.",
        "This review is based on the English dubbed version and may contain very minor spoilers.Last Exile is a wonderful series that takes place in a world that appears to be an alternate reality that is similar in appearance to 19th century Earth. The whole thing just oozes quality in nearly every aspect.I'm not in any way shape or form an expert in animation, but even so I can say with some confidence that visually this is a masterpiece. While I find it very pleasing to the eyes all around, I have to say that the CGI scenes, most notably the battles, are exceptionally well done. They transition seamlessly from CGI to normal animation and integrate everything very well without ever having it smack you in the face with a jarring change. Last Exile prevails in that respect where a number of other anime titles have failed.The soundtrack matches the visuals tit for tat and compliments them very well. The music is charged for the battles and more subtle for the more tender scenes all while staying with the sort of classical meets modern theme of the show.The English voice actors consisted of some of the best in the business and they turned out very good performances all around. Johnny Yong Bosch plays the lead male Claus and manages to keep the voice youthful without being too high pitched or whiny. Kari Walhgren's Lavie is probably the weakest link for me; not because of poor acting abilities though, since you can feel the emotions coming across as you should. I simply find her voice somewhat shrill and screech-like.The supporting cast voicing is very strong as well with some highlights in particular. Michelle Ruff played both the adorable Alvis and the rigid Tatiana. Her Alvis was cute and very Chi-like which was fitting for the character while her Tatiana seemed stilted at first but improved quite a bit as the series went on. Though, she may have done this on purpose to help show the change of personality that Tatiana went though. Others of note were Joshua Seth's Dio who came off as child-like and carefree and fit the character pretty well and Steven Jay Blum's Vincent who sounded like, well like Steven Jay Blum. He usually sounds pretty much the same in everything but that's OK when you sound like he sounds. In fact, I wouldn't have minded having him and Crispin Freeman switching roles in this series. While I found nothing all that bad about Freeman's dark and brooding Alex Row I think Blum's voice would have been a better fit for the character.The story, ah the story; unfortunately this is what kept it just shy of being great. Don't get me wrong; what's there is very well done. The problem is that even though the show has finished, the story isn't complete. I was watching and watching, wondering when the answers would come. Soon the series was nearly over so now I'm thinking well this must be one of those shows that weaves a story loosely together and then ties it up tight with an episode or two in the end; that's cool. Then the final episode came and went and still I was left with many important questions unanswered as well as a few new ones.The one other aspect of the story that I didn't particularly care for was the awkward romantic angle that seemed to come out of nowhere. All of a sudden, boom, there's this love triangle thing going on that never really goes anywhere. It all seemed pretty pointless in the end. The only purpose for it I see was that of a catalyst for Tatiana's character growth. That could have been handled any number of ways, though. Now I'm all for romance, I love love, but if you're going to do it then do it right. Make it a full blown sub-plot or at least let us know how it might turn out; don't just start the engine and let it sit there until it runs out of gas.So there's the bad; where's the good? Well the characters are all well done and likable, unless you're not meant to like them. Even Dio, who at first seems to be kind of an effeminate weirdo, (and he is), but by the end of the series you really feel for the guy. There is great character development for most of the characters. The main characters certainly run their course but the, \"lesser\", characters aren't just there taking up space either; you actually get to know and relate to them. Mullin, for example, was probably my favorite character in the show and while he didn't get much screen time at all in comparison to other characters he shows a surprising amount of depth and growth.All in all Last Exile was extremely good from beginning to end, although the end did feel a bit rushed. With spectacular audio and visuals, a story that pulls you in and makes you care about the characters and the world they're in, it seems to have everything a great show needs. Well, almost everything. With just a couple more episodes to fill in some fairly important story gaps it could have been truly great.",
        "I recently finished watching this 26 episode TV series,twice,and I will be watching it again soon. Last Exile,is Gonzo Studio's 10 th anniversary Vanity project and their efforts to make it something special shows.Take an epic story,characters you can care about,a fantastic score by Dolce Triad,production design that could teach George Lucas and ILM lessons, and then add some of the finest integration of hand drawn and computer animation through Gonzo's patented Gonzo Digimation that is nothing short of amazing. This is a TV series with Movie Quality Work.Anime fans and critics have been raving about this series for good reason.     Last Exile is an Action ,Adventure, Romance, Retro Sci-fi, Fantasy Epic that tells the story of Claus Valca and Lavie Head,two couriers, who are swept in events that change the fate of their world,Prestale.Prestale is a world where two great Kingdoms,Disith and Anatoray, are locked in war fought in the skies by the massive air battleships that are fantastic.The battles are supposed be fought by the rule of Chivalry as supervised by the \"neutral\" Guild.Clause and Lavie while delivering a message to the Flagship of the Commander of the Anatorey are witness to a change that shows something has changed and not for better.Shortly afterwards , they find themselves taking over a mission from a dying Van ship pilot to deliver a little girl,Alvis Hamilton, to the Rogue Battleship Silvana.Who is Alvis Hamilton, and why is it that people will kill to posess her? What is the Significance of the Interferrance of the Guild in the struggle between Disith and Anatoray? Why is Prestale Dying? Well,you'll just have to watch and find out by yourself.Take it from me this is a journey worth taking.",
        "My girlfriend and I caught this series on 'Tech TV' during a Sunday marathon. We were drawn to the compelling story line, Intelligent characters and fantastic visuals. We were so drawn that we went out and found it on DVD at a good video store so we could watch it again.It does bear a passing resemblance to \"Castle in the Clouds\", but with a more 'grown-up' sensibility. It's a shame episodes 14 through 26 will not be available to be shown on TV until next year, it's going to be a long wait.Tech TV has previews of the various episodes if you want to take a closer look.Update: Saw the last 13 episodes, and the pace of the series grows more relentless until the tension is almost unbearable for the last four episodes. Excellent story arc, and some very affecting tragedy at the end. Strongly recommended to any interested in a good story, strong characters, and inheritable visuals should check this series out.",
        "First, heads-off for the beautiful graphic scenery proposed by the authors. Regardless of the TV/Video set that you'll use to go through the 26 episodes of \"Last Exile\" series, you ought to be amazed with the excellent quality of the graphic design, the advanced & thoughtful choices of the universe that has been created here. Honestly, it is worth watching that series just for the graphic sake of it.Besides, the story, though it might be a bit \"already seen before\" is pretty easy to follow and won't let you down. It depicts a war times between 2 conflicting races that are indeed both under the control of a 3rd species called \"The Guild\".Though the characters are a bit \"simples\" in their definition (this is where you realized that this series was aimed at young people), it is a 8 out 10 animated series that you want to watch.",
        "Last Exile has to be one of the best anime series I have ever seen. It's imaginative and inspiring. It's truly worth seeing! Just when it seemed like anime series seemed to be coming from a cookie cutter type mold; Last Exile came and broke it. You can't help, but become involved in such a well written, well directed, and well animated story. The character development is superb. Each character's stories, their ambition's, their reason's being, for doing what they do, living or dying, are deep. It's happy, gloomy, funny, sad, touching, exciting, vengeful, and romantic. There's something for everyone, who watches this series. This series takes you for an adventure you'll never forget! And when you're done, you'll never look at the sky the same again. You'll wish you were flying in it.",
        "Overall I'd say this is a great series, a solid 8 out of 10.The biggest strength for the series is by far the amazing artwork and animation. Reminiscent of Miyazaki's \"Castle in the Sky\", the steam punk airship technology are all interestingly designed and are beautifully translated onto the screen. Character animation is very solid, the studio clearly didn't try to cut corners, which provides expression and life to the characters. Top notch stuff all aroundThe first half of the series had me completely hooked, particularly the first two episodes. I totally bought into the steam punk tech especially. The characters that were introduced were likable and their motivations (or lack thereof in some cases) were clear. The scene was set for some epic reveals and an exciting ride. However, I felt that the pacing of the second half of the story was sorely lacking. I found myself begin to lose interest at times, even as things began to unfold. Not to say it wasn't competently done, but from the expectations I had from the first half, it didn't pay off the way I wanted it to. The art and animation is incredible and the story is well above most others, give it a watch.",
        "Last Exile is a unique piece of art. The show showcases the events in a (fantastic and very original) world almost torn apart by fully organized battles gone wrong. The animation is top-notch while the dramatic score really moves you in on the action scenes, which, as intense as they can get, really have more than just an ordinary conclusion to them. I simply loved the way characters were introduced and how they all developed over the episodes. In fact they developed well even over the course of one episode. Plus the dialogue isn't just rubbish to rush the plot along, but rather it is well-crafted and thought provoking during several conversations. Overall this anime series really goes to show what you can achieve by putting together wonderful characters and story to match with its great, almost epic, animation (which is the best I've seen in any anime to date). Score: 10/10",
        "It is a rare anime series that requires 26 episodes to tell its story well. Most could do with half that number, as much of the time directors and writers stray too far from the plot line itself into meaningless subplots. However, Last Exile is one of the few, if one of the only, series I have watched that merits more than the allotted number. Last Exile does not find itself bogged down in side-stories - there are no side stories in Last Exile - everything matters, down to the very last second of the show. In a way, this is why the show needed 30 episodes rather the allotted 26. The last episode especially shows that the creative team had so much more to tell, but just didn't have the space. Because of this, the ending may seem rushed and unfulfilling, which it is. However, all of this fails to noticeably detract from GONZO's masterpiece.As with the majority of anime series, the plot line of Last Exile is simple and, to say the least, predictable. What separates anime from traditional American shows is the level of emphasis put on characters and the emotional connections between them. With its fair share of tragedy, the characters in Last Exile do not disappoint, right down to the very last moment. From the strength of deep ties of friendship to the incredible power of revenge, Last Exile presents the emotions of each character so powerfully it compels the viewer to understand and accept them. These characters are what will, someday when the animation is dated and the audio considered choppy, tie to the viewer to the series and draw them back for more.",
        "This was at first one of the oddest (in a wonderful way) things I had seen in some time, with a cute cast and what is appearing to be a wonderful storyline, thoughtful and yet complex. I guess the action effects are either real video overlaid with drawings or something, or they are more likely computer graphics. The character interaction is good old cel looking stuff, which adds a feeling of warmth to it overall. Seeing wingless planes, and ships \"sinking\" into the clouds when hit, kinda reminded me of StarBlazers, but that soon gave way to the fact that this is WAY beyond that. With old masters, watching things from above (adds destiny) and people in colonial uniforms, with blasters and such (and old style guns and so on, brings together old and new in a way that has me quite hooked. Looks I am going to be up all night for a few weeks watching this one :)"

    "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood": [
        "There is a lot to like about the anime series Full Metal Alchemist. For starters: the alchemy and alchemists. They not only stay true to what alchemy really is per definition--a form of chemistry and speculative philosophy practiced in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and concerned principally with discovering methods for transmuting baser metals into gold and with finding a universal solvent and an elixir of life--but they expand a bit on it with the principal of \"equivalent exchange\". The simple explanation of \"equivalent exchange\" is that in order to create something you have to give up or sacrifice something of equal value. Basically, you can't create something out of nothing. It was a blast seeing alchemy and the alchemists at work. They were nearly wizards or superheroes even with their skills.Beyond the alchemy and the various alchemists was the quest of Edward and Alphonse Elric to reunite Alphonse's soul with his body. Their journey led them all over the place all the while they discovered more hidden truths and a major sinister plot. Then, separate from the Elric brothers' quest was a larger scheme involving the country of Amestris, immortality and god-like powers. The main story and all of the smaller stories within the series were great. And they didn't drag the series on too long. They made sure to actually conclude the saga instead of having the Elric's interminably roaming the earth looking for an answer. I love that the show's creators did that. A show such as this--one that has a definite goal--has to conclude. I've seen other shows in which they come up with dumber and dumber ways to keep the show going by denying the main character the completion of his quest. Shows like that get tired and old real quick.So, there is a lot to like about Full Metal Alchemist like I said--which leads me to the small bit that I didn't like. I became real annoyed with the morals of the Elrics and other \"good guys\". Were their morals bad? No, just juvenile and childlike in their simplicity. There were two things in particular. 1.) Their concept of all life being sacred regardless of who's or what life it is. They took it to such an extreme that they were willing to sacrifice themselves to save those who were clearly their enemies. There was even one scene in which one of the protagonists pulled a gun on her friend to save a homunculus (artificially created being). Quite literally it would be like a wife pulling a gun on her husband to prevent him from killing the creature that murdered their child. Really?! Would you kill your own friend to save some other creature just because it has life? That's a hypocritical and oxymoronic action if there ever was one. Let me kill this guy to prevent him from killing a killer!!!!??? Supposedly she did it because she wanted to prevent her good friend from going to the darkside (in a manner of speaking) by letting his anger control him in that moment. People get angry, especially with those who've killed their loved ones. Why deny him that outlet, even if it results in the killing of the killer? Do these moralistic pollyanas believe that somehow a person can control their anger if denied the opportunity to seek revenge? I think quite the opposite. If someone killed a loved one of mine and I could get the chance to end his life that would bring me a least some semblance of closure. Conversely, if I had the opportunity and was denied it because of someone's warped belief that it would \"make me no better than him\" then it would only cause me to be more angry. Because now, in this highly unjust scenario, I have a dead loved one and the killer still breathes. Yes, this is my opinion and I know not everyone would agree. But I feel strongly about not denying someone a chance at their vengeance. How often must victims be chided for wanting justice? It may be considered a human frailty by some but even still, let it be the choice of the wronged person to forgive or not.2.) I took exception with the belief of some of the characters that they could, or even had to, save everyone. To begin with, it is the utmost of arrogance to believe that you can save everyone. Secondly, it is a farce to even believe that everyone deserves to be saved. I don't mean this in an economic sense or a social sense, but in the sense of just good and bad. Of course everyone has a different gauge of good and bad but I'd consider murderers and would be murderers bad, yet some of the protagonists saw that they needed to save them as well.Even with those nauseating moments of saintly altruism that were rather sophomoric in practice I liked the show. It was heavy at times and light at times to keep a balance. The heavy moments, which were reserved for some sort of lesson, seemed after-school special like--like they were spoon feeding you what you should understand from this moment. There were other heavy moments that were done more properly where I didn't think the message was overly sappy. Overall it was a well done anime. It'd be nice if they could reboot it with another quest for the Elrics.",
        "I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to anime, I've seen a few but I'm still finding my feet. I was always told FMA is considered one of the top series and though I enjoyed it I wasn't blown away.FMA: Brotherhood however I found to be considerably better though the fact the same show was remade by the same studio and with the same voice cast baffled me. Now pardon my ignorance but the way I understand it the original series was an adaptation whereas Brotherhood was a loyal version of the original Manga?Regardless I consider to it to be considerably better. The character development seems rushed initially but quickly finds its pace, new additions bring a lot to the story and the actual story arc itself is on a far grander scale.Based on this I can only assume there was a lot of frustration with the original series as it can't have been considered a true adaptation of the source material. We're not talking minor differences here we're talking a different show altogether and certainly a heavily modified plot by comparison.The stellar voice cast, great animation, gripping story and excellent characters clung to me whereas the original series didn't and I fully understand why many told me it was the superior choice.Powerful, fascinating and devastating in places FMA: Brotherhood was a really enjoyable ride that I'm glad I was part of.The Good:Perfect voice castGreat charactersPowerful moving plot throughoutMore consistent in quality than the original seriesThe Bad:Couple of weak episodesRushed beginningI still HATE the over the top facial expressions that break from the anime styleThings I Learnt From This Series:Anyone who wants you to call them \"F\u00fchrer\" is probably up to no goodEnvy is what is known as a \"Trap\" right?Sometimes dead is better (I totally said that in Fred Gwynnes voice)Kids should drink their milk!",
        "In a world where magic exists in the hands of specialised 'state alchemists' (and the occasional villain or renegade), two young brothers become involved in a complex plot to supplant the human race with synthetic humanoids called 'homunculi'. The 64 chapter anime series features numerous subplots and dozens of characters, excellent animation and a compelling storyline. I am not an aficionado of anime but I found this series to be extremely entertaining (although the inexplicable (at least to me) transitions between animation styles was very odd).",
        "The plot is pretty much the same as last time. For those who didn't read my review from last of the original series. I'll give a brief refresher for what the series is about.After their father Van Holnhian left his family, his wife Trisha suddenly catches an illness causing her to die. Leaving her two sons Edward and his younger brother Alphonse to look after themselves. The both go to an alchemy teacher to use knowledge as an attempt to bring back their mom. But at a terrible price. Alphonse loses his entire body and is forced have his sole inside an armour and Edward lost both his arms and legs. They now have to find a way to get their bodies back. Now they are member of the military. Little do they know there is a lot of corruption and it's secrets.For those of you who are probably wondering. Yes I do find this a lot better then the original series. That isn't to say the original show wasn't bad I just personally find this series to be a lot more accurate to the Manga then the original.The newer and up to date animation from bones is a good example of how fair the series has came.The dub cast include Vic Mignoga as Edward Elric did an amazing job as the protagonist himself (Shame on you Funimation for ruining his life). Alongside Caitlin Glass as the beautiful Winary Rochbell and Maxey Whitehead as Alphonse even though I was upset his previous actor didn't come back as he hit before recording but Maxey was an excellent replacement. Everyone else include Todd Haberkorn, Troy Baker, Kenny Green, Trina Nishimura, J. Michael Tatum, Ed Bladlock (RIP), Jerry Russel (RIP), Travis Willingram, John Swasey, Tia Ballard, Barry Yandal, Bob Carter, Stephanie Young and others all did a fantastic job. Please don't listen to the pathic dub hating trolls slandering the dub or KickVic SJW's in the reviews.Also I really love the sound tracks for both the ending and the intro.If you are a fan of the original and wasn't that satisfied about please check out this series.",
        "I fully enjoyed the original FMA since episode 1. It was well thought out. However, Brotherhood is the completely opposite. Since the storyline completely rushed, it does not allow for explanation. I was really looking forward to watching this new version, but Brotherhood is a disappointment for me. The characters are very simple, the plot is predictable, and the art design is very ordinary. The argument seems poor to me and the characters do not grow, they do not have a significant abance, it is all flat. They represent litterally one personality except Homheim and homucolus (Bradley, Father, pride, Envy, greed) they are actually very great characters but they got bad character treatment.Even though the show has no low points, there are really no real high points ever. It's kinda of just a flatline for a majority of it. Everything is serviceable. It checked off all the marks for the most crowd pleasing show. It was about episode 40/41 that I realized that there is no real threat to lives of our heroes(even Chimeras), Nobody dies, except one person (Briggs Officer) that we don't really care about. Overpowered Villains suddenly aren't that powerful, a Good example of it is Pride, he was unbelievably Powerful and then he is completely helpless against Al even though Kimberly is helping him as well.Even in serious scenes, there is a lot of comedy just thrown in there. Which is odd, for how dark the subject material is in the series. I kinda enjoy and not enjoy it at the same time because of its good themes and unique story while bad execution.",
        "This show is the best. Amazing characters, story, humor, and drama. Just the best.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of those shows that you watch not knowing quite what to expect at first; you watch the show some more and see that it is a fairytale for the modern age, influenced by the works of Mike Mignola, steampunk fiction, and has the escapism of the Harry Potter series.Fullmetal Alchemist is an epic tale of family, supernaturalism, men who want to play god, and characters who want to make amends for their past. It is a beautiful show, surprisingly moving, populated with deep and lovable characters whose stories all intertwine with another somewhere down the line.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an absolute classic on the highest level imaginable: the story is outstanding, the animation lively and gorgeous, the music sweeping, and the characters are so diverse and individual in their own right that you never get bored when one episode focuses on a supporting character; there is always something new to show.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an experience in its own right, and one that will surely stand the test of time.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist has become a widely-loved classic in the anime medium, and that's because it's one of those shows that can appeal to those who aren't strict fans of Japanese cartoons in general: it's a paradox show that can appeal to anime's most staunchly harsh critics, and subvert their expectations with its potent storytelling on brotherhood, magic, genocide, parenthood and the loss of innocence. P.S. What is it about animation and losing a parent that comes so hand-in-hand in animated storytelling?Fullmetal Alchemist is a science-fantasy gem and its A+++ caliber storytelling show that anime can be compared to the greatest of live-action television dramas. Fullmetal Alchemist can be enjoyed by the same demographic of people who watch shows like Game of Thrones or fans of the Harry Potter movies (like myself); it also has the same familial themes and values that makes similarly great franchises so timeless. The Elric Brothers are not your typical television/film siblings you'll expect to see; they're a totally different game whom accurately capture what it is (and what it takes) to be brothers.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is wonderful; in every sense of the word. Give it a watch.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was very pleasant to watch. Loved everything about it.First off, the series has a huge cast of interesting & unique characters. They are each quite different from each other, and act in different ways. The way the series elegantly manages all the character's developments and story lines is a feat in itself. The series also has a fantastically crafted plot, filled with action, humor, & tragedy.The animation and art is top notch. The production values are great. The soundtrack is excellent as well, particularly the opening & closing sequences that accompany each episode.It goes on for 64 episodes & maintains your attention the entire time. It even manages to close everything up in a satisfying manner. A fantastic series.",
        "I was immensely impressed with the 2003 adaptation, especially because most of its story was original and not entirely based on the manga, which is a big deal on the creative front. And as I finally finished watching Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood last night, I was left smiling and satisfied to a degree that hasn't yet been achieved by any other anime I've seen so far. The final act of the series, especially, gives blockbuster live-action MOVIES a run for the money, delivering god tier emotions and action.Renaming this otherwise similarly titled adaptation Brotherhood was a great decision, because the relationship of the Elric brothers is still a major driving force and their \"brotherhood\" is a treat to watch. This is a very atypical shounen when you look at the tone and tropes. The protagonists have a goal, but it much different when you compare it to other shounen anime where training and improvement are the common tropes. This is very much a mature anime even grown ups can fully enjoy, and the balanced tones between dark and extremely funny are very well balanced.After all, Edward's funny face keeps making appearances more frequently this time.Since I first watched the 2003 version first, the initial few episodes of FMAB felt quite fast paced and like a quick summary of the former in a way. However, it slowly developed into a different story and from that point there was no looking back. The plotting is excellent, and even the two filler episodes are a treat to watch. The voice acting is still strong here, and the characters, especially the Elric brothers, Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, Scar and Fuhrer Bradley shine to their fullest. A cute and rather notable addition is Mei Chang and her tiny pet panda Xiao-Mei. However, I was most impressed with the characterization of Hohenheim, who didn't feel that impactful in the 2003 version. Here, his character is explored fully and with subtlety, and with time I found him one of the best things about the show.And of course, the action. It is simply outstanding. Some of the fight scenes are so intensely drawn and chaotically edited that they given some serious competition to live-action fights. The final arc of the show is filled with some of the greatest fights and blockbuster moments you will ever experience in an anime or live-action work. The music is similarly apt and a treat to the ears. And again, while there are a lot of dark moments like 2003, this adaptation also adds more hilarity, as a result of which I ended up laughing far more than expected. I have to commend them also for experimenting and adding humor even in the most serious moments, which is something a lot of writers are skeptical of.And guess what else left me speechless? That a shounen like this, where both male and female characters are equally capable and strong, is the work of a woman. Hiromu Arakawa truly has my respect for understanding both genders and delivering a highly intelligent, memorable, haunting and exciting story which is really hard to top. Once you watch this anime, your expectations and standards are going to shoot up. I loved it to the fullest and I would love to add it to my collection, along with the 2003 version of course.",
        "A wonderful anime, but the recent episodes disappointed me greatly, as the balance of power was no longer logical, and the comedy in the anime was not funny and very provocative and the change in the style of the drawing in the comic scenes separated me from the atmosphere of the anime. Absolutely, the anime story was excellent, the fights are great.",
        "I thought that this was one of the most balanced shows out there, in terms of plot complexity, storytelling, humor, action, fan-service, philosophy/science, war, nationalism, etc. You think this is a fantasy show, and then it changes genres 3x (in a good way) as things slowly unravel. Good animation, good music, great edits in jumping back and forth between scenes and timelines.While there isn't any suspense, there's a good amount of conspiracies, twists and turns that you don't see coming. And there's enough going on to keep you curious to see what's about to happen. The show was thrilling, thought-provoking and moving at the same time.The show isn't about ONE protagonist, like a DbZ or a Naruto is. It doesn't come with a disclaimer like \"The show is epic up to when L and Kira fight it out\" that Death Note comes with.This is also a good anime to get your kids into anime with, of course, once they in their teens and can understand what's going on.",
        "At first I was going to say that once you got past the first few episodes the series truly began to become amazing, but upon further thought I take that back. This show is powerful from the very beginning, and while the first few episodes aren't as addicting as the later episodes of the series, they are beyond a doubt powerful enough to get you interested. In fact, the first 4 or so episodes have plenty of scenes and themes that can be quite disturbing and memorable. Once you get past the first few introductory episodes, the plot really starts to become addicting (specifically after a certain event which those who have watched the show can probably guess what I'm talking about) and it becomes really hard to not want to keep watching episode after episode to further the plot.Since this is the \"Complete Collection One\" of two of FMA Brotherhood, that means that you only get half of the episodes in this collection. Considering you get over 30 episodes, this is actually a pretty hefty collection and definitely has a sizable amount of content in relationship to the price.So, in short, Brotherhood is a fantastic and memorable series that doesn't last long enough to run itself dry, and the first collection you see here is a great way to become addicted to the story of the Elric brothers.",
        "I just finished FMAB and I have to say it was so well made. Most of the character was flushed out and had their backstories and goals. The world building was so vast and expansive you can do a whole analysis on that such as the cultures, people, beliefs, and nations. The themes Fullmetal explored was also fantastic such as war, man's inhumanity to man , personal struggle the characters faced, and understanding morality. The author of Fullmetal really put a lot of effort into making Fullmetal. The art, animation, and music was a big plus for this anime also. The comedy in this anime was well done and funny as hell, the funniest anime I have ever watched. The tone and the vibe was very nice also, at times it would get dark but I would be lifted by the comedy. But at times they mixed the comedy with the fights which was suppose to be serious and dark. The story was well done and nothing seemed out of place or didn't make sense.The fights were confusing at times, half the time in the fights the good guys and bad guys were talking too each other way too much and other times they wont even talk and just start fighting. Another things is the pacing, I felt like the creators should have done a better job on shedding Ed's and Al's younger years and their troubles when they first joined the military and also the other characters also. My last problem was the consistency such as keeping the same music people enjoy alot to become a nostalgia for example keeping the same opening instead of it changing every time. And also doing a better job of making the audience care for the characters by doing a better job on the emotional scenes, their origins, and their dialogue.So overall I enjoyed the show, it wasn't a masterpiece to say oh I will remember this show for the rest of my life, or bad to say that I'm never going to watch this show again . FMAB put a lot of passion into the visuals, story, and music which was a big plus because I enjoyed those aspects alot. But I think they could have done a better job in certain scenes and could have made the characters even more interesting and memorable then where they are right now.Memorable: Sort of Rewatchable: Likely..",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the second time that the manga is adapted in a series after the 2003 series, which is also really good though it differs greatly from the source material. No I don't say FMA (addreaviation for Full Metal Alchemist) is bad, but against the remastered 2009 series it doesn't stand a chance.As I first saw FMA and after Brotherhood I will compare these two a lot.So the story begins with the two brothers Alphonse and Edward Elirc ,who after their try in human transmutation in order to bring their mother back to life failed, Al lost his body and Ed an arm and a leg and the how it is well known for anyone who has seen the series or read the manga. So they embark on a mission to get their bodies back to normal, by finding the infamous Philosopher Stone. What I loved with Brotherhood is that it is really fast pasted and you never feel bored and as for the filler, almost none. And as for the characters, are pitch perfect from Mustang to Lin and all the Homonculi except from Lust ,who had a bigger role in the 2003 series.As for the strengths of the series ,the map is more fleshed out with a lot more back story ,lore and even myths, in the series we explore much more of Amestris and the we see the Wall and the older sister of Alex LouisArmstrong ,Olivier one of the most bad ass character and she is as stun and hardcore as her brother is goofy and hilarious. Some other great characters is Lin , one of the princes of Yin who tries to find a mean to win the throne and his bodyguards. But I want to focus on Lin more for he gets from an arrogant and somewhat annoying prince to a mature and responsible adult ,who is fully capable to lead his country, I guess the experience of fighting superhuman creatures and sharing his body with Greed make him more amiable. As for Greed and Scar had a complete 180 degree change and I have to mourn a character so much since the Red Wedding.To return to our brothers Al is saved by Ed much less and his Alchemic skills get much enhanced and to his older shorter (hahahahahaha) brother he is more mature and he never lose focus of his goals. And his romance with Winry is totally heartfelt ,sincer and real and their last photo with their kids was adorable.My last paragraph it is going to be of the antagonists of the series ,Father and his kids , apart from Greed and Lust. Father is one of the most arrogant ,over powered character in anime history and complete disregard for the humans makes him even more abhorrent ,but not as his first born son Pride ,who was twice as hated by me from his father due to his Arrogance and it felt good to see him get mashed from some puny humans. As for Glottuny he was funny and creepy at the same time. King Bradey ,Wrath was an extremely well-written and interesting villain and he is my second favorite of the Homonculi after Greed. Sloth was just their (ok you can;t give to every character, depth) .Finally Envy was an**** a-hole and its demise was quit fitting.All in all it is must was and if you have to choose between the FMA and Brotherhood ,the later is so good I forgot the 2003 series existed and closed the story much better than the 2003 with the Conquest of Samballa (man it was disappointing).",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a really solid anime. It has great art and character design. It has a memorable OST, and an amazing story. By far the best part about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the story. It's not only creative, but it has a deep lore, and the writers have no problem going into that lore. And I always found myself wanting to learn more about the Fullmetal Alchemist universe.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is known for having the best dub of all time, and I completely agree with that statement. I usually avoid dubs, but this is one of those rare occurrences where I recommend checking out the dub. The action in this show is the best action I've seen in an anime so far. The action is easy to follow, it looks smooth, and most importantly, It's entertaining.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the best animes of all time, so therefore, it's a must watch. It can get a little repetitive at times, especially near the end, but overall, it's a very well made anime.",
        "Rating 8.8I get why people say it's the greatest Shonen, however to me it lacks that masterpiece factor that makes it memorable. It's exceptional but very traditional in how it ends on a conventional happy note. It has a lot of cliches/generic tropes but is still a solid show all around.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is without a doubt one of my favorite animes!The two brothers have such a strong bond and work together perfectly as a team.Her intention to find the philosopher's stone in order to retrieve Alphonse's body is brilliantly written, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like an easy task.On their way, the brothers encounter many obstacles, most of which are personified in the form of homoculuses.The anime contains funny but also very serious and shocking moments.The plot twists are also presented exceptionally well.The anime also has an intro that I just couldn't skip.Clear recommendation on my part!",
        "There is no lack of originality on quality anime, the sheer amount of three dimensional characters, twists and creativity puts this art form at the same level of TV and movies.Full Metal Alchemist takes place in a world where a powerful science by the name of alchemy, allows for some individuals to transform the existing matter into different objects of shapes and sizes limited only by the imagination. It follows the story of two brothers who after performing a tabu experiment with alchemy lose parts of their body - Edward loses an arm and a leg, and Alphonse loses his entire body, while Edward was able to place his soul into an armor - and thus begin their quest into recovering what they lost. Just with this, the story is already original and probably very different than anything you've heard before, as it develops we are presented with a huge conspiracy which slowly makes the connection between Ed and Al journey and the faith of the world they live in.FMA has a lot of incredible achievements, it is beautifully made (in no occasion the animations felt weird even in fast motions such as battles), the journey and how the dots connect are really well done considering the size of the plot and of course, probably its best strength, the amount of characters (and not just simple by standers) that we get to know and that influence the protagonists on their journey. It's difficult to mention more without getting into spoilers, but both Ed and Al are about to embark on a life changing adventure, fueled by the curiosity to seek more knowledge and of course the urge to have their lives back to the normal they once had.Adding to the above, we are also confronted with some interesting ideas and messages conveyed by the story, one example is the Ishval war coming very closely to a lot of actual real life war settings, specially with the Second World War and the consequences of such events and how the inhabitants of different countries in conflict perceive each other.Also, a lot of philosophical subjects are allowed for some space in the show, the dangerous of pure belief in science advancement and the sacrifices on humanity that we are prepared to do in the name of it, questioning what actually makes a human if not simply the physical materials that constitute us what would actually be what we metaphorically call the \"soul\"?\nThese are just some of the on point topics that FMA brings to the table, among political corruption, human greed and other \"sins\", it is very rare we see such a huge plot capable of bringing all of this into a not so long narrative.The only criticism I will make is in the actual end, the main antagonist and his motives can of course be left for interpretation but they didn't quite convice me, I read some analysis and reviews afterwards, and I get the grasp of what the writer intended, yet I wasn't fully satisfied with it - but again, this is a good example where the journey is better than the actual outcome, and aside from this small details I really enjoyed the ending!",
        "I would rate this TV series as easily one of the best ever made. Period. Character development is unsurpassed and rivaled by few. Given the size of the series, clocking at 64 episodes, it's a great achievement. The artistic quality is also way above average with very good animation and moderate level of detail.This series is also more entertaining and easier to understand than other masterpieces of serial animation (such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Serial Experiments Lain and Haibane Renmei), hence I recommend this series to a wider spectrum than the specialists in Japanese animation. A must watch for everybody.",
        "Fullmetal alchemist Brothethood is one of the best if not the best shows I've ever seen. Everything from Animation to music is top class. It has some of the best written and most memorable characters ever. A very deep, engaging and interesting story. I honestly have nothing negative to say about it. It's a must watch.",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood stands among some of the greatest animated TV shows of all time. With character arcs lasting seasons that pay off perfectly, a score that sets the tone for the show as extremely dark but also far from hopeless and creative animation that makes this world stand out from others. Brotherhood also offers some of the best action in anime, with incredibly brutal deaths as well as extremely disturbing moments almost as soon as you jump into the show. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood will rank as one of my favorite TV shows of all time.",
        "It's waring on my patience, the more character's that get introduced, the pointless conversations, -completely- pointless sub-plots. It feels like a lot of this show is either localized in an incredibly contrived way, or there's quite a lot of filler.Still, I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons (or Parts as Netflix is calling them) and due to the love this series has gotten I'll keep trying to watch. Not a -true- anime fan - I like Bebop, NG:E, Akira, took the chance on this and loved the charm and bounciness of the the plot of this show. I'll edit this if my opinon changes in some major way.",
        "Japanese television \ud83d\udcfa series translated and voiced over to english. Wow! I'm telling you, you'll change your life for the better after watching this highly acclaimed show on netflix. It discusses the first law of thermodynamics, aka transmutation etc. They use language that is alien \ud83d\udc7d but understandable by modern laws of physics you see. When they cross over into the spiritual realm, is when the show gets really deep. The questions of what is spiritual, start to develop with the Elric Boys. The two brothers lost a mother and the older tries to bring her back this killing his brother but saving his soul inside of a giant metallic robot. I know, it's a bit crazy, but it all comes together nicely. Enjoy, and tell me what you think of the endearing and everlasting dynamic show! Murf",
        "Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.Such was what I discovered when I first laid my eyes on the original FMA series. And yet, for all it's greatness, it began to flounder in it's second season. As many series do, it took on its own form and story, and it was at that point that it started to lose its charm. So, Bones did the smart thing. They remade it. For most series, this would be pointless, but for FMA, it's very much welcome. Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.It's hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren't subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details. These are what make the new FMA an instant new-age classic. Like FMA was the first time around, the new FMA will be one of the top anime to watch out for in the states."

    "Baccano!": [
        "When I started watching this series I didn't know much about it but as it could be watched legally on Funimation's YouTube channel I thought I'd give it a go; I'm glad I did as it is one of the best anime series that I've seen. It is only sixteen episodes long but there isn't a moment wasted as it is jam packed with story and a large cast of memorable characters. When the cast it is first introduced in the opening credits it seems that it will be impossible to remember who is who but as they are such great characters it isn't so difficult. The great names also help; who could forget characters with names like Jacuzzi Splot, Czeslaw Meyer and Szilard Quates. The characters are a mix of immortals, gangsters and psychopaths living in 1930's America. Over the course of the series we learn how they became immortal, how they get to know each other and most importantly what happened aboard the 'Flying Pussyfoot' a transcontinental express bound for New York on board which most of the cast meet and many people die in unpleasant circumstances. Much of the series take place on the train but we also see frequent flash forwards of what happened before and what happens later, amazingly this does not lead to confusion.The series was a lot of fun but also included violent scenes which would make it unsuitable for younger viewers; the actions of 'Rail Tracer' might give them nightmares, they made me cringe and its a long time since I was a child. The animation looks fantastic, the slight sepia tint giving it a period look and distinctive characters made it a joy to watch, it also had a great musical score to accompany it.These comments are made based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles although I did see one of the episodes in English and thought the dub was pretty good.",
        "Despite having the best English dub voice actors, it's setting era and its likeable characters, it just didn't click with me as being the best anime to watch. I mean I have watched just 3 episodes but I just didn't get into the mood of wanting to watch it more...Sorry to fans of the anime but its just not one of my best anime lists.....",
        "The people we pass by everyday all have stories, it's always the choices people make that either make the stories or even throw themselves into intentionally or unintentionally, design by fate or chance by choice, either way makes each characters story more broader because other people with stories intersect and connect. This is a principle in the mysterious art of storytelling but also life itself.This is one of my personal favorite animes, I can't say too much about this anime since discovering things for yourself is actually one of the best things about this show. This show has so much going for it it truly will require more than one watch because it's just one of those stories where you uncover more as you revisit it making it long lasting. The animation is great the background animation is probably the most impressive to me cause it both captures decades long gone but also it's not static it's actually lively.The story telling format is similar to films like \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Watchman\" and \"Memento\", which tell their stories in a non-linear format. I always loved this format in storytelling because it adds a great amount of intrigue and depth to both story and characters and makes you constantly wanting more info about their lives. There are lots of characters in this show it's confusing at first but if you stick with this show for a while you'll know who is who, how their connected and actually care about them. My favorites are Isaac and Mira whom are both eccentric airheads but their hearts are always in the right place and they do take actions that do have fruitful results.The show is literally a puzzle another reason why it requires more than one watch. By it's nature the story is really simple it just doesn't seem that way due to it's jumbled arrangement and the fact there is so much happening and information, just when you think you have it all figured out think again because there is another twist that can throw you perception off balance. It's also beautiful mix of genres,there is alchemy, action, romance, gangster crime, noir, martial arts, slasher horror, comedy, fantasy, it's an exhausting mix but it all blends in perfectly like throwing in different fruits to make a tasty fruit punch.As an old saying goes, \"Everything happens for a reason.\" Rating: 4 stars",
        "Review By Kamal KEvery so often an anime comes along that isn't afraid to challenge the conventions by which a story is told. Too often, despite being noteworthy or groundbreaking, these shows can fail due to poor animation, lackluster characters, or a marked failure in plot development. In other words, they get so caught up in being unconventional that they sacrifice the other, more important aspects.Thankfully, Baccano! is not one of those.AnimationBaccano! maintains a very high standard of animation throughout its entirety. Brains Base made good use of color to heighten the effect of the more dramatic moments in the show. Especially during the action sequences, is a credit to their effort and skill.SoundBaccano! opens with the excellent (and very appropriate for the setting) track Guns N Roses quot by Paradise Lunch. The jazzy theme of the OP fits perfectly against the backdrop of 1930's America, in which the majority of the show is set. This jazz themed music continues throughout the entirety of the show and adds a certain authentic flavor which is often lacking in other shows. The only true downside to the music is the ED, which is a stereotypical J-ballad. However, this is only a small detraction from the otherwise great music though and can easily be skipped over.Another area where Baccano! excelled was the voice acting. The talented VAs for each role managed to breathe life and individuality into the large and diverse cast of characters. The most singular achievement of the voice actors is that each of the characters can be easily identified by voice alone, as each actor has brought a different timbre, a different nuance, sometimes even a different accent, to each role.CharactersFrom the marvelously hilarious Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent to the psychopathic Ladd Russo, all the characters are very well designed and as unique as their voices. Isaac and Miria are without doubt the most memorable members of an excellent cast of characters. The duo effectively serve as a glue that holds the story together. They dance through the series's multiple time lines like a giddy gyroscope on acid, occasionally colliding with one of the other cast members at random (usually by fluke).StoryThe story in Baccano! is very straightforward. Usually, it is the style of in which the story is told that receives the most attention. Baccano! adopts a non-sequential storytelling style. While this may not be anything new (the TV broadcast of Haruhi and the movie Pulp Fiction did the same thing), Baccano! has multiple individual storylines, all of which intertwine into a larger story. At first, the events and characters may be confusing. But once you're past the initial surprise of leaping feet first into the middle of the story, you find yourself immersed in an unusual, fast-paced and entertaining style of storytelling that whets your appetite for more.OverallBaccano! contains a nice mixture of drama, action and comedy. This, coupled with some amazing characters and a good short story, makes Baccano! one of the most enjoyable romps in recent years. The absurd, comedic moments serve as a perfect counterweight to the action and tension that builds throughout the show. Nothing is too dramatic or depressing, and both the humor and the violence aren't forced. The most enjoyable thing about Baccano! is that each character's actions feel natural to that character and this comes across to the viewer in a big way.Baccano! is one of the rarest types of anime as it successfully merges comedy, suspense, action and even a little romance, without sacrificing animation or sound quality. It is a gem that will appeal to fans of many different genres and it is one of the few animes that can be watched again and again without suffering any loss of enjoyment.",
        "Its a Great watch for such a short series having only 16 episodes. Has its share of suspense,action and laughter The first two episodes were a task to watch as you didn't know whats happening with the overload of characters,the many time jumps and the confusing story.By the time the third episode ended, i was hooked. The sheer brilliance of the story line became clear. You will fall in love with the characters who are all unique. This animation is unique in having no central character. Each have there own story to tell and all of them are intriguing.Each episode leaves you with wanting to know what will happen next.The music is also great. Sad it ended so soon, do want to have more of these guys",
        "Reciewed: 2011Animation was great, art was wonderful, soundtrack was nostalgic, story was great, narrative was truly phenomenal, characters were really great, and it was very original.I don't think I've ever seen a supernatural story that takes place during the prohibition, and I love it. The best quality of this anime is by far the narrative; the characters were perfect, the voice acting was exemplary, and the character development combined with the anachronism was spectacular. This anime has earned the closest rating to perfection that I've ever given and currently holds the title of both the best anime I've ever seen and of my favorite anime. Truly incredible.",
        "This show is incredible - and it's only 13 episodes. If you're like me, and you prefer anime shows with a bit more of a mainstream, perhaps even \"Westernized\" flavor, this is a great choice. The only irritating cutesiness comes from the slapstick duo of Isaac and Miria, a pair of dopey criminals; everything else is brilliantly scripted and slickly animated.The ridiculously complex plot spans several time periods and involves an enormous cast of characters, all seamlessly intersecting in fascinating ways. Everyone, from the homicidal gangster Ladd Russo to the cocky mafiosi Firo Prochainezo, to the blood-caked assassin Clare Stanfield, receive their share of great scenes. The show is tender, surprising, violent, funny, and always compelling. The editing is some of the best I've seen in an anime, with the subplots bouncing off of each other through different time periods - 1930s Prohibition-era New York, to the 1700s, to the present day. No Japanese aesthetics here, outside of the obvious fact that it's a Japanese cartoon; characters and settings are all clearly influenced by European and American culture.The action sequences are brutal and fluid, with plenty of great fights throughout. Lots of foul language in the English dub, which suits the show's style. As Anime News Network similarly pointed out, the English dub here is preferable just because of how well the voice cast pulls off all the different accents the characters have. Some characters are French, some are working-class \"New Yohkahs\" and still others are bourgeoise. One of the best English dubs you're likely to ever hear, I'd say.There is a supernatural element to the show, but it's wonderfully subtle: some characters are immortals, growing back appendages and digits in wonderfully animated sequences that show every drop of blood coagulating and returning to the flesh from whence they came - almost like a slow-motion vacuum. The ways in which characters can become immortal function as one of the great wrinkles of the show, and there's even a unique way for immortals to kill each other known as \"devouring\"; saying anymore would be spoiling the fun. Needless to say, the desire to be immortal (or the desire to die) propels lots of the different factions in the show to clash with one another (often unintentionally).As a feat of multi-pronged, centuries-spanning, character-heavy writing, this is undeniably an anime epic for the ages. I've never seen ANYTHING like it, and I doubt I ever will again. The only flaw is the ending, which feels a bit abrupt - like there should be more (I know the light novel series upon which the show is based did continue after the events of the show). One of my favorite anime shows ever, one that I often think about, and one that I rewatch at least once a year. Near perfection.",
        "This anime was a lot of things but it is surprisingly good. The flow of it doesn't start until episode 10 when things started to really fall in to place plot wise. Though I could see at the end where the constant jumping from scene to scene was for enjoyable than confusing. Honestly its because of that that it lost a full 10/10 rating from me. The characters are actually really easy to like and some are just so weirdly violent you can;t wait to see what horrible thing they will do next. Though the over dramatic performances just add to the hilarity of it. Which honestly really does help balance out the actual horrible things that they are doing.Overall this was a good anime. Confusing, weird, horrible but good.",
        "A multi-strand tale of mobsters and alchemy, 'Baccano' is the 16 episode story of a colourful cast of characters on the other side of the law (including hit men, gangsters, socialites, robbers and well, an alchemist or two) whose lives change over the course of three years (1931-1933) as they deal with the likes of a turf war, gangland murders, an elaborate train heist and the convergence of 'immortals' seeking the means to produce an elixir of eternal life. And that's just a quick skim! A fun and distinct period romp, 'Baccano' is told in a manner akin to 'Rashomon': jumping between different characters and times and seeing their effects on the story, and given our diverse cast, this equals a lot of possibilities. The train is the main anchoring point, and where most of the story takes place, but we cut back to prior years to help inform characters, as well as the bigger narrative of the show, which deals with immortals, alchemy and their ongoing battle. Despite all this though, the show is for the most part a drama with comedic elements (mainly in the form of cosplaying thieves Issac and Miria), and not a big whizzbang fantasy or action show. In fact, this would make a great beginner's anime, given how restrained it actually is and not using a lot of the 'eccentricities' that the form has become notorious for. If the West produced mature dramatic animated series, this is how I imagine it would look.Animation is solid, sleek and dynamic without being hyperactive, the voice work is good despite some accents, and the 30s setting allows for some really neat recreations of the contradiction that was 30s America: really gorgeous skyscrapers and trains versus very dingy warehouses, dark speakeasys and slummy neighbourhoods. The large group of characters are also by and large rather likable and fun, even if they are slightly stock mafia archetypes, with special note going to the aforementioned Issac and Miria. They are such wonderfully charismatic and energetic goofballs yet not so much so they clash with the darker elements.As far as complaints, I really can't offer much, except that having a big cast does mean some of them, as well as certain plot threads, are not fully tied up by the end, yet their introductions make them feel more important than they actually turn out to be. Plus, the returning immortals angle is not explored as much as you would think, with really only one episode being the focus and then a quick cap off at the end. I wish they did delve a little more into their lives and what the effects of living so long do to different people. However, the rest of the show is so engaging that it didn't become too big an issue.In the end, 'Bacanno' was a neat little surprise. It's not 'FullMetal Godfather' as one may be lead to think at first, but it's an exciting and often lively romp through the unlikely blend of mob and magic. Not sure about anime because of all the fanservice, kawaii and ADD action? Give this a shot ya mug.",
        "How to explain this anime... I think the best way to describe this show is if you took a book and ripped out all the pages, put them in random order and then read the jumbled pages as a book lol. This show makes almost no cents until around episode 7, then it starts to pick up in stuff making cents and action wise and becomes easier to follow. If you don't watch the series from beginning to end i can almost guarantee you wont really like it, but if you watch it all the way through it basically explains everything, just all out of order. With all that being said its a decent show, the characters are all crazy in a good way and make you like them. Honestly i could take it or leave it, but having stuck with it to the end i did like it more then if i stopped half way.Overall 3.5-4/5 I wasn't a big fan of the way they portrayed the show, in my opinion it could have been done a lot smoother but that being said it was done the way it was for a reason. But even so its just not that appealing to the watcher its kind of annoying trying to figure out what the hell is going on or who were talking about cause it changes so often. You do get use to it and once things get explained a little more in depth it gets more enjoyable.",
        "The variety of characters and the time jumps seemed like a good idea for storytelling at the beginning but after a point it got a little annoying. The conversation at the beginning and the end of series is definitely an interesting way to communicate the authors intentions and address the fourth wall.They didn't focus even a little bit on the loneliness side of immortality which could have been explored. They kept plenty of leads open for a sequel but I guess there isn't supposed to be one.",
        "The first time I saw the title sequence cured me of all hype aversion I had for this, and I was hooked on the series. Watching and hearing the opening credits still never gets old for me.It's hard to describe without spoilers, so I'll be brief. Unforgettable characters. Brilliant dialog. Gripping action scenes. Intelligent premises, with a little bit of the fantastic but not enough to feel inauthentic in the 30's prohibition underworld setting.At first it's difficult to follow because of the anachronistic order and sheer loads of characters, but as you get used to the pacing and familiar with the faces, the pieces begin to fit together. The storytelling is genius, and the reveals are a lot more rewarding exposed in this way than if time were shown sequentially.English dub: I just finished watching this, and it's a fair localization that kept to the spirit of the original, and included more appropriate accents. It's somewhat lacking in that Isaac and Miria, two of the more watchable characters, just aren't as funny, though the actors are decent they don't have the same chemistry as the original Japanese.",

There is Mafias, Alchemists, Thieves, Thugs, And a monster Rail Tracer who is killing Everybody abroad the transcontinental train Flying Pussyfoot. For the out-of-order sequences and too many Characters, It will be Hard to many viewers at First, but after some Episodes It will be clear and If you see Total 16 episodes, you will get the Real fun and understand many things from Earlier.*It mainly Follows Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent - two Very Stupid Thieves, Luck Gandor - Youngest brother of the Mafia Gandor Family, Maiza Avaro and Firo Prochainezo - Bookkeeper and Youngest member of the Martillo Camorra Family respectively, Eve Genoard - a Member of Wealthy Genoard Family, Szilard Quates - an Alchemist, Ennis - a Homunculus created by Szilard, Czeslaw Meyer Mysterious young boy, Jacuzzi Splot - an Extremly Shy and Polite gang leader and Nice Holystone - a Explosive expert and Childhood friend of Jacuzzi. Chane Leforet - A mute knife Fighter, Ladd Russo - a Sadistic Hitman for the Russo Mafia family and The Rail Tracer, you will get to know What is rail tracer, after watching the series. There are many more characters, I just named a Few Memorable ones..*The Soundtrack is Great. Background Music is Great. The Opening \"Guns and Roses\" with the Character Introduction is One of the Coolest anime Opening ever. This sort of Opening was used in the Guy Ritchie Movie \"Snatch\", That movie is also Great and could be a Inspiration for this.*It's one of my Most Favorite Anime series but I don't really Suggest this Anime to many people because It is not everyone's Cup of tea. As It is Hard to keep up with All the Characters and Plot, and many people don't see it Or left it after seeing some episode. But If you are Interested Enough, then Watch the Full anime, you will not Regret it. It's also Another Case of More Cooler in Dub anime series, So watch it in English Dub.",
        "This is one of the greatest masterpiece of an anime that no one seems to care about, please just go and watch it it's just 13 episode and it's just quality entertainment through out, thanks me later",
        "I first watched this one on the funimation website. They were having this special thing where you could watch the first episode online for free! (was in Japanese tho', which was peculiar instead of the dub:0) Aaaaanyway, this show is addictive and quite enjoyable. I could tell you about THE main character..but there are MANY main characters. The show keeps hopping along from character to character, describing certain events from different perspectives(did that make any sense??). This series is rather confusing so far, but I'm hoping it'll make more sense once I watch more of it. I've only seen the first four eps. The series is set in the 1930s in the U.S., which is pretty different for those used to watching anime where the setting is almost always Japan. There's some slang from the 1930s too, weird to get used to(plus some characters have accents). The dub is exceptional btw. Japanese is pretty good as well. Recommend either one.So far, I give this show a 9/10. The music is great(the theme is pretty much intrumental 1930s music.), the animation is great(much like the style from Blood Plus),the voice acting is very spot-on, and the story is great. This is a great show,but should be noted it is rated M for mature, so maybe not such a great idea to let your little 5 year old watch it..they might be a little traumatized from the blood in some scenes. So far, there hasn't been that much blood tho', so don't let that stop you from watching the show:) Hope you watch! The first DVD is out now and more are on the way^^",
        "By far one of the most unique anime I've yet to see. The story is hard to follow at first and some may find the initial amount of characters overwhelming. But its hardly a problem once the show establishes itself. Its easily one of the greatest 1 part anime out there and very underrated in this community. My only warning is to read lightly if you are sensitive to gore.",
        "I don't recommend this anime. I saw 8 episodes and stopped watching it. I found the story and the characters dull and not at all engaging. It has nothing to do with the complexity of the plot, the number of characters or the twisted way of telling the story. It's just I had no fun watching the show and I had to keep forcing myself to watch one episode after another.",
        "1. First Thing first - \"best editing in any anime series ever.\" Perfect pace.. not to slow,, a bit fast, but you wont be totally clueless Grabs your interest thought out the entire 16 episodes.. 2. Good Story \"represented in the most amazing way\". Actual plot is not the best thing but still awesome. You have to watch the entire series to get a complete understanding and after completing you will relish it even more and might get a complete new understanding to the story. **Brilliant Inner Meaning**3. \"Great Character Depth.\" Every character is special, different and grabs your attention (there are a lot of characters.. a lot)4. I love the music.. opening track is energetic ,, ending is melancholic Background music build up at the perfect scenes.5. Animation is old school,, Brilliant|| Now, when I say the best anime its not mind blowing story/ thriller/ mystery/ science fiction / like Death Note/ Code Geass/ Samurai Champloo/ Steins Gate/ like super popular's like OP/ Naruto... but the overall experience is unlike any other (Guaranteed) ||**Be warned.. lot of violence Watch yourself and recommend to others**",
        "This was one the best series I have seen, not just in anime but altogether. SUCH interesting characters,and the main characters Isaac and Miria are a bunch of lovable idiots. I almost fell laughing,they were hilarious. The animation is great,go watch it. The voice acting is just awesome,not just random dubbing,its great. So,it starts of in 1700s as a group of alchemists are granted an elixir of immortality by the frigging Devil himself. The now immortal group unanimously decides to keep this a secret and destroy the elixir; but one of them ,Slizard Quates opposes. Many years later again till 1930 the story is continued in Manhattan, and the chaos begins. The story is told in intervals of different time periods. Just watch till the last episode. There is a lot of blood,gore and violence. Its has elements of dark satirical comedy. A unique and great watch!",
        "I've just concluded watching this anime for the third time, and I have to say you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching it. I was terribly shocked by its score on IMDb. 7.9? Blasphemy. There are only two logical reasons for anyone to not like this show. 1. they are appalled by blood. 2. they are not willing to think. The plot of this show requires you to use your head and give your undivided attention. But this is a strength of the show. It will completely immerse you and is totally filler free. Three times through, and not a second of this show bores me. Three story lines are expertly weaved together with pacing that reveals everything at just the right time. The characters are amazingly fun to watch bounce of each other. Insane people are set up, and the pay-off is amazing when they meet up. The animation makes this even better. The show is the perfect length, so the budget is spread out to where everything is fluid and all the characters expressions are captured excellently. The music is the exact same way, and the opening is the best I've ever seen, ever. The voice acting is superb. Funimation's best dub to date. It captures the time excellently and every actor/actress is giving there all. It's a show near perfection. The one flaw it has is some of the confusion there might be on first watching. But in the end everything is rapped up and is fully satisfying. Which is why I would give it a 9.7. I've seen 30 anime and this is number two, only being topped by Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I've also watched many respected youtube reviewers such as GRArkada, Gigguk, and JesuOtaku. Every single one either gave the show a perfect 10 or a strong 9. It's not just for anime fans. I showed this to my 40 year old parents (never seen anime) and they loved it. Do yourself a favor, go out and buy Baccano right now. Not afraid of blood or focus? Then you will have a hell of a time.",
        "Now, I am a die-hard fan of the popular anime, such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Fairy Tail, Attack on Titan, One Piece, etc. However, this is by far my favorite anime of all time. Consisting of only 16 episodes, that's all this shows needs. It accomplishes in such a short time what other shows often need hundreds of episodes to complete. The storyline is so intriguing and perfectly done that I can't even imagine anything being changed. You would think with such a short time, that you would have under developed characters and a flat storyline, right? WRONG! All of the characters are developed to their fullest, growing attachment to even those that are ruthless killers (*cough* Ladd Russo *cough*). The story is told out of order, but this just makes it even more interesting as the more you watch, the more pieces fall into place in the carefully interwoven plot. The musical score is amazing, the dub is fantastically casted, matching (and maybe even surpassing) the skill of the sub, it's full of everything you could ever want. Thieves, immortals, alchemists, mafia, dark humor, light humor, gore (gallons of it), and so much more. Give this show a shot. It is too underrated, and it deserves so much more attention for the amazing job that was done. No matter what you're a fan of, you can find it in this show.",
        "there are many areas in which this anime deserves a 10/10. it has many, many characters that, although initially seem to overload you with information, will each form a connection with you by the time the 16 episodes are up. this anime spares nothing when it comes to showing bloody fights and the like. however, it is used tastefully and is not to be confused with shows that have nothing but unchoreographed fight scenes, using chopped limbs and blood only to satisfy those who get off on that type of thing. \"baccano!\" takes a while to grow but if you stick it out till the end you will be very glad you did, for anyone who watches the entire series will be left with a longing for more anime like this one. i give this anime a 10/10 not because i have some connection with it or die hard obsession with it. i give it that because that is the rating anyone who watches it should give it, simply because it is closer to a 10 than it is to a 9.\"Baccano!\" is close to being a one of a kind masterpiece. the only reason it does not achieve that title is do to \"Durarara!\", another great anime by the same production company, Brain Base, which i highly recommend seeing. \"baccano!\" consists of 13 episodes with 3 extra episodes that were released with the DVD.",
        "There are shows with a lot of suspense, blood and gore with no humour whatsoever, being completely serious, and have to be very long to get the story complete. This is not that show. This show has its share of suspense, blood and gore, but what it also has, is an amazing story concisely told in 16 episodes. In the beginning, I was questioning as to where this story was going, but as the story progressed, I felt like I was been taken as a spectator on a journey with these interesting characters. All I can say is that the writer has been on point with the way this story has been told, and it has been executed perfectly by the animators. This is my 2nd viewing of this show, and I am able to piece things which I missed out from my first viewing without a dull moment since the pace of this show is so interesting. Kudos!",
        "From start to end, this is one the greatest animes ever.\nIt weaves multiple stories together in just 16 episodes and gives a really satisfying conclusion.\nIt gets better and better the more times you watch it.",
        "Its is one of the best I have seen and trust me I have seen over 50 different animes. Its so creative how they switch stories. It may be hard for some people but its cool to see the different POV (point of view). Its amazing to see how the characters go so well with the story. I was sad to see that there was a low rating but I mean it has alot of gore and blood and not everyone can handle that. The anime is always moving and I can never get enough. Its like it brings you in. In my opinion it was hard to stop watching. This anime is in the 1930 and it has alot of mafias which is my cup of tea but not everyone's. It is really creative and well thought out. If you like this you will most likely like 91 days one of my favorites as well as this one."

        "What does it mean to be strong? How do you know when you are strong? Hajime No Ippo is a wonderful sports shonen anime comparable to Slam Dunk. It has the vibes, development, and technicality that seperates it from most sport/shonen animes.The story is pretty good though not perfect. It has light immature comedy, and a tiny bit of romance. The directing knew how to main proper atmosphere and tone in different backgrounds such as in the boxing ring. There is seriously nothing that is flawed or something particularly bad about this anime, it a well rounded anime. The pacing is great though a tad bit inconsistent especially during matches. When you are feeling down this anime is a definite go to to bring your mood up. Most of the matches were really good, full of action and dialogue but was predictable at times. And what happpens outside the ring is just as great. Mostly focues on Ippo but some on Miyata and the group as a whole and the opponents. And themes about family and commitment, the whole story felt like a motivational video.Ippo is the main character in this anime. Ippo's perserveance and strength are two of Ippo's most unique traits. No matter how many times you hit him he will get back right up. He is considered wimpy/weird by many of his peers and gets bullied occasionally. But one day he found his destiny(boxing) with the help of a certain person. He simply asks himself\"What does it mean to be strong?\". He is truly a kind hearted person and is humble and doesn't take things too personally and his development is great. Even though Takamura might seem like a bad person from the outside deep down he a good person. The enemies have their own origins and story. The supporting characters are pretty good some such as Aoki and Kimura serving as comic reliefs while others as detailed characters such as Kamogawa and Sendo and Miyata that have their own story. Overall a wide variety of characters that are solid for the most part.Even though Ippo is like 20 years the animation is smooth with pretty good shading and the character designs are great, the only problem with the visuals is the clarity and sharpenss of the world. Ex. If they do a long shot for the camera everything seems a bit undetailed and you can't tell how the character's face looks like and etc. The close ups for the camera were great. You could tell when the boxer was in pain and what his emotion was like and you could see how poweful the punches were up close. And lastly it had hilarious icongraphy when the characters would be in awkward/funny dialogues.The music is great and was really enchanting. Especially the electric guitar symphony which is great. The use of the violin, guitar, drums, trumpet, and paino it made such a difference in the tone and atmosphere of the story. The songs they used were pretty good also. Though there are no intro and outros. Very diverse set of instruments but mostly consisted of electronic music.Overall a very enjoyable anime. The second anime I watched after AOT and ranks as one of my top 3 favorite animes of all time. After watching this show I can't stop myself doing jabs every once in a while. Though in my opnion it's not bingey worthy and requires some patience from the viewer every once in a while cuz it might be a bit dull or repetetive at times though near the end it does get better.Memorable: YES Rewatchable: Yes.",
        "This is like Mike Tysons Punchout on the NES. Every fighter has some sort of signature and the entire show is about boxers figuring out how to use their moves or counter others. Its fun but it has flaws.For one thing, it becomes insanely predictable. Good guys over come by sheer will power pretty much every time. Though everyone loves a good Rocky story, you can do it so many times. This is an anime and there are tons of fights so as you can imagine, it really just gets worse over time for this reason.The other problem is I dont like most of the characters and challengers are almost always hallow. Even long spanning characters arent particularly likeable. They mostly act like teenagers at the gym. Takamura is by far the worst of the group. Absolutely hate his character. No redeeming qualities of any kind. At least the main protagonist is likeable so thats a plus.Last I dont like some of the messages. Some are plain lousy. For example we had a fight where they glorify taking advantages of opponent weaknesses. Basically win at any cost. This isnt sportsmanship and this is not what I teach my kids. Its means you are just in it for fame or money and not for the sport which is literally the entire reason its called a \"sport.\"Also the author seems to dislike anyone not Japanese (lol). They all have major psychological problems. Hell the world champs come off as total weak dopes or a-holes especially the Americans. Some of the tropes are absolutely hilarious. I dont think the author means any harm but yea they are there. Kind of like how Rocky treats Drago. Obviously Russians arent that way nor are Americans how they are portrayed here.",
        "Will forever be my favorite animeOr as Ali would say: \"The Greatest of ALL TIME!!!\"Must-see for any boxing fan, sports fan, love the art of fighting, the strategies that go behind competitive boxing (or fighting in general)\n--------A humble kid who helps his mom at her shop and gets picked on after-school ; after seeing him in action, the kid idolizes the neighborhood boxing champ and the big guy recruits him to join the gym ...

        "After watching rocky Balboa I liked boxing. Man this anime is something. Anime is the best. It's very motivating and exciting. Man there are scene which I wanted to see more n more like the dancy roll something that was something to watch.",
        "It is a gripping story, the characters are great. But for boxing fans the exaggeration is annoying.It is too slow-paced, which is a problem because boxing is fast. Real boxing is more about reflex than chess like tactics.On the plus side, if someone is willing to invest the time, beginners can indeed learn fundamentals of boxing.Also, the protagonist, Ippo is annoying. It is more than compensated by the brilliance of other characters, but still.",
        "Pros:\nDecent story\nNice backgrounds for characters\nSome character growth\nAnimation is really nice\nEasy to relate to the charactersMeh:\nFights are somewhat predictable.I really liked this anime because it had a decent story with nice animations. I am not a sports fan, so the story just wasn't for me, and i ended up dropping the series after about 12 episodes. Nonetheless, i felt i had to remark on its quality. The characters are likeable, the fights are fast paced, and you almost being to feel for the characters being punched. The animations really do communicate well, and is worth watching an episode or two just for that.If you are not a sports fan, it's less likely that you will enjoy the story. Then again, there is a lot to relate to. I only dropped it because boxing rubs me the wrong way, and even then, i just had to watch a good few episodes first. So, from me, i have mixed feelings about the anime. But if you're looking for a decent story, you might just find it here.",
        "This is just awesome. I am thoroughly disappointed with myself for not watching this sooner and feel sad that, a masterpiece like this is underrated.I have never been a fan of a sport other than cricket, but this show has made me a Boxing fan.What I enjoyed the most about this is, unlike most shounen anime, where there are sudden power ups making the characters stronger, this one shows real development of the character in terms of strength, determination through intense training and constant hustle.Each and every character in this show is likeable because of their unique ways of fighting and for their unique beliefs about fighting.The icing on the cake here is the wonderful soundtrack and BGM which makes the show when more captivating and interesting.I would highly recommend this show because it has everything, action, drama, comedy, rivalry, camaraderie (little bit of love also..)\n75 episodes of sheer power, motivation and friendship. Truly the most inspiring anime I have ever watched.",
        "The entire anime is good, regardless of season, but it has one major flaw- bias; the writer/creator of this is (obviously) bitter over Japan's loss against the USA in WW2 times and the series reflects that near perfectly. In reality, an American boxer will easily beat any Japanese boxer without question as opposed to what's displayed in the anime.",
        "Where do I begin? I have seen the first season twice already and its still stupendous. Within the anime sports genre, this one takes the biscuit. Admittedly, I have not seen many sports anime and have missed out on some anime such as Slam Dunk and Prince of Tennis but I can assure you, based on my judgement and combining this with other people's opinions ( it is a very popular anime and widely discussed), this anime transcends the competitors. However, I have seen sports anime such as Cross Game (baseball) and Kurko no Basket (basketball). The latter is current and much talked about in the anime World. Regardless, Hajime no Ippo has greater characters, more technical insight and more credible sporting feats than Kuroko no Basket. Cross Game was a work of art and is the only sports type anime that comes close to this beauty.So why is this anime so great and deserves my praise and on top of that 10/10? The answer is somewhat complex but bare with me. Firstly,all great sports anime should sell the sport it represents and make it somewhat appealing even to somebody who has not invested much interest into the sport. I was not into boxing but after watching Hajime no Ippo, I felt energised and ready for action. I threw jabs in the air and was shadow-boxing. On top of that,this anime taught me about the rules of boxing and provided me with some technical knowledge. Bravo to this anime for getting me hooked on something I never previously considered.Furthermore, the boxing matches in this anime always bring novelty to the table and are mostly technically sound. The mangaka (manga artist) is a passionate boxing fan and does rigorous research about boxing and bases some of his characters on real life boxers such as Mike Tyson. Real life technical ( not basic) boxing techniques are also mentioned and shown.Secondly, a great anime should have elements to it that go beyond its main genre to keep other niche audiences satisfied. This anime has great comedy. Kamogawa gym members, Aoki, Kimura and Takamura bring so much life and humour to this incredible action packed show. The interaction of Takamura and Aoki is beyond funny. It is the execution of these extra elements that separates the great from the mediocre. Thirdly, a great anime, in particular a masterpiece, should have MANY characters that are well developed, have great depth and add an extra dimension to the anime. After all, what is the point in watching anime with great visuals, sound tracks etc when there is poor dialogue or plain, predictable and annoying characters. Anime that lack great characters do not stimulate the brain. This anime nails it. The protagonist Ippo is naive and not blessed with genius fighting skills. Regardless, he learns from his peers and through perseverance, his indomitable fighting spirit and unwavering concentration, is able to progress as a boxer and more importantly a human being. This anime has many great boxers and great dialogue. Eiji Datte's reference to Ippo's \"light\" fists, Takamura's great boxing advice and feats as well as Ippo's venerable coach's perspicacious boxing advice, are some of the elements this anime presents, that inspire and guide Ippo. The great dialogues and character interactions allow Ippo to mature and blossom into the wonderful boxer he is to become.I am going to stop with the numbering now. In short, a great anime, not just a sports anime, should have: characters with depth; interesting dialogue; good voice actors; fun and/or intricate plot; good art style; extra elements such as comedy and so forth. The only criticism that I can immediately think of about this anime is the slightly dated art style. It is an old anime and therefore lacks the visual clarity and definition. However, some episodes such as episode 74 have so much detail and perfection, despite the dated animation screen quality, that one still gets totally drawn in and absorbed by the unfolding high level brawl that is presented.Episode 74's dialogue, pacing, music, fighting choreography etc is otherworldly. Given that there are 76 episodes in the first season, this anime ends on a positive note and packs a punch. The other episodes are vital for character development and are also incredibly fun to watch. The boxing is captivating. The training and normal life of Ippo and the others are also refreshing and makes us hunger for the next big fight. Having seen many renown anime I can safely say that this anime deserves to be ranked with the best and deserves the praise and attention it has and is been receiving. On top of all this, this anime has great soundtracks and offers above average opening songs/credits. There is not much more one can ask for. It was an exhilarating watch. Please give this anime a go. For an anime lover, it should be a must. Oh and by the way, watch this, and any anime, with your native subtitles whenever possible (avoid dubbed versions). I find English dubbing horrendous. Japan's voice artists are usually on point and are PROPERLY trained in the arts of speaking. The voice intonation in Japanese suits the characters and is more natural.",
        "Hajime no ippo is one of the best anime that I have watched , it deserve your time even if you hate boxing you have to watch it",
        "Hajime no ippo is about a guy named (ippo) who goes from being bullied by his classmates to become one of the best fighters in the world. The best thing about this show is that this doesn't only revolve around boxing but also shows you the hardships along the way while purusing a dream and shows the obstacles that we face in doing that and how to overcome it. It's a perfect blend of sports and comedy. This is totally worth watching\nOST'S are really good.Arigato:)",
        "I've seen this series as Hajime no ippo(in India) in Japanese language. If you love martial arts and anime then you'll totally love this series, more over this series has explained the minutest boxing techniques in most detailed manner. I've been a student in a boxing club in teenage and this anime was an opportunity to remove the nostalgia of those days. Dempsy roll, twisting shoulder to generate extra reach & power, playing as a south paw player, everything is taught to a boxer.The fear of heavyweight senior Takamura san is funny but real too. All clubs/arenas have this one senior who is experienced, powerful and cocky \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01. Also the journey of Ippo from a rookie to his weight category champion is beautifully shown in this series. About how a boxer feels, how his mind works, how his body reacts inside the ring, everything is beautifully shown in this series.Conclusion - a must watch if you love sports anime.",
        "Best series ever how is redacted i have gotten really into it you should give it a chance, I'll give it 10/10 for an anime series.",
        "I don't usually like anime but this is another level. If someone tried to make a parody video of what a boxing anime would look like, they wouldn't even come close to this whateverthisis. Each episode is just exposition and more exposition and a little more exposition, followed by a lot more exposition. It has no character development, and nothing happens at all, ever. I regret the time I invested watching it (the few episodes I did watch) and I want it back. Probably one of those things that should have remained a manga.",
        "This anime is truly great from plot to background osts , everything is good..its like the artist has put his own soul into this..there are not many shows which gave as thrill as this.At first I thought it would be like any other sports Anime where it is all about sports..but eventually it proved me wrong as I went on watching where they show how hard it is to be a boxer where you earn very little money for getting beaten so badly..it focuses on the reality of how boxers lives ..this anime deserves to be the best sports Anime...at least to me I was glad that I got to watch this sports masterpiece..no one would regret watching it!!",
        "At first, i didn't like ANIME at all, i thought it's just for child's, but when i saw 3 first episodes of this \"hajime no ippo\" i knew this is the right ANIME *serie?* for me. I just simply loved it, how he trained himself + the hilarious humor the funny faces and beating up his opponents, effects were world class and when i for first time saw the famous \"dempsey roll\", no kidding: my hair was all electronic & stuff, we talked about this on school, with friends & stuff, if you like boxing: you will love this one! it's the best Anime i've ever seen, no kidding, beating up enemies + humor = PERFECT10 out of 10 !",
        "First let me start by saying that I'm lucky to have had the honour of witnessing the thrilling roller-coaster that is Hajime No Ippo, and I am fairly certain that a lot of individuals would agree with me if they decide to give this anime a fair shot. I am writing this review to express what I think of this anime in general and why I think a lot of people would enjoy it as wellHajime no Ippo exists not only to thrill but arguably excite viewer to the point of no return by bringing blow after blow of jaw-dropping twists in a narrative that feels as furious as a dog fight, it is the sports anime that challenges all others of its kind to do better. Essentially the coming-of-age tale of a weakling maturing into the strongest rookie boxer in Japan, Hajime no Ippo doesn't deviate from the sports anime formula in any notable manner. Ippo discovers boxing on a school day like any other then spends numerous staged fights and training montages thereafter rising through the ranks. However, the show outshines all lesser versions thanks to its exceptional script. Simply put, it boasts a bottomless supply of twists to make every fight feel as though it were the first. That Ippo has to win his battles despite his great weaknesses is no spoiler; nonetheless the developments during the fights - their sheer visceral power - obliterate all expectations. Whenever I thought the show had exhausted its store of excitement in one episode, it delivered new unscaled heights of the stuff in the next. Aside from that, Hajime no Ippo shows that even neanderthals know how to laugh and cry through healthy doses of comedy and character development. Between the hilariously inane penis jokes and the heart-rending personal struggles, the show brings an endearing warmth to what is usually seen as the sport of humourless brutes.There are a few negative aspects of this anime and I can sum that up to two things and that would be the animation and the pacing right at the beginning. Now let me explain why, firstly the animation in the first instalment of Hajime No Ippo I would is pretty outdated especially when compared to recently released animes. Secondly I think that the pacing of this anime right at the beginning is not up-to par mainly because it drags on a bit to much and that could potentially put of a lot of viewers.I believe that is main reason why most people drop this anime and it honestly is a real shame because if you've ever heard of the expression save the best for last, this anime truly adheres to that and then some. Overall Few anime could rival this series in the shounen ring, but certainly none of the other sports anime on the market to date. By the end, food and sleep had become peripheral concerns - to sustain myself all I needed was to tap into the show's incredible energy, and believe me that is understatement. So if you truly feel like watching an anime that keeps you on your toes and gives you the aspirations to power through two-hundred squats and and push up's, yea maybe that was just me, but seriously I believe that this anime is truly magnificent and I strongly believe that the majority of people that watch this anime will agree! Thank you for taking the time to read this review, and if you found this helpful or not let me know.",
        "Hajime No Ippo (Knockout in Philippines and Fighting Spirit here in the US)is a must for all sports fans. Heck, I recommend this series to anyone. If you like sports (especially boxing), you will love the authenticity in which the animators present the boxing concepts and realism, not to mention the gradual development of the protagonist, Ippo Makunouchi. In addition,all the other characters are well-developed, so well-developed that you might even cheer for the guy Ippo is fighting. If you just like anim\u00e9 in general, this series has superior animation. You could feel the punches grinding on the boxer's bodies. If you are a newcomer, fear not. This series is one of the funniest anim\u00e9s ever. This is an overall superior anim\u00e9. If you never watched anim\u00e9 in your life, or just looking for a good series to watch, this is it.",
        "Spoiler for those who haven't watched it:If you are into fighting or boxing this anime you must see and also if you like comedy too.This anime has been made for you.I always get hyped when I see the matches it is always so great to watch this anime.I watch it again and again get hyped,laugh too much because of Takamura especially he is one of the most funny character in that anime You will know it when you watch the whole anime and it hasn't been completed yet and it is very long it has chapters like above 1009 or something.Ippo also has someone she likes and in the last chapters they were just going to kiss but they stopped because Kim's brother came.I will say it again if you are into comedy and action and adventures this anime is made for you.Ippo also challenges Miyata but Miyata refuses because fate doesn't want that to happen.This mango is one of the longest,funniest and one of the most adventurous manage that I have read in a while. :-)",
        "Whether you're a boxing fan or not, the sharp writing, lovable characters, and inspirational nature of this Anime will definitely be able to hold your attention. The OST is composed brilliantly and fits perfectly with a boxing atmosphere. The pacing of the Anime definitely breaks any monotony it may build up as the passage of time leads to the characters having improved so much they almost box entirely differently. The back stories are well written and hard to forget, even the filler which is extremely rare feels like a treat to watch as you wait to uncover the back story of a character you've known for quite awhile.Ippo's story of his struggle to overcome the challenges he faces by sheer effort and willpower will inspire you, and the twists and well placed cliffhangers will keep you wanting to watch more by the end of each episode.I strongly recommend Hajime no Ippo (Fighting Spirits in the US) to anyone of nearly any age.",
        "I hold any work that can force emotion in extremely high regard;\nThe camaraderie, empathy and resolve we hope for in Leon (a protagonist that in society would be disregarded and ignored).The sheer horror from the inability to comprehend non existential thoughts/beings and the ultimate influence and motive in The Shining.Hajime no ippo manages to force emotion in almost every genre. I cried with laughter, I gritted my teeth with painful restraint, I shared their friendship, I accepted loss, I celebrated wins.The best part about all of this is you can share these emotions with near most all of the characters introduced.Most of all this taught me to respect and appreciate a sport I previously thought was barbaric.The soundtrack is incredible and the art style and direction is bursting with passion and empathy, you can feel every punch and relate to the hard work and drive that goes into every fight and training regime.Absolutely incredible anime that I cannot recommend enough (also nearly every boxer has a real life counterpart to some degree).",
        "Fighting Spirit is better than the Dragon Balls Z or most other famous and popular TV anime shows about fights because it is more matured and realistic in its drawing style, plot, characterization, and animation technology. Animes like the Dragon Balls and most Hayao Miyazaki works are intended for little kids, at least in Japan, but the Flighting Spirit was late night show, intended for older teens and adults. It should also appeal to the female audience who get turned off by silly fantasy girls with gross body shapes or stupid voices in typical anime. I don't care about most anime shows, but I love this series. Try it and judge for yourself!",
        "Well what can I say? I watch a lot of Japanese anime like Bleach, One Piece, Naruto Shippudden and pretty much everything that involves fighting. Came across this, just recently and couldn't keep my eyes off it. From start to finish, it's just a trip of great training, great fights, great comedy, really great great fun. The characters are just perfect. We have Makunouchi Ippo the main character who is a shy type of lad, but on the ring... The supporting characters are awesome, all of them, Takamura, Miyata, Coach, Aoki, Kimura and all of the opponents fit in very nicely with the main crew. The interaction between Ippo and his opponents is also great! If you are not an anime fan then I assure you after watching this you will be converted. This is really great stuff and mainly for adults. Cartoons are for kids people, but this is way beyond that!!!",
        "It is the best sports anime I have ever seen and it is my best anime.",
        "This anime series has jaw dropping fights and the training is just straight up motivational and fun to watch it even made me get up the bed and do some shadow boxing. Overall the actual boxing is somewhat realistic. The characters are very likeable and seeing them have fun and mess with each other is very fun to watch also. I think everyone should see this anime in their life. 10/10."

    "The Future Diary": [
        "Aw man, life would be great if our mobile phones tell us what's going to happen to us in future! Unfortunately it's only a dream that we would all would love lol! This anime was pretty intense though, No.1 being the target to all the others who all have the same type of phone as him! Even the scene where that terrorist girl blowing up the school while Yuki and Yumo were inside!Really good horror anime, it deserves a 8/10 rating from moI! :D",
        "This show is extremely entertaining. The animation isn't as good as it could've been (that might be because I watched rips on YouTube though) but the story and concept is great. There are a lot of contradictory scenes where it seems like the writers forgot what had happened in previous episodes and its really funny in its incompetence (ex. there is an episode where two of the main characters jump out of a 3rd or 4th story window and are fine but in a later episode when they are on the 2nd floor they're worried about falling though a big hole in the floor even though they're running for their lives). The characters can also be inconsistent, which is also funny in its own way. What really makes this show is the story and how insane it gets. There is so much crazy in this show and I love it. If you're a fan of the absurd and dark humor and can put up with some plot holes - then I'd highly recommend this show.",
        "Middle school student Yukiteru Amano is plagued by feelings of loneliness. Only the imaginary being Deus Ex Machina keeps Yukiteru company and explains to him that he is the god of space and time. Deus Ex Machina modifies Yukiteru's cell phone so that it predicts its owner's future in a cell phone diary. But after Yukiteru becomes the owner of the new cell phone, he must participate in a game of life and death with other chosen diary owners in order to determine a worthy successor to Deus Ex Machina in the end, with the active support of his classmate Yuno Gasai.I liked \"Mirai Nikki\" the best of this type of anime, in the other animes the focus is more on the gameplay, but here there are really strong characters that are presented with beautiful animations.",
        "Before going any further You need to watch to OVA (really should be episode 27) to close out the storyline, after watching it you can decide which path was better.\nOf course finding the OVA is the problem.\"Future Diary\" start to finish is an unusual ride, filled with pain, brutality, kindness, hope, despair, so many other conflicting emotions and actions it's a wonder everyone involved doesn't go mad, and it does it pretty well.Really makes you question why someone would hold a challenge for Godhood, do all of what's done..\nBut you should always ask why another entity would willingly step aside and what the catches are..",
        "Yuna is the only thing that made me watch this to the end. She is magnetic character, she is not as good as Anderson in Helsing Ultimate to rate this 2 stars like i did with Helsing. Still one of the worst series i've ever seen.",
        "Being a Japanese Animation fan and seeing the general high ratings of the series I ended up watching the anime, it was a big disappointment. The initial plot looked amazing about a phone which tells you what's going to happen in the future and then a survival game between such users. The actual animation was also good and that about sums it all up for the positives for the anime. Everything else was crap. The script & the story were just plain horrible, as the series progressed it kept going downhill, from stupid characters, to unbelievable plots, nothing made sense. None of the characters are likable or believable, they may start out decent but the script always twisted them in some way or the other. There are too many plot holes to count. With the stupid story-line anime seemed targeted at kids but with the amount of nudity it couldn't be aimed at them. Just don't understand who the target audience was.",
        "The premise of 'The Future Diary' (aka 'Mirai nikki') is an anime-typical one: the god of the universe tries to find a successor by pitting twelve people against each other in a fight to the death. Each contestant has a 'future diary', a cellphone that can tell certain aspects of the short-term future. The protagonist, Yukiteru, is the anime-typical kind yet isolated middle-school boy. Together with his love interest, Yuno, he tries to defend himself from the other ten contestants' attacks.What sounds like a fairly generic premise is quickly derailed by one of the main characters being an utter sociopath. Alliances of convenience rise and fall every few episodes, and the character development is quite remarkable.While this show might seem like something primarily aimed at teenagers (such as shows with somewhat similar premises like the 'Fate' franchise), 'Future Diary' contains some seriously gruesome scenes featuring, for example, gang rape. The violence is not much more graphic than other shows, but the nudity certainly is (including bare breasts with nipples, which is pretty uncomfortable considering that most of the characters are middle-schoolers).I'd say that the show needs a few episodes to really get going, but it's filled to the brim with suspense afterwards. I especially liked the characters and their interactions, particularly between the protagonist and his love interest, though one of the support characters seems to be lifted directly from Neon Genesis Evangelion (including his character design and the central points of his subplot).The animations are pretty good but not extremely so, and the overall production value remains high. The English voice cast does a good job.There is an OVA ('Redial') that serves as an epilogue to the rest of the series.",
        "For around the first 2/3 or so, I was thinking that this could be one of the greatest anime created, if the ending held up. However, that did not happen. It wasn't hard to follow, but I feel like it tried to make itself more complicated just to be more complicated. And I didn't exactly hate the ending, but it wasn't good either. It did have a really good twist, and overall I'm glad I watched it, but what could have been great turned into something that wasn't all that special towards the end.",
        "Wow. What an amazing tale- I was riveted, from start to finish. The twists and turns were enthralling and each of the characters became favorites. What a clever little tale. Not for the faint of heart, this isn't a show for kids, despite having two young lead characters. The themes this show presents are deep and visceral. Quite an experience, as a whole.",
        "It is always difficoult to give unique number as rating in these cases when you have many lows and many peaks, like this series here.What is for sure it is not an anime for soft hearted, there are continuous switches, frightenings and almost any kind of violence, so any fluffy rating I saw in europe (12-14-16?!) is wrong, defitively not for minor; more than 7stars I can not give due to the Reisuke's pixelated scenes.Yukiteru (the protagonist) is a soft, closed, faint-hearted teen with no ambitions at all, so at the beginning it will be irritating to carry on with this sack of potatoes due to his character, but but but...\nIf you are able to hold on till the point when he suffer the greatest loss, then the story (with his behaviour) change completely, he starts to act like a man, this part is great (E.g. I remember when after 5days he abruptly show up with Yuno in front of the gods, awesome).There is no substantial fanservice but miss \"Mao Nonosaka\" who keep following Hinata everywere (for pretty clear reasons) and Yukiteru's father who act like a perv in some scenes (but maybe here they wanted to enphatize he has a bad character).",
        "I like the idea of this anime, but it does a bad job of executing the premise. The characters are one dimensional, it has terrible \"humor\" at the worst parts, and of course it is fully censored as nearly every anime series is over the past decade unless you get the blu-ray. Hard pass on this one, especially the overplayed Yandere plot tool - every single Yandere acts the same way which makes the character type boring as hell. This will be my last anime review, just tired of the genre after over 25 years of watching it. The censorship, Japanese \"humor\" that falls flat, and bad character designs just ruin so much of it that I can't be bothered.",
        "its kinda hard to review this without giving too much away...plus the 1st episode aired 26wks ago now, so my memory of how it started is a bit hazy...Yukiteru loves playing around on his phone and has an imaginary friend named Deus. But Deus is not imaginary, and Yuki gets caught up in a strange battle royale type game where the players, all holding phone diaries like Yuki's, must kill each other off until the final survivor becomes a God. Their diaries each predict the future in different ways, allowing them to evade or capture each other. One of Yuki's cute classmates, Gasai Yuno, has a diary and is strangely attracted to Yuki for reasons he can't quite understand...This showed rocked! Yuno is an awesome femme fatale, and all the other characters are well written too...the animation is great and the story action packed and violent (probably not for kids)...Yuki is a bit of a pussy, but he mans up over time...still, you can't blame him for being a bit hesitant to kill friends and strangers alike...watch this for sure!",
        "The description of this show doesn't do it justice by far! This show is SOO much darker and more violent then it sounds or looks, i can't count how many times my jaw was left open and i was saying to myself \"did that really just happen? I can't believe this, omg..\". On top of that there are quite a bit of really funny moments(more in the beginning and middle, the end is more serious). If you've seen Deadman Wonderland, its very similar in terms of a young man forced into killing others to survive or don't kill and become the victim. The main characters girlfriend (a main character shes in every single episode) makes this show so freaking good, if you don't love her you have problems haha. This anime is all about blood, violence, immorality, & romance(in a sick way, not your normal slice of life romance). This is a must watch show, hands down one of the best animes I've seen. I've also seen both OVAs the 8minute one is basically a very vague look at episode 1, i wouldn't advise watching it as its 100% pointless and a waste of time. The second OVA is Miria Nikki: Redial and shows you what happens after episode 26 so basically episode 27, its very good although i don't think its in English dub at this point of me writing this, definitely watch the redial if you enjoyed the first 26 episodes.Overall: 5/5. Was exactly what i wasn't expecting and i loved that surprise, i loved how violent, bloody, and so much sicker then i was expecting it to be. Highly recommended! :)",
        "I love this anime very much its written very well everything about it is so good. It totally worth your time i would recommend this to anyone has some NSFW scenes here and there but the plot is perfection, the art style is gorgeous, all the characters have been written so well. i cant say enough about this show. The redial was as good as the show. There is absolutely nothing bad about it i love it a lot.",
        "I didn't hate this show. It started out FANTASTIC and stayed fantastic for a very long time. It started off relying on suspense and psychological horror which couldn't be more effective. The story and characters were also really well-done and in-depth, and it didn't take itself too seriously.However, the reason I gave it 7 stars is because that was only for the first 3/4 of the show, and the last 1/4 is when there were some pretty big problems.Near the end of the show, the main character changed from his timid, merciful personality to more of a warlord. While I like development and changes in characters, that was a little too much, I would've liked to stay the way he was instead. And before that they didn't really keep the established character he was supposed to be. Also, the aforementioned psychological horror changed to just action instead and a very anticlimactic apocalypse plot.However, by episode 22, I was just plain mad. Episode 22 COMPLETELY messed up the character development, killed off literally every character you've come to know and love, and made the main character borderline despised (not to give any spoilers). The killing off of other characters quickly changed from emotional to just downright excessive. There were so many reasons to avoid killing off those 4 characters, so many other, much better ways for what should happen. But instead, that happened, and it made me really mad.From then on, the whole show kind of went downhill. The ending was somewhat satisfying, but not very satisfying because it still already ruined the established characters and story line. The OVA at the end didn't fix any problems, and kind of instead made all new ones.However, it wasn't the anime's fault, it was completely faithful to it's source material. But even so, the creator should've known to be consistent and not kill off so many characters.All in all, it wasn't a bad show, but it was so close to being a perfect show. It started off great, got better around the middle, but then got bad near the end. It would've been one of my favorite anime if it didn't have so many mistakes in the rest of the plot.",
        "Future Diary (Mirai Nikki) is an anime that was on between October 2011 and April 2012. It's a survival game among 12 people who have mobile phones receiving diaries about what will happen in several minutes within the future. Each future diary holder receives a future from a different perspective. So, the diary holders fight each other while avoiding their expected death by knowing the future.The survival concept in a story such as Battle Royal, where everyone has to be killed until only one person remains, is not new. So you may figure it would be another survival story where only the protagonist survives in the end. But this survival game is interesting in that the diary folders use techniques in order to change their expected future. Another striking thing that stands out is that Yuno's love toward Yukiteru goes out of control to be psychotic and violent, showing her affection crazily to him. Although a typical 'Yandere' character like Yuno would be annoying, I could even develop a love for this crazy character toward the end. I think it's a new type of survival story in that the audience could be moved by a 'Yandere' girl.Meanwhile, I couldn't help but compare the character Aru Akise from Future diary with Kaoru Nagisa from Neon Genesis Evangelion because both are played by the same voice actor, and the character's personality and the feature are very similar. Once I started comparing the two anime, I realized that there are other common points between the two. The protagonist, Yukiteru is shy, naive, cries easily, and a negative person, which is similar to Shinji in Evengelion. A similar character to Asuka found in Future Diary would be Yuno Gasai in that she is strong, sort of crazy, and strong-minded. You might find some other similarities while you watch Future Diary after Evengelion.While I was wondering if the two anime have some common themes in the characters, I was drawn to the story of Future Diary towards the end. It is painful and upsetting to see Yuno's unruly character where she doesn't care for anybody but Yukiteru, and she cannot be in love with him. But I felt like I could accept everything from her in the end.Overall, I like Future Diary. So I give it 8 stars.",

        "This wonderful anime, based of Sake Esuno's manga of the same name (and loyal to it, completely), unfortunately it didn't received the same recognition as most of the other animes or mangas that we were aware of; and it is very understandable, becuase you couldn't compare it to Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma 1/2, Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon, Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball, Eiichiro Oda's One Piece or Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto (of courses, there is no obvious comparison among those mangakas and their creations).All I could say to all of you, that happened to want to give it a try to this one: do it. If you happened to like very depressing themes, such as controversial subjects; then this one is for you. And one piece of advice: do not, I repeat, do not blink or take you eyes away from it, because anything you miss, it is very crucial to understand the story; and if that do not help you understand, watch it again.",
        "Wrote a review for this anime that didn't get posted for some reason. I feel obligated to do it again since it's one of the few I liked from this genre. The premise is that god needs to pick a successor. So he pits 12 people out into the world against each other in a last man standing game, the winner getting to ascend to godhood. They are also each equipped with a diary that gives them glimpses into the near future. There are 2 main protagonists interlocked. The first one is a reclusive high school boy named Yukiteru that is utterly incapable to do harm even to protect himself. The second one is his classmate, the beautiful Yuno that is more than capable and willing to kill for Yukiteru, because she claims she loves him. Even though they hardly interacted in the past. The relationship dynamic between the two main characters is what hooked me: an unstable stalker protecting the kind but also non combative boy she loves, from various would be killers. Throughout the series the link between the two protagonists changes them, reaching a deeply moving conclusion. It's a story about loss, suffering and how love can overcome all of that. However the violence and cruelty inflicted for the sake of the one you care about is clearly emphasized. It made me contemplate morality in situations where anything should technically be allowed. And this is why this superb series didn't get a higher rating. One reviewer even went as far as calling it an \"anime hell\". While I don't generally judge the tastes of other people I can't help but wonder if that person was expecting just another typical anime. Ironically it doesn't even feel like an anime. There are very few tropes used. There are a few explicit images but they serve a point. Characters grow throughout the show, their reasoning changes and therefor things might not go as you predicted. That's not a \"logical mistake\" it's called having a plot. For the most part the flashy absurd fighting visuals specific to anime are replaced by more believable and shocking violence. The one genre specific cliche used however was the physical design of one of the opposing contestants. She looked like an absurd oversized toy. It is the only reason why I can't rate this show a perfect ten due to how she clashed with the seriousness of the theme. I cherish this show and what it instilled in me so much that I frantically searched for other anime that could make me experience the same feelings. All paled in comparison...",
        "The concept of the story is the basis for the most if not the entirety of the show, and it keeps up to the mark. Mirai Nikki depicts a really interesting concept of 'Future Diaries; that predict the timeline of the show, mixed with a Battle Royale between the users of the said abilities.The limelight of the story belongs to the eccentric Yuno Gasai (you'll know what I mean eccentric), the co-protagonist who plays an equivalent role if not more than the other co-protagonist, Yukiteru Amano, a stereotypical shy guy character, an often character-trope of modern anime. Despite the mundane expected characteristics of Yukitaro, he indeed develops through the story, which leads to a justified ending of the entire plot.The side-characters play a fundamental role of in the climbing-up of the protagonists in the Battle Royale genre, but it is not linear to the audience's expectations. That's where the elements of gore and psychological thriller comes in, the latter overlapping with romance. The said elements provide an uncertainty to the flow of the story to audience, bringing in wild and bizarre changes in the storyline, which makes things interesting.The pacing of the 26-episode seemed pretty okay until the story in the later episodes take an out-of-the-world turn of events, often a reason disappointed in anime nowadays. Similar occurrences were observed in anime like the recent DARLING IN THE FRANXX (which is a really good example of the folly in context), or GURREN LAGANN. The story goes linear in development until things jump beyond comprehension from the expected storyline to make things complicated. In the circumstance, the writers simply doesn't want to keep things simple anymore, but put in some other worldly desires to make things sci-fi beyond common scene. An unusual exception to this folly is the story of STEINS;GATE, which maintains control over the plot and development despite the said show being pretty sci-fi from the beginning.Enough with the ranting, MIRAI NIKKI has a decent ending justified to the consequences (not inclusive of any dark side) of the storyline. It will pique interest for gore and psycho-thriller lovers and I'll recommend anime/manga enthusiasts to give the story a shot, to whoever haven't viewed it.",
        "What a mess!The future diary has a great concept, and nothing else.The characters are badly written, except for Yuno. She is the only interesting character in the entire anime.The story is a huge mess. There's no buildup and no proper storyline. Everything happens out of the blue. Every character finds whatever they need to survive or escape within seconds. With every episode this anime gets worse.Animation is not bad. It's watchable.It's not for someone who wanna watch an anime with a proper storyline. It's for the people who like watching violence and blood...... And i mean just violence and blood.4/10.",
        "Every once in awhile I will watch an anime, and at the end of watching it I will sometimes think, 'What the heck did I just watch'? But in the end, I will look back and think of how complex the story was and how it was well thought-out until the very end. The Future Diary is one of those animes.Here we have a bunch of people trying to kill each other to become a god, using different diaries that can tell the future. This story is very well thought out but also extremely complex in its own right. There will always be a feeling of suspense and you wonder what is going to happen next. You will think, what will happen now, and after that, and after that. But every time a question is answered, immediately another takes its place to basically try and blow you away. And sometimes this works, and sometimes it doesn't. That being said there were plenty of moments when I was like, 'What?' And it forced me to think, and question my previous answers which made the show a little bit more complicated until it all tied together in the end... sort of. Now the constant suspension and turn-around moments in this anime may throw some people off, but all in all this is a very enjoyable anime. If you are not shy of blood, suspense, sex, and complete mind-boggling questions, then this is a show for you. As I said before some might be turned off by the constant complexity and changes in the story, but you may still enjoy it. Give it a shot, and you might just be as surprised as I was.",
        "If you enjoy turning your brain off and watching a loose thread of plot points with cute anime characters you might enjoy this anime. I did not enjoy this anime. It really does just makes no sense and I swear it reminded me of redo of healer in a lot of ways.",
        "The concept alone for Mirai Nikki was actually very interesting, but the execution of that concept was a total waste on this anime.1) Most of the characters you're suppose to get invested in are not only unlikable, but most of their actions aren't even the least bit realistic. Yuki is one of the most poorly-written characters I have seen in any anime, being nothing more than a loser, sack of sh*t crybaby that has no depth whatsoever. The same can be said about Yuno, who also lacks depth and her motives are often never explained.2)The story itself is riddled with plot holes and contains plenty of inconsistencies. Most actions made by the characters were so contrived, it was laughable. Even the anime itself doesn't take anything seriously when one of the characters looks like a stuffed strawberry shortcake doll or when a woman farts out rockets and a motorcycles comes out from in between her legs. 3)The fact that this anime tries to use rape as a plot device not only once, but twice, is simply mind-boggling. It just shows how tasteless the writing can be.4)The animation was passable, though the use of CG for one of the characters is just laughably terrible.So much wasted potential is what this anime is."

    "Mononoke": [
        "Every movie viewer has different tastes and sometimes a film appeals to one person and not another, or vice-versa. I know that this film set attendance records in Japan and is adored by many and I will admit that TECHNICALLY it is a super well-made film--with nice animation throughout--and in many ways better than the average Disney film. However, despite all this, I just felt very little connection to PRINCESS MONONOKE as the story didn't interest me very much and lacked the charm of other Miyazaki films. Apart from the cute little forest spirits, it was obviously a very adult film and was 180 degrees different from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, my personal favorite Miyazaki film. So, if you like the cute style Miyazaki films like me, you'll probably not appreciate this film as much as others who want a film with an agenda that focuses on nature and conservation. As for me, I don't want a message film--I want one that is just plain fun.",
        "Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated movies I have seen in a long time, and is up there with Studio Ghibli's best along with Spirited Away. I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
        "In feudal Japan, Ashitaka protects his village and kills an attacking demon boar. Part of the curse infects his arm. Village elder tells him to travel west to find a cure and encounters a monk who tells him about the great forest spirit. In Irontown, he finds leader Lady Eboshi who freed girls from the brothels and trying to perfect her guns. She is cutting down the forest and killing its animals. Her holy grail is to cut off the head of the forest spirit. She is opposed by animals of the forest and Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolves.I really like the spirits of the forest. I wonder if the movie needs a true villain. Lady Eboshi is more of a Captain Ahab character. The conflict doesn't have the same punch. The other main problem is the clunky dubbed dialog. It really takes work to make the dialog sound natural and not just simple translations. Overall, this has some great imaginative concepts and spirits. This is a special animated movie.",
        "I'm not a huge fan of anime, so I'm not the best person to review this film. Nonetheless I found myself watching it to find out what all the fuss was about.Initially, I found the film gripping. The old-fashioned animation felt fresh and I loved watching the colourful panoramas play out on screen. The early scenes involving the terrible forest monster chasing the film's hero were vivid and exciting; then Princess Mononoke is introduced.Gradually, I lost interest in the film. I found the story far too slim to support the lengthy running time. Myriad characters are introduced and underdeveloped, and the emphasis seems to be on repetitive action involving the different factions battling each other. Certain sequences are certainly captivating on the animation front - especially the huge, translucent forest god creature - but the story just didn't keep my attention.",
        "When I first saw this film in 1997, it was in its original Japanese version, I was blown away by the animation, but found the story a little hard to follow, my second viewing, featured the English voices, and allowed the pieces to come together.The animation, still looks incredibly fresh, twenty six years old, and still wonderfully detailed, bright and packed with detail, better than anything at the time. The music was equally brilliant.I am surprised still that it hasn't been adapted into a live action movie, the story is a truly brilliant one, it's entertaining, moving, exciting, but it doesn't at any point preach at the viewer, it isn't heavy handed, but it does deliver a pretty big message.It's the perfect mix of art and entertainment, a few sequences make me think it's suitable more so for a mature adult, some scenes may be upsetting for younger children.In terms of the voices, I really liked Claire Danes and Gillian Anderson, I was a bit mixed with Billy Bob Thornton's voice, I'm not too sure it worked with his character.Overall, it was excellent.9/10.",
        "\"Mononoke-hime\" or \"Princess Mononoke\" is a Japanese animated film from 1997, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year. I think this was not or at least not primarily the reason why it was shown again here at a local movie theater, but it was part of a film series with focus on anime. No big surprise because this is (considered) one of the classics. Writer and director is Hayao Miyazaki who is probably associated with anime movies more than anybody else. He was in his mid50s when he made this film and is over 80 now. I see there are quite a few talented American actors attached to this project and they were part of the English-language voice cast of course. This includes talented folks like Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Crudup and Gillian Anderson, but also less talented performers like Claire Danes or the absolutely unbearable Jada Pinkett Smith. Sad to see her as part of this project. I watched the Japanese original with subtitles, so I cannot elaborate in-depth on the international voice cast here, but the Japanese did fine overall. No more details there either because I am simply not familiar with their names. Most likely my loss. At almost two hours and fifteen minutes, this is a very long film for the genre. It could almost have been turned into a miniseries as well with this duration I guess and could have worked as well, no matter if there had been three or six episodes. You will not really find an equally long Studio Ghibli film. The awards recognition for this film was there, but surely less spectacular than it would have been nowadays where without a doubt it would have been one of the big animation players at the Oscars as well as at the Annies. The English-language version did not change anything about that either.One striking aspect about this film here was that it took quite some time until the title character really became a factor in this film, even appeared in this film. We see her briefly on one occasion when the main character runs into her, but there is not really any dialogue, just him screaming something at her and definitely the male protagonist here is more of a central character. But this is no exception when it comes to anime that they name the film after the most crucial female character, even if she does not have as much screen time as her male counterpart. I think it was an alright decision though. The longer the film goes, the more Mononoke moves to the center of it all, even if the guy also never disappears from the action. They are basically fighting together. And they also need each other. There are several situations when they save each other's lives pretty much. When one of them is unconscious. Honestly, I must say that, even if I did not expect a supernatural power warrior, I was a bit baffled by how Mononoke really got in miserable situations again and again, like also when she is trapped by her antagonists on one occasion and the male character helps here there again too and basically carries her out of the village. How did he get both women unconscious though at the same time? Anyway, this was also a bit of a critical situation because he is shot by one of the women from the village and it was a shot that not many would have survived, but he was clearly on a mission. There are some very supernatural aspects in here, but the two main characters are really as human as it gets. The title character may live with wolves in the forest, but she is still nothing but a human. The guy may be a very strong and dedicated fighter, but he is also not a deity or so. But he is able to take one on when he has to as we see at the very start with this really gigantic boar that comes to wreak havoc to his village. He manages to defeat it and we are informed on a few occasions that the boar was possessed by either a demon or an evil god. We even hear this creature's voice at the end when he leaves the corpse. Some very deep and gruesome voices you hear on a few occasions, also for example when other boars are talking or also when wolves are talking.One special thing about the forest is that the creatures living there are all pretty gigantic. At least the wolves and pigs are. Maybe the monkeys too, they are just side characters, but we see through them that the animals inside the forest are also not always getting along well and they have their conflicts that could even turn violent on some occasion, even if they eventually don't. Then there are two deer creatures, the pretty likable pet (if you can call it that) that belongs to the male protagonist and a really big and powerful deer that is the fleshly form (if you wanna call it that) of the forest god. Not a permanent form because he switches back and forth though and we see him also in his other more spirit-like form and we also get to witness the transition. And we get to witness what happens when said deity is attacked by a human tribe and literally loses his head to their aggression. That was a shocking moment. Maybe not the best idea to do that to a god and the consequences are massive as well. How he goes looking for his head and what happens to the forest at the same time. The ending is almost the now you could say. Green everywhere and the God is all over the place, but not really tangible anymore. There were mentions of said god deciding about life and death and I must say I am a bit curious how he did not kill the woman who did this to him. I will get to her in a second. For now, it can also be said that the male protagonist is not soft at all either. He also decapitates two people early on his journey that are about to commit crimes. Then there is the one who gives him advice that he should be careful when people are following him. Seemed like more of a comedic inclusion early on, but he is also a pretty (head)strong character as we find out quickly and somebody you should be very careful with. We understand this when he eventually returns.Now, as for the woman, I mentioned earlier, she was maybe not really less interesting than Mononoke. You could never be sure what was up with her. On several occasions, she seemed grateful towards the protagonist and not afraid to show it in front of her people, on the other she is a violent schemer who wants to conquer the world. She is not scared of killing forest creatures either. Basically, she goes there to kill the sacred deer even, the god of them all. In the end, she is more of a good character again when after her and her people's home got destroyed she says they will rebuild it. She also supports people with severe deformations and they themselves tell another character (and us) that nobody else except her ever really took care of them and gave them a decent life. Of course, this is also for her to move forward with her gruesome dreams, but still. She is probably also a bit of a feminist if you take a look at how she sometimes speaks about men or also how she paid to free these women, all the female villagers basically, from their prostitution backgrounds. The only thing you can surely say about her is that you can never really be sure with anything she was doing. Seeing her basically as the main opponent to Mononoke is something that also contributed to seeing her as the biggest villain here. But as I stated, there is a lot more to her. Some stuff also confused me, like I have no idea why she was heading to the forest with her men instead of staying with her \"army\" back in the village to protect the place when other enemies were potentially approaching. Instead she was heading out for a fight against nature and took her best men with her of course. She was also a gifted fighter herself as we see, on par with Mononoke. As for the latter, it's a really cool character and I enjoyed watching her for sure, but I still felt her story as well as the film's overall story sometimes tried to be a bit too much for the film's own good, so I cannot really share the overwhelming praise this film has received and also that it is inside the imdb top250. You can see that from my rating. I liked the watch, but not more and I am generally somebody who digs a good environental message and story and this film has a lot to offer in this department.Where it does not have a lot to offer is the comedy. Most anime films, also the older ones, deliver quite a few moments where the audience can laugh, but here these are almost not existent. Maybe you can make a case for the moments relatively early with how the village women are reacting towards the main character and also how they are reacting towards their men on the other hand, but that is really almost it. I guess they kept it serious throughout because Miyazaki did not want to take anything away from the dramatic plot overall and just have the audience focus entirely on ths seriousness of this film. All in all, the characters and the magic of it all are on a level where it is a decent watch for the entire family, also children, but pay attention again to how heads are severed here, also human ones, even if it can be seen very briefly only. I do like the poster here on imdb. Mononoke's somewhat indigenous mask is really cool and I wish we could have seen her wear it on more occasions. Her make-up underneath is fine too though. That is all then. Maybe this is a film that will impress me more on rewatch and I will perhaps see it again at some point, but not anytime soon. As of now, I would say that I found the animals and magic creatures there in the forest really far more interesting than the humans. I must also totally mention those little forest spirits that were so cool with the sounds they were making. There were so many of them, even if when introduced the one we see seemed like a rarity early on. I liked that the film ends with one of those too in the final shot. Pretty cool and I like the idea that our forests are full with these too. Okay, a lot of brainstorming from me in here, but I hope you got the essence. Thumbs-up for this film here.",
        "Studio Ghibli proved time and time again, that you can make animated movies that speak to all ages. Now of course that is also true for many Pixar movies or other studios. So I'm not trying to knock down other peoples efforts, if I see one I love I'll say so at that movies site. So me gving this the credit it deserves, is not even close to me dishing out critique on others.Especially not because of the content. While I do love it when there is an eco message in the movies (and that's another thing with Studio Ghibli, or rather was, since they retired), it doesn't mean I can't enjoy a silly animated movie too (whatever it may be, Pets, Despicably me and so forth). Having put that out of the way, there are so many things included here, that even if you didn't know it was from Studio Ghibli, they have their way of telling stories, of animating them, of putting characters into them (and into peril). Mostly with a lot of innocence, but also a lot of violence too. They don't shy away from showing certain aspects of life (like death, the circle of life, with blood and all).So if you can bare that, the struggle is real and it is very well made. Tension from start to finish, with quite some ambiguity too ...",
        "When he is touching by a demon while defending his village, Ashitaka is sent out to the West, from where the crazed demon originated, seeking a cure for the demon infection that will otherwise kill him.  However, in seeking the domain of the gods he walks into the middle of a three-way battle between the samurai, who want Iron Town's iron deposits; Lady Eboshi who rules Iron Town and is stripping the forest of it's trees to mine it out; and finally the animals and spirits of the forest who must defend their homes, fighting for them is the human Mononoke, a young woman raised by the wolves.It is hard to top Spirited Away, and it is maybe unfair of me to come to this film after I had seen that.  This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film who's story is it's strength and weakness.  The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai).  However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away.  The obvious message of peace between man/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesn't look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesn't quite manage it.  The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying.  I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters.  However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka.  Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her.  Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast.  Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast.  I say ironically because I couldn't place him in comparison to the more famous cast.  Driver is OK but her character wasn't.  Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work.  Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didn't fit her character at all (even with the echo added).  Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai.  Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki.  It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is!  It is a little too gory to be for kids (even though it is rated pg in the UK) but the vast majority of it is as detailed as you wished more kids' animation was.Overall I really enjoyed this film but occasionally found it difficult to get past some of it's weaknesses.  The characters are not all as strong as I would have liked and some of their voices aren't that good.  The ending is a bit of a letdown as I was hoping for a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to the story.  Despite this, it is still a wonderful film and easily one of the best animations I have seen.",
        "This magnificent cartoon movie concerns Japanese legends , it begins when Ashikata, a prince warrior is wounded by a cursed giant boar . He attempts to encounter some way to heal incurable curse inflicted . Ashikata saddled in his red deer goes to the east, where finds the Iron Town , ruled by Lady Ebosi confronting Sam , the princess Mononoke, a human girl raised by wolves . Ashikata encounters in the middle of fighting among the forest animals : large wolves, giant boars and humans : emperor Mikado soldiers , Lady Ebosi soldiers and Shogun army . Furthermore, in the forest finds the deer god and spirits called Kodamas .This wonderful film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, drama, spectacular combats and with ecological message . The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and quite entertaining, though isn't apt for small kids but contains graphic violence . It's a deep critical about nature exploiting and killing the forests for the encroaching civilization represented by an iron mining town that cause a damage environment . This stunning film, though a bit too long, converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and around the world. The motion picture was splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki , he personally corrected or redrew more than 80,000 of the film's 144,000 animation cels . Being accompanied by sensitive music score composed by his usual musician , Joe Hisaishi. Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as \u00a8Howl's moving castle\u00a8 , \u00a8Chihiro\u00a8 , \u00a8Porco Rosso\u00a8 and \u00a8My neighbour Tororo\u00a8 . Rating : Sensational and fantastic , it's a masterpiece cartoon movie.",
        "A difficult story to follow and decidedly scary animation at times makes this more an adult film than one for younger fans. It's not too hard to follow in the early going but when the hero Ashitaki makes his way East to the land of the Forest Spirit he's faced with choices that put him on questionable sides of relationships already formed. While trying to save his own life endangered by a poisonous encounter with the boar demon Nago, his overriding mission is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hate'. For this he must valiantly strive to understand the motivations and prerogatives of those he meets, including monk Jigo, Lady Eboshi of Irontown and the wolf princess San, a human raised by wolves. In turn, each of these individuals comes to understand that good and evil are not mutually exclusive character traits, but exist in all to varying degrees. The way this all plays out can be confusing and is not made easier by the depiction of characters like Moro, the large threatening white wolf who by design one would consider a male, but in actuality is the mother of San. It's an intricately woven tale and loyal fans of anime will find it spellbinding, though I must admit, for myself it took a concerted effort to follow and understand.",
        "I remember Hayao Miyazaki's \"Mononoke-hime\" (\"Princess Mononoke\" in English) getting released in 1999 but I never saw it until now. Quite an accomplishment. Although a fantasy, it addresses humanity's relationship with the natural world, and also the question of how we define good and bad.Even though this is an animated feature, it's not one for the tykes. Far from the \"cute\" stuff often found in US animated features, this movie depicts war and a number of gruesome scenes (also addressing karma and the loss of innocence). But even so, everything is in the movie for a reason, and it amounts to one fine picture. It's rightfully earned its place among IMDb's top 250 and a spot in Steven Schneider's list of 1,001 movies to see before you die.",
        "I saw Japanese cartoon Spirited Away from Studio Ghibli before this film, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and I was fascinated to see another original animated story with the same imaginative style, dubbed into English. Basically a possessed boar tries to attack a small village, and as the one who defeated him, the creature infects young Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) with an incurable disease. The only way eh may be able to cure his curse is to travel far east and find either the deer God, who makes all plant life grow, or Princess Mononoke, aka San (Claire Danes), raised by wolf Gods and leading the forest animals in the war. Ashitaka is also trying to intervene with the war between the forest and mining colony Tataraba, as they fight for freedom and resources, with all sorts of weird and wonderful characters, creatures, spirits and Gods getting involved. Also starring Gillian Anderson as Moro, Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi, Jada Pinkett Smith as Toki, Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo, Keith David as Okkoto and Futurama's John Di Maggio as Gonza. The story is a little strange, but bare in mind it is Japanese, but with good dubbing voices and aspiring animation, you'll enjoy the experience. It was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, and it was number 43 on Film 4's 50 Filsm To See Before You Die. Very good!",
        "I'd heard good things about this film before seeing it and was not disappointed. The animation and story are excellent as one would expect from a Hayao Miyazaki film. Be warned however that this film isn't as gentle as his other films, we see several people having their heads and limbs removed although this is not shown in graphic close-up.I liked the fact that the conflict between the villagers and the forest creatures wasn't depicted as a clear cut case of good versus bad and like most of Miyazaki's films it has strong female characters that are neither damsels in distress nor trying to marry their Prince Charming like many western animated heroines.The film opens with a possessed giant boar thundering out of the forest and attacking a village. The boar is slain by Prince Ashitake but not before it wounds him. He is told that the found is part of a curse that will ultimately kill him if he doesn't leave his village and seek out the Deer God in forests far to the west.When he gets there he finds the forest creatures in conflict with the inhabitants of a village who are clearing areas of forest to find ore for their iron works. It turns out that Lady Eboshi, the leader of the village, had fired the shot that had caused the boar to be cursed. She is not a typical film villain though as she is very protective of her village and employs former prostitutes and lepers who wouldn't be treated so well elsewhere.Fighting against her is San (Princess Mononoke) a girl that has been raised by the Wolf goddess Moro in the forest and despises humans, and various forest creatures. When she attacks the iron works in a plan to kill Lady Eboshi, Ashitake intervenes to stop them killing each other. As he is taking San out of the village he is seriously wounded but she takes him to the deer god who cures this wound but not the curse.As well as these protagonist there is Jigo who has been employed my the emperor to bring back the head of the deer god as he believe it will give him the power over life and death.I can't comment on the quality of the English dubbing as I've only watched the subtitled version so far.",
        "On a journey to find the cure for a Tatarigami's curse, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods and Tatara, a mining colony. In this quest he also meets San, the Mononoke Hime.While Americans rarely see much for cartoons beyond the world of Walt Disney (or perhaps Don Bluth), we can thank fantasy author Neil Gaiman for getting this Japanese film properly released in the states. Between \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"Spirited Away\", there is much to be seen in the way of Japanese animation beyond the omnipresent anime.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke \"a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year.\" He is not alone in that sentiment. Almost twenty years later, the film has not decreased in its critical praise.",
        "Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side. The title character is part of the latter, though also human, bringing a little more of the underlying symbolism with a character. Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. There are even moments I would say that, had I been little and watching some of the more twisted and macabre scenes, I might have cried from it. But this is a credit to Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli; for older kids this could mark as something that is, indeed, foreign to their expectations, at least American ones. It is a work of art, not just animation, that takes chances and isn't afraid to go for the right twists and leaps of creation and at the same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing. It's a film I can't wait to see again, and likely my favorite of the filmmaker's too, with the same cinematic drive as in the other works I've seen but reaching the ambitious heights it intends.",
        "Okayish...as a kid's movie.Set in a fantasy world, a young man, Ashitaka, is injured defending his village from a giant pig-like demon. The prognosis for his injury is that it will deteriorate and eventually kill him. He can be saved if he finds the cure, which will require a long quest...Pretty much your standard Hayao Miyazaki movie. Good set up, with a fair degree of intrigue. However, the intrigue dissipates quite quickly as the movie degenerates into a long, rambling adventure with no real themes emerging. Add in lack of character depth and thus lack of character engagement and you have: random plot, shallow characters, no profundities - a movie lacking in substance. So, not ideal for intelligent adults.Kid's should enjoy it, though the longish running time may hinder that.",
        "Spoilers herein.The first thing I want is to be transported. The further the better, the more competently the better. This film transported me. It had quite a bit different take on the world -- heavihanded, confusing, illogical, juvenile mysticism, pop morality -- all different than what we are usually served up. Some of this strangeness (I am convinced) is because the director is a poor storyteller.Disney's ethic was that the simplicity in the art corresponded with a simplicity in the story, so much so that one could turn off the sound and get the story. Not just follow the story but follow the WHOLE story. Anime seems to want to turn that on its head, making the animation simpler than anything out of Disney, but blowing up the story complexity with so many threads that kids believe it is profound.No matter for me, the confusion and pseudodepth was part of the experience.But there is another element here, and that really did disappoint me. 'Akira' was genuinely artistic, not so much in the drawings themselves, but in the understanding of motion. I was impressed with how the edges on the screen corresponded to the edges between scenes. Akira had a similarly childish sense of the complexly profound, but the art showed mastery and self-awareness.The vision in this film is just plain unimaginative in how the motion is handled. I'm not talking about the quality of the animation (which is poor), but the depth of the art. And the images themselves lack imagination: a wormy boar as a demon; the nightwalker was straight out of scoobydoo; the wolfgods?; the smurfy sprites? None of this reaches deep.If you want an introduction to anime and are looking for art, go to 'Akira.' Don't even stop here.",
        "THIS is one of the most popular Japanese movies of all time???!!! Yes, there's some excellent animation and enough plot for 7 films BUT, not all the animation is good, the plot isn't exactly interesting and gets real silly at times (I gave up when the tigers and boars started having conversations), and the film is WAY too long (130 minutes). Also, the dubbing of the American voices doesn't help at all. The only one who works is Billy Cudup who voices the young hero--his voice fits perfectly. Billy Bob Thornton is horrible--his Texas accent sounds a little out of place in ancient Japan! (Also his character makes no sense and disappears completely in the middle of the movie). Claire Danes makes the princess sound like a spoiled brat and Minnie Driver's English accent sound uproarious on an evil(?) Japanese queen. That's the problem, she reads her lines so unsurely I didn't know how to take them! This is definitely a movie that lost A LOT in the translation. Also there's some real gruesome violence, so this isn't exactly for the kids. A waste of time unless you're amine fan.",
        "Princess Mononoke (1997) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Ashitaka, a warrior that protects his small woodland town from invaders. Unfortunately when attacked by a wild boar he is infected by a strange disease that is becoming more prevalent in the forest. Ashitaka seeks a cure for his infection in the forest. He runs into a war between the forest and humans as the humans look to destroy the forest and kill the magic that resides inside it.This movie is directed by legend Hayao Miyazaki (Howl's Moving Castle) and contains the voices of Billy Crudup (Big Fish), Billy Bob Thornton (Slingblade), Minnie Driver (Goodwill Hunting), Keith David (Requiem for a Dream), Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) and Jada Pinkett Smith (The Matrix).The animation for this is out of this world and brilliantly creates a fierce and magical world. The action scenes are outstanding and contains a great deal of realism with kills, injuries and drama. The characters are outstanding and well delivered and evolve throughout the film well. There is a tremendous message throughout the film and the ending is brilliantly mature.Overall this is an all time great, very smart and well done animated gem. I would consider this an absolutely must see and score it a 10/10.",
        "You really don't have to be into anime to appreciate some of the movies that the genre has to offer. Some of them are being simply so good and captivating that basically everybody should be able to get grabbed by it. And I feel that this is one of those movies, that is being a great blend of adventure and fairytale elements.It's really a movie that speaks to your imagination. It's set in a fantasy world, that still feels and looks a lot like our world and the movie is literally loaded with some great and impressive looking fantasy creatures, with the one even bigger and more amazing than the other. In essence this is a mankind versus nature type of movie, in which nature does a lot of fighting back! I can definitely see how \"Avatar\" got 'inspired' by this movie and it features some similar themes and at times also a similar type of atmosphere in it. And I should say though that I liked this movie far better than \"Avatar\"! The themes worked out better and were overall more effective and as a whole the story of this movie worked out more pleasantly.I should admit though that the movie can get quite hard to follow at times, will all of its things that are happening and characters that are in it. But this is a 'problem' I have with basically every anime and it very rarely ever ruins the movie experience for me, so it's no complaint or problem really. The movie has some great strong characters in it that can hold their own, amidst all of the great and powerful looking creatures in this movie. And there really are a whole bunch of characters in this movie but this never becomes anything distracting and the movie also never looses its focus. All thanks to some great storytelling skills of course, by Hayao Miyazaki.The animations are absolutely great looking and help to give the movie a great and effective fantasy atmosphere. What I also like about it is that's being such an easy thing to exaggerated things when your animation it, especially all of the action but everything in this movie feels 'real' and doesn't goes over-the-top with things, despite the presence of lots of fantasy elements and characters in it.Another thing worth mentioning is the musical score by Joe Hisaishi. Some great stuff!Whether you like anime or not, this is a great fantasy-adventure movie for everybody, everywhere!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.nl/",
        "When the young warrior Ashitaka protects his village from a Forest-God-turned-demon, the curse that had gripped it infects him, threatening his life. For the protection of his kin and in order to revert this process, he leaves on a journey. He finds a young woman running a lead mill crafting rifles, with ambitions of rule and no care for the damage she does to nature(and he is suffering some of the consequences). And thus we get the not-so-subtle message(hint: she represents mankind). \"Can't we all just get along\" is the idea, but it does actually take the problem more seriously(with a mature sensibility) than other of these, such as Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas, and most recently, Avatar. This also gets into the theme of anger and hate being self-destructive, not only harmful to one's surroundings. There are a lot of concepts in this, and fully comprehending and following it may require several viewings, time devoted to piecing it all together, and prior knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture. This is not for children, or even teens, but adults, setting it apart from every other Miyazaki production I've seen, which is nearly all of them. The acting is very good, and I urge you to watch this with subtitles, not dubbed. I do wonder why they did not sync up the animals, unlike the humans. The animation is excellent, with memorable designs, and mood expertly built by, among other things, the right amount(and tone, nuance) of light and dark(it also knows when and how to use sound, as well as silence). There is a bit of action, and it's intense, visually appealing and well-choreographed. Sans credits, this is 124 minutes long. The DVD comes with trailers for Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Porco Rosso, Ponyo, this and Howl's Moving Castle, 2 Promos(coming to a running time of 8 minutes), 3 teasers(2 minutes put together) and 6 TV spots(totaling at 2 minutes). There is a lot of disturbing content, and, what seems somewhat gratuitous, a little violence, blood, gore and hints of sexuality. I recommend this to fans of Anime and those who want films that deal with the environment. 8/10",
        "Princess Mononoke, like most of Studio Ghibli's output, has a Japanese sensibility which is quite alien to a western audience which has grown up on Disney and Looney Tunes. The story hardly matters - the striking visuals rule.The story is perfectly fine, though: its vague ecological message survives the other-wordly weirdness of demons, forest gods, and warring factions kept apart by a pair of unlikely peace brokers.But it looks terrific - character design, backgrounds and animation are all first rate. And its weirdness is part of its appeal. There's no guarantee that you will enjoy it but, if you give it a chance, there is a lot to enjoy here.",
        "For the first (and thankfully up to now,only time) time ever,I found myself in 2009 becoming completely disinterested in seeing films/TV shows,listening to new music and reading fiction novels,due to none of them really connecting with me at that point in time.Searching round for some DVD's to pick up for a friends birthday in late 2009 at a local HMV,I found myself strangely taken by the cover of a Japanamation title. With having never heard of the film before,I was caught by surprise,when I started to get a strong feeling that I had to pick up the DVD right away.Watching the DVD later that night,I found myself being left breathless by writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's complex,yet human plot,and also Studio Ghibli's, (the studio which Miyazaki founded) animation work being unlike anything that I had seen before.As I started to gather up titles to celebrate my upcoming 500th IMDb review,I decided that my 500th review would be the perfect time for me to take a look at my 5th favourite film of all time,which led to me excitingly getting ready for a very special meeting with Princess Mononoke.View on the film:Giving an intelligent cultural context in a narration adaptation by Neil Gaiman,each of the cast (in the English version) members give passionate performances,with Billy Bob Thornton giving the movie a soulful side as Jigo,and Billy Crudup brilliantly expressing Ashitaka's conflicting emotions on the deadly situation that he finds himself in.Joining the guys,Minnie Driver keeps away from giving Lady Eboshi a heart of iron by giving her a firm,but protective voice,with almost all of Eboshi's activates being linked to her wanting to do the best for the people of Iron Town.Perfectly matching her character design,Claire Danes gives a wild performance as San,with Danes showing the survival of the gods to be the thing that drives San's existence,whilst Gillian Anderson gives the film a meditating side,as the voice of the wolf god Moro.Personally drawing (or redrawing) 80,000 of the titles 144,000 animation cells,writer/directing auteur Hayao Miyazaki gives the last ever title to be filmed on plastic cells an astonishing send off. Showing no fear at all in making the movie mature,Miyazaki superbly gives each of the demonic gods a raw visceral edge by allowing blood to flow from every hole of their decaying bodies,with Miyazaki also showing a real eye for tough action scenes,as Ashitaka uses his demon powers to chop peoples arms off,and for decapitations.Contrasting the gory edges of the action scenes,Miyazaki shows an extraordinary eye for detail,with ever branch and leaf in the forest being individually drawn to beautiful detail that, gives the film a powerful Fantasy atmosphere,with Miyazaki also making the characters brilliantly fully dimensional, by allowing for all of their positive's and flaws to be expressed across their faces.Avoiding the risk of the screenplay becoming preachy,Miyazaki makes the environment issue one that is focused on the characters effects on the location,and not on the location itself. Keeping away from making Eboshi a boo-hiss villain,Miyazaki shows,that whilst Eboshi's battles are extreme,that they are firmly rooted to Eboshi wanting to make the residents of Iron Town's lives better.Giving Ashitaka an infection from the start,Miyazaki shows Ashitaka fight against his infection by developing a maturity in his complicated relationship with San,and also taking on the townsfolk and the woodland residence with an unwavering sense of determination,as Miyazaki reveals his Princess to be an unforgettable film.",
        "When a village is tormented by a wild boar, it falls to the young \"Ashitaka\" to sort it out. Turns out though, that it isn't an ordinary beast - and in the fight the man is afflicted with a curse that requires his journey to the great tree god to put right. His travels lead him to the unscrupulous \"Lady Eboshi\" who has developed a smelting process that enables her to make guns - giving her not only advantage against the other local clans, but also helping her on her quest to kill the gods and the wolves lead by the Princess Mononoke whom they have raised from infancy. The story is great, the colourful and detailed animation moves the fable along well and excitingly with plenty of solid characterisation and action a-plenty. As ever with Miyazaki, there is a moral to the story - and the last twenty minutes exemplify that beautifully. The English language dubbed version has a good cast injecting personality and an extra degree of emotion to the characters too. I did find the forest sprites just a bit too twee, but otherwise this is a great marriage of creativity and legend - and I really enjoyed it.",
        "I guess you'd call what I'm doing a Studio Ghibli film quest, and \"Princess Mononoke\" was an interesting item to mark off. But it's not a favorite of mine. The movie's certainly ambitious, once again tackling an ecological story and adding a sense of ambiguity; good-and-evil isn't so simple, and the real struggle is for a balance between industry and nature. My problem (and I speak solely for myself) is that I couldn't get \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" out of my head for most of this runtime. And I think that that film is entirely more potent with a well-defined heroine. Here, there's a split between Ashitaka, Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke, and even though the tone is definitely more adult (with the violence to match), the prior movie had the more effective characters. Is that fair? Maybe not, but again, it's just me. But like I said before, this is impressive on a technical level. 6/10"

    "Mushi-Shi": [
        "Mushishi is a strangely calming anime. It takes place in almost feudal Japan (they seem a lot more liberal and have access to some technology like microscopes and the mushishi talks about genetics in one episode) and follows Ginko, a man that can see the strange lifeforms that are all around us, called Mushi.In the end the episodes are rarely tense, with no or almost no violence. The mushi themselves are not perceived as evil that must be killed, but as a part of the ecosystem. Unlike most mushishi (a sort of mushi hunter/doctor), Ginko, the lead character, seeks only to restore the balance between normal life and mushi life.The anime itself takes place for only 26 episodes, all self contained, you could watch any of them in any order without losing any continuity. The manga is of course much longer and you can read it online.The calm music and the elements of traditional Japanese life and history are most welcome for a leisurely time when you want to relax and take your mind of things.",
        "As much as the anime had a good voice cast and the animation was pretty nice even for being a mid 2000's anime, it just didn't make me intrigued to keep watching it. I just thought the characters in this (not the actors) and the storyline were just dull. I know this is a weak review about it but I have nothing more to say...",
        "Mushishi is basically a ghost spirit story of the most unique kind. A man named Ginko travels Japan searching for the most interesting and original spirits that dwells in folk lore. During his trek he meets up with people who succumb to a spirit by accident or intended just by listening to their stories. For old tales like this I find it to be refreshing in every way. The movements of each character to the way eyes meet in the conviction of each person's mannerism.A plus is the music that matches each story. Light tinkles to heavy burden drums when the situation is needed. I found the layout of the Japanese countryside is breathtaking for its ability to match moods to each of the story tellers for Ginko to listen. Plights of despair or simply ill gotten scenarios for Ginko to figure out with his wooden back pack of medicine. Plus his lit cigarette to keep away spirits from him.Mushishi to me is back to the basics of simple stories with an acid edge of danger thrown in to those country folk that have no idea what a spirit does or why they exist. To them it's all part of the grand scheme of things for simple minds to not figure out in order to keep their quiet life balanced.To others like Ginko it is an opportunity to find the strange fascinating as well as keeping a safe distance to observe and not to construe too forward into the unknown world of spirits or ghosts. Mushishi is full of original and well kept stories for the mind to wander later on as if to say... 'What if?\" Excellent series, great music, and wonderful content for those who love a good ghost story. Highly recommended to all ages.",
        "Well this certainly was a different experience. Mushishi is a very episodic anime with each episode depicting a case or a problem or something related to the creatures known as Mushi, which are special creatures present everywhere but only a selected few can see them. And a Mushi master, our protagonist, goes in and tries to solve the problems. I really don't like episodic things but Mushishi somehow managed to make each 20 mins an interesting and beautiful tale, some better than other obviously. That is one hell of a task considering aside from our hero, there really are no recurring characters. There is a very unique beauty in this anime, regarding nature/life etc, which is more complemented by beautiful art and great soundtrack. If only it wasn't this much episodic, I most probably would have loved it way more. Still, really enjoyed it. 8.3/10",
        "I find Mushishi NOT to be boring but i view it as the MOST boring anime(but not sure if manga) ever. The sheer commitment to no service of any kind to the reader/viewer has to be admired ! There is only deep storytelling and the beauty of nature nothing more. The mangaka had a vision to tell and did't care about the reader one bit. Ether you get on the slowest train if all or you go home. A friend of mine i now forced to watch the series described it as gently walking through a forest. I couldn't describe it better. 10/10 and the best Mono no aware of all. The new Mushishi volume is identical to the two sisters episode 11 and 12(or special if you like) from season 2 by the way.",
        "It's one of the most beautiful anime i have come across, the water color style usage is very similar to what we see in Studio Ghibli movies, it goes perfectly well with the rich flora and fauna theme. The anime don't have a central plot instead each of the episodes focuses on the mysterious beings called Mushishi, these creatures are intriguing, creepy and beautiful at the same time. Each one of the episodes deals with super-natures beliefs and are very interesting. The episodes have hardly any dialogs instead relies on great background music,the whole style is so calming it actually makes me sleepy most of the time. Mind you it's not dull just very soothing. Whats the biggest plus point for the anime is the only negative it has - the extra calming effect, took me ages to finish the anime as i could never get myself to watch back to back, instead cherished each individual episode.",
        "\"Feeling myself so strongly seduced by both the light and the darkness is something that I never want to forget...\" - Yuki Urushibara, author of the Mushishi mangaThe Japanese anime series \"Mushishi\" has a very special place in my heart, so I wanted to dedicate several lines about it since a long time. But it took me a second look at the old series and a fresh first view of the new series to be able to get to the point of writing about it. And now I reconnect with the real idea behind the emotion which pushed me to explore this beautiful and emotional piece of Japanese animation. The true mystery of life is life itself. Something inexplicable, something controversial, but still engaging and profound. The Japanese folklore is truly an amazing source of bright inspiration for the author Yuki Urushibara. And we can clearly feel why.It is not important how we get it - it is interesting that no matter of our own level of perception, we all, the viewers understand emotionally every chapter, every episode of this journey through the people and their life between the darkness and the light. Each story is standing alone and is yet sufficient by itself. Each character doesn't need a prolonged back story. We see and hear and feel the sensation and connect to the human feelings presented to us. Mythological creatures called Mushi represent the eons old human beliefs. We as a species have always, are always and will always try to explain the world around us through something magical and inexplicable. Each and every event and experience in our lives (no matter how bright or dark it is) is perceived not through the sense, but via the heart and the soul. The imagery is so simple..., but yet it is enchanting. We as viewers do not know how, but we feel sympathy to the heroes in each story, because they live like us and have experience so similar to the real life that we simply accept through out hearts.And here we come to the conclusion that this both naturalistic and imaginary style of representing life is an elegant symbol of humanism. We all value the flow of life which sometimes really feels surrealistic. And this thought makes us feel more comfortable living it, doesn't it?",
        "Mushi-Shi (2005) from Japan is a brilliantly written and thought-provoking anime series, with lots of surprises in store for you if you are patient and open minded.With Mushi-Shi you will refreshingly NOT see your typical anime cutesy big-eyed girls having crushes on boys, shallow harem sex stories that get old fast, or violent, senseless samurai blood letting. Mushi-Shi is in a class by itself, a gentle show with class and poignancy. As the teachers used to tell us in school, \"You will need your thinking caps for this one.\" At first you think you are watching a series about a life force called \"mushi\", and a traveling man named Ginko who is studying them, but the episodes all have moral tales to teach that transcend the outline of the basic stories. Most episodes are really about the relationships between human beings. The mushi are really incidental and act as catalysts to the dynamics of personal relationships.For instance, in the incredible \"A String from the Sky\" episode the story isn't really about the mushi string that captures the girl, flinging her into the sky; the real lesson being taught is the essential trust that has to exist between a man and woman who claim to love each other. The relationship will not survive without that trust. In \"One Night Bridge\" the episode really isn't about a mushi bridge that appears once every twenty years; rather the story is about a love so powerful between a young girl and boy that even the experience of death cannot truly break the devotion of their relationship.There are also surprising touches of humor in the stories and the main character of Ginko, both of which help bring some levity to serious situations taking place in most of the episodes.I watched in both Japanese with English subtitles and then all over again in the English dub, and I ended up liking both equally. Also special mention should go to the beautiful music soundtrack, which was perfect for the series. If only all anime were of such superb quality! Each episode is basically a stand alone segment, with different characters interacting with Ginko, who is the traveling \"Mushi Master\" out to help them, if he can, extricate themselves from the mushi's influences.I rented the series from Netflix. Although the rating there is TV-14 I disagree with this completely. There is nothing in Mushi-Shi that children ten years of age or older couldn't watch. No sex, hardly any violence, the language is clean except for a \"damn\" once in a blue moon. Compared to most other anime out there Mushi-Shi is very clean.I have watched my share of anime series by now, but I could easily throw all the others out after watching Mushi-Shi. It's that phenomenal. It deserves its high rating on the IMDb. It is intelligent and boasts beautiful animation. Don't miss this wonderful series!",
        "Mushishi is does not have a linear plot, but I find that great as each episode holds a new wonder. Some of with are horrifying and others end up good. It feels very naturey but has sort of a paranormal spin to it ending up with the this. The anime is interesting and unique and I'd recommend it.",
        "Every episode of this anime make me feel thrill. 1) Because of the Graphics 2) Because of the mystery about the main character 3) Because of the sound effectsIf you love a Great graphics in anime I recommend this anime to watchThis anime is full of trivia for Example: About the pillow. Because of this anime I learned the meaning of pillow.By the way I am praising to the people who makes this anime and manga. because of the effort.Don't get me wrong this is one of the best anime when it comes in Graphics.The setting is very vivid and clear. It's like real. And in addition per episode of this anime has a unique story",
        "\"Mushi-Shi\" is a Great show, really this show provides very little insight into anything. If you love a beautiful graphics and great soundtrack in anime I recommend this Mushi-Shi anime to watch, I've ever seen like this!!! If you haven't seen it yet, do it now... because it is wonderfully written and well-thought.",
        "If you're looking for an anime with quick-paced action and loads of screaming and fan-service, look elsewhere. If you seek an engrossing anime with meaning and a certain \"sentimental\" charm, Mushishi is the deal. While there's nothing totally wrong with the former type of anime, Mushishi really sets itself apart from the others - with a very melodic and abrupt opening, calm atmosphere and music throughout the show, as well as minimal dialogue that is quite monotone.The story is a very interesting one that explores the world inhabited by creatures dubbed \"Mushi\", which surround us and are much more complex than any standard organism. We are introduced to an enigmatic man nicknamed \"Ginko\", who is a self-proclaimed \"Mushi master\" and seems to possess a considerable understanding of these perplexing creatures. Each episode is standalone and the series does not have any discernible ending, but this is a huge part of the charm of the series and that allows it to be easily picked up from any point. In each episode, Ginko meets individuals who have been affected by the Mushi in some way.The dub is surprisingly great and lacks the melodramatic and over-the-top voice acting that other anime tend to have, so I would definitely recommend it just as much as the original. This is a great watch for viewers of virtually any age. What's more? It's great for stress and insomnia.",
        "With High Ratings on both sites like MAL and IMDB, you would expect at least something to get from this show but alas, there is nothing.Watching Mushishi is like staring into the abyss. If you wanna be episodic, at least make every episode somewhat interesting or intriguing in some way. Mushishi doesn't want to do that. At least more than half of its episodes feel the exact same. The stories are too similar and formulaic, so you'll feel at times like you've already watched some of these episodes, despite it being your first time viewing them.And it's so repetitive that it induces you of extreme boredom, not because there isn't enough action or fanservice or whatever. It's because every episode with few exceptions is the exact same.This could be excusable had we been given interesting characters or themes. But alas Mushishi doesn't even want to do that. The most interesting episode is Episode 21 because it actually presents us with a Moral Dilemma, but it happens to be the only episode where this is done. Most of these episodes deal with conflicts that are one dimensional and uninteresting.The side-characters are given these problems that then Ginko has to come and solve, but the biggest problem is that these side-characters are irrelevant by the next episode and so there is no meaningful progression and it feels like a waste of time. And this wouldn't even be a Problem if they impacted the Main Character: Ginko in some way, but they don't.If only the main character learned something from these experiences, I would find it interesting, but alas, he learns absolutely nothing. He is completely static and doesn't develop. Not only that, he doesn't even have an interesting motivation for his actions or for being a Mushi-Master. He just does it because of plot-convenience. (Lol, he attracts Mushi, so he can't stay in one place for long) - that's it.That's the only reason we are ever given. We don't even get any meaningful introspection on how this kind of life makes him feel, he has no thoughts on it. It's left completely irrelevant. Even the backstory of Ginko only explains his character design and explains his attraction to Mushi. But that's it. He doesn't even care to learn about his Past or find out who he was before or question if it even matters. It's a complete after-thought. None of these Ideas are ever explored.So Mushishi suffers from a boring protagonist who can't keep this show interesting, a concept that is rarely explored beyond surface level. Multiple side characters that feel the exact same and have the same range of boring personalities. Episodes that are formulaic and rarely written with any creativity.It makes one wonder.Why should I give a damn about this show? It has decent artstyle and backgrounds, but that's it. That's so superficial and stupid. And it's not even like groundbreaking in Animation, the majority of it is just Average at Best. It's not reason enough to like something.It doesn't present you with any interesting themes to think about, nor does it give you a good cast of characters and neither does it give you a meaningful story. What is there to like?So I end this Review with this Question. To all of you who like Mushishi, do you feel intelligent? You like a show that is about as shallow as any other fan-pandering action TV show but without the action or fanservice? Does that make you feel intelligent? The simple answer is that: It shouldn't.",
        "Mushi-shi is a captivating entity in the realm of anime that shows that slow-paced films can be absolutely fantastic if you do everything just right.With fantastic visuals presented by a lesser known anime company ARTLAND, the world of the mushi-shi is brought to life with a truly intellectual perception and drive the contents of its unusual mystery to a level of great integrity and appreciation.Mushi-shi is smart, well-written and interesting to watch, succumbing its viewer with the profound elegance that the mushi-shi are, neither human nor plant, they are life in its purest form and as the world will go on, we will one day discover that the cure lies in the curse.",
        "A mind-blowing, and beautiful anime series. Not very typical in terms of what most would expect from an anime, yet it has proved itself to be a masterpiece nonetheless. The pacing is slow, and there isn't a lot of action, yet it turns out to be very gripping and suspenseful nonetheless.Story: Episodic, without any type of overall link between the different encounters of the protagonist other than the protagonist himself and the occasional explanations about some of the phenomenon throughout the show (and some characters). Yet, each and ever episode contains its own individual story that all prove to be very gripping, and often somber. Each episode presents different characters from all around the regions Ginko travels to, and each has their own issue that is Mushi-related. Many of these stories are somewhat uplifting, yet often times very tragic and thought-provoking. The layout isn't one that I would usually be in to, yet it proves to work masterfully so. The many twists and turns the episodes take leave the viewer at the edge of their seat and constantly engaged even if the show isn't super fast-paced and action-packed.Art: The artwork is often very beautiful. The scenery is amazing and certain sequences just look incredible. Many of the human characters are hard to distinguish at times, so there is less emphasis on human faces and more so on the surroundings and Mushi. Which ultimately ends up looking good nevertheless.Sound: Good usage of sound. Lovely intro and outro music, very somber and alluring. The voice acting was very suiting for all the characters. The sound ultimately creates the type of atmosphere the show would intend for with each given situation.Character: Ginko is an amazing protagonist. A very mysterious and intelligent wanderer that truly shows how much he values life and learning. He isn't infallible, yet overcomes many obstacles with a realistic approach that doesn't leave the viewer with a huge sense of disbelief. The pragmatic ways he approaches each obstacle makes him a lot more enjoyable, and the way he perceives the world and challenges around him are at many times very compelling. Well-written character with quite a bit of depth. The other characters introduced can be very brash, other times tragic, or many other things across the spectrum which works well for each of the scenarios and situations in each episode. Most of them are also very compelling in their circumstance and have a lot to offer for the message that the episode in question is trying to convey.Enjoyment: For me, it was hugely enjoyable. Very thought-provoking and beautiful. The pacing was wonderful. I didn't find myself counting down the minutes before each episode was finished because of how engaging the show can be. Many of the episodes had me dwell on them for a good time afterwards. There are many moments that are hugely emotional, and many that are quite philosophical.Overall: Fantastic and outstanding show. A masterpiece. Wonderfully written and well-thought. A true gem in the anime world, as well as the world of entertainment in general. Whether a fan of anime or not, one could find so many reasons to adore this series and be captivated by it.",
        "Mushi-Shi is by far one of my favorite animes. It follows Ginko the mushi master who travels between villages and helps people with mushi problems wherever he goes. In each episode he encounters new characters and their mushi problems. Each episode is a self contained story that rarely is ever mentioned again. The lack of an over-arching plot should be bothersome, but somehow Mushi-Shi makes it work. By avoiding a season-long quest and plot, Mushi-Shi invests itself fully into each episode. This creates more focus on the plot and characters unique to each episode, and ultimately makes each episode extremely satisfying to watch (most likely because the audience doesn't have to worry about saving the world or some other sort of season-long quest in the back of their minds).Besides Ginko, other characters rarely reappear. Despite this, Mushi-Shi manages to makes memorable and compelling characters. The way the show treats its female characters is especially notable. The female characters are never sexualized, pushed out of the action, or poorly characterized. They get the same treatment as the male characters. Mushi-Shi always makes sure to explain enough about its characters for them to feel realistic in their situations, but always holds back enough information to keep a mysterious tone.The soundtrack for Mushi-Shi is perfect. It feels calm, mysterious, and chilling all at once to fit with the strange situations Ginko faces. It contributes a lot to this anime's unique feel.Though Mushi-Shi may feel a bit slow compared to other popular animes, it has a way of sucking you into Ginko's strange mushi-filled world. I found it a refreshing change of pace and an enjoyable adventure.",
        "What can I say about a show like Mushishi? All you really need to know is if you want a calm/serene experience with some of the most beautiful pieces of music anime has to offer then this show is made for you. If, like me, you are tired of the character tropes most anime use these days, then Mushishi will be a breath of fresh air because every character here acts like a normal human being. The best compliment I can give Mushishi is that it is like a nature documentary that you will never forget.",
        "Well, it's not exactly a nature experience since it's a TV-series. But the thing is that mushishi puts all its' force in depicting beautiful Asian scenery full of life. And at the core of that life are the 'Mushi'.Mushi are not animals, and they are not plants. Mushi are closer to life than anything else on the earth. And those who gathers lore about the mushi and knows how to treat them are the mushishi.I actually got the feeling of watching a horror movie when i saw this, the only thing was that there was no horror. Still, the mood was there, but in a kind and gentle way.The series follows a mushishi named Ginko and his travels and missions in the land. Human emotion is put aside as a theme, and love is more a fact than something that involves you in the story. I don't know if this is something coming from the authors own view of life, but it makes room for a feature where nature is the emotional basis, and it stands strong on the feelings that you get from marvels that lie within the silent whisper of the wind among trees.You encounter characters that all are affected by these mushi. The first one is a boy who can draw anything with his right hand and it springs to life, another one is a man chasing after a rainbow and even a human that is born from a seed. Many of the stories are built on things we notice in nature around us but find it hard to explain, like shooting stars, the end of the rainbow and the fact that a third of your soul remains within your pillow when you leave bed as it is where all your dreams live.The series moves in a slow gentle pace, where the music never gets too eager and nothing ever gets too exciting in manners of rush or panic. It might somehow even be sleep inducing, but in a good way, like the swaying of the trees or a cold snowy night where everything is silent but the sparkling fireplace.Of course, it's up to anyone to have their own thoughts about it, but I think that the series wants to tell us that there is more to life than just being human. If you look around you, and look where there are no cars and high buildings, you'll notice lots of life that fills you up and effects you in ways you never think of. There is beauty in more than just you and me.I was expecting to find some sort of greater story that would unfold towards the end of the series, but that never came. May happen the stories got more dramatic towards the end, but they never stopped being told in the same way as always. There was never any certain resolution to the series, only the soft mushishi music with its' hypnotical drums, and when you had watched the last episode you knew that everything in the world of the mushi would keep on going as it had ever done before. I never got the feeling of saying goodbye to characters i'd miss, but was happy to have been able to come along on the journeys in this world so full of life and wonders.",
        "I was in search for an anime that was finished and was short that is when I stumbled across this spectacular anime.This anime comprises of 26 episodes each stands alone from the other. Ginko the Mushi-shi travels around japan encountering Mushis. Mushis are creatures that are neither animals or souls, they are living things between them. Not everyone can see them, Ginko and a few others can see them. Mushis can be good and could be bad. Ginko helps people who are facing problems with Mushis.Every encounter Ginko makes with a mushi is breathtakingly fascinating. I suggested this anime to a couple of my friends and they all asked me \"It doesn't have a story-line as such. does it? Then how is it fun?\"I can only tell you that if you don't watch this you are just going to miss a great amount of fun. Every time I watched one episode I would be persuaded to watch another and then another. The art is extraordinary, music is spectacular, and the stories is just Brilliant. Its not just about the Mushis or the Mushi-shis, Its about Human emotions and love.A must watch anime. If you decide not to see this you just missed \"Serenity\"!My rating : 9/10",
        "For all those who are shaking down anime to see what it has to offer, you won't find much better than Mushi-Shi. This anime will change the way you see the world and interact with people and nature in day to day life - it is that powerful. For the reviews that state this anime was dull, all I can say is: 'some people can see Mushi, and some people cannot, you are those unfortunate people who cannot'....What a beautiful inspirational piece of art. Thanks, Ginko.",
        "I am so thankful to have found Mushishi. The storytelling in each episode is masterfully thoughtful, creative and calm. The series isn't flashy, nor does it grab for your attention with action and fighting (don't get me wrong, I love a good anime battle just as much as anyone else), However, despite its simplicity, I find each story deeply thoughtful, containing themes which urge viewers to slow down and really think deliberately. In short, I would recommend this anime to anyone and everyone.",
        "describing the meaning of mushi-s without emerging some false ezoteric- extraterrestial blabla is almost impossible, probably thats why this masterpiece of anime remained quite unknown. each episode is a different hymn of life. amazingly visualized, breathtaking beauty of life, as it flows mysteriously and appear in different manifestation, like animals, plants, and mushis creating a wonderful and complex ecology. a scratch on the balance of lifeforms symbiosis results strange, unusual phenomenons, that can be cured by the Mushi-shi, a kind of para-doctor who is destined to smoke (thc) in order to keep mushis away from himself. and the atmosphere! it just picks you up from the world around for 23 minutes, and shows some real values using the average, common people to show the greatness of humans, and mushis, and above all: life. cheesy, cheesy, but if you watch, you wont have other options than agree:)",
        "Being a huge fan of Anime i was looking for a really interesting anime to watch. i stumbled upon Mushi-shi on amazon and bought the set for reasonable price. I could not have been happier with the result. Mushi-shi is one of my now all time favourite anime series. It's only flaw is that there is not enough of it! The stories portrayed in the series are heartwarming, creepy or just plain intriguing. It kept me going back to the DVD player every day just to see the next episode. The animation and audio is all very stunning and adds a tranquil feel to it. Mushi-shi is a pure jewel and also emits all the right messages about nature and life. Anyone looking for a gripping anime with great stories. Watch Musih-shi!",
        "I absolutely love this :) it leaves you feeling the same way some Studio Ghibli does. It's gentle and full of wonder, yet a little dark in places but beautifully spiritual. I love the artwork, the landscapes etc. really nice.I totally recommend it.",
        "The stories pull you in with their calm sounds and imagery, but there is a sense of something unsettling just beneath the surface. It makes you feel like you've been in the forest. It's been a while since I've seen it, and I keep searching for it after it was taken off Netflix. So it has stuck with me, in a good way. Watch this when you're feeling disconnected from nature, or anytime to enjoy the art of this creation."

    "Fate/Zero": [
        "I'm glad to have watch this anime finally like I'm so impressed with Ufotable's \"Demon Slayer\" with its fantastic sub casts, characters, art graphics, fighting scenes, storylines, you name it! So why wouldn't I be impressed with Fate\\Zero too?!Honestly man, the fight scenes in this are pretty dope if you ask me. The best fight I've seen in this prequel show was when Saber and Kiritsugu fought together first. Even hearing Kari Wahlgren and Matthew Mercer's voices were just 10 thumps up from me, both are just great voice actors!I really wish the whole thing was a movie rather than having it at 13 episodes because I find it would benefit better. Although it didn't bother me since I just admired the whole thing as a distraction from that frustration. Guess I gotta watch season 2 and see the original in that case when I get the chance.Definitely check this anime out squad!",
        "So after the mixed critiqued Fate/Stay Night series by studio dean. A brand new studio decided to restart the franchise and this time from the very beginning.War for the Holy Grail - Pursuing the power of the \"Holy Grail\" which grants a miracle, this is a contest in which seven mages summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete for it. In the battle whose conclusion was postponed three times, now, the fourth war commences. Amongst the mages, there was a man who was always alone, and could not find out the meaning behind his life. His name was Kirei Kotomine. Not comprehending the guidance of fate, Kirei was lost, and had kept questioning why someone like him was given the Command Seals. However, a nemesis crossed Kirei's path. That person is - Kiritsugu Emiya. A merciless mage killer and assassin-for-hire who sought the miracle of the Holy Grail on behalf of his wife's family - the Einzberns. Merely recited in fragments in Fate/stay night, this is the Fourth Holy Grail War that took place 10 years prior. The truth that unfolded behind the battle between Shirou's foster father, Rin's father, and the younger Kirei Kotomine, is finally revealed.I will admit this was a very nice restart for the fate franchises and this time we get a lot more character depth and background on both Kieri Kotominae and Kiritsu Emiya as well as how the whole holy grail war began.",
        "Rating: 7.8Favorite Episode: The End of HonorIt was simultaneously good and underwhelming. It removed too much content from the LN that would've added the necessary characterization/explanations to make the deaths hit harder. There was tons of shock value but since they sped run the characters it didn't matter when they died because I felt nothing. Ex: we met Shirley for one episode then she died, we also met Natalia for 2 episodes then she died etc...There wasn't enough time to flesh them out and get me attached to them. This needed more episodes to give us those inner monologues and backgrounds that make the characters more potent. Good not great.You're supposed to read the main 3 routes in the VN before watching this so this limits the suprise factor as well.",
        "Fate/Zero is a show that I found absolutely no problems in. The Story is fantastic and engaging, while the characters are complex and enjoyable to watch. Animation and colors pop and make everything look visually stunning through a nice blend of hand drawn animation and CGI. Philosophies are at stake during battles which gives them so much more weight. Verbal encounters between characters hold so much over the story as well, as the manipulation in this show is just as important as the fighting. Even the music is used perfectly in this show, beautifully representing the crucial moments that it's used in. I wasn't expecting Fate/Zero to be in my Top 5 anime, but I found myself pleasantly surprised.",
        "I really liked the concept of this Anime and the storyline and i would have gave it a 10/10 if not for its sometimes confusing objectives of certain competitors.Even the ending was confusing and didnt seem logical to me and the big reveal was very flawed u might say.But regardless This anime has amazing action, storyline. Creativity, wonderful characters and most of all its for a mature audience so its even more enjoyable.",
        "Being a prequel to Fate/Stay night, which I happen to really like, it was a great experience to see what happened in the events mentioned a lot in Fate/stay night. Fate zero is serious, brutal, unapologetic and mature. It is a character driven and dialogue heavy anime. Story is good. I like the whole holy grail war scenario and the idea of using past great heroes to fight in them. Storytelling is AWESOME. There are lots and lots of characters in this anime and it manages to give everyone a fair share of screen time and great character development. Each character is complex, varied and distinct. This is where this anime truly shines. The relationship between the Masters and the servants is great and is distinct as well. Some are easy, some are complex, some are downright weird. The dialogue in it is also really great, and there is a lot of it. Every movie a character makes is a calculated one. There are no pointless fights or stupid decisions. It really goes to show how mature this anime is. The protagonist especially, is really clever and plans out everything with perfection. It, at times, gives Baccano and Death note a run for their money. There is some humour in this anime, although all of it comes from Rider and his master's conversations and scenes. The way they handled them was one of my favourite things in the anime, loved it. Animations/art is without a doubt the best I have seen so far in an anime series. Everything is so detailed, beautiful and fluid. There is a lot of CGI too. Normally, I hate CGI in animes but here, they managed to blend it almost perfectly. On very few occasions did it felt out of place. Watching this anime in HD really just melt your eyes, ITS SO PRETTY!!Soundtrack is amazing as well. From epic battle music too moving sad moments, it has it all. The anime is not perfect however. I really wished there were some more dialogue moments between Saber and Kritsigu other than that one epic one. Would have loved if there was more development between them. Also, there aren't many fight scenes in this anime. I get the reason behind it as its a more mature anime, pointless fighting was not gonna be in it. But still, epic ones are few and far between. Would have loved to see some of the characters go all out against one another especially in the quality of its animation. Overall, it is a great, epic anime which you don't get to see a lot. Its maturity is what sets it apart from other animes like it. It is certainly one of the best anime I have seen in a while and perhaps of all time. Compared to FS, FZ is way way better. Fate/Stay night is like a younger, annoying, often playful brother. Fate Zero is the older, serious, mature, awesome and somewhat dark brother. Highly recommended. 9.5/10",
        "Fate/Zero is my first foray into the Fate franchise. I've heard many good things about both this and the 'stay night' installments of this series, and I have to agree that Fate/Zero is excellent entertainment.Fate/Zero is set in the city of Fuyuki, Japan in the modern era (the ~1990s would be my guess), though unknown to the wider populace, magic exists. The premise of the series is that the Holy Grail War is fought between seven mages (\"masters\") and their mythological heroes (\"servants\") to claim said grail, which can grant any wish.At the beginning, I felt this setup was a bit too complicated. I had my problems keeping track of all seven (interwoven but still discrete) story lines with, at a minimum, two characters each. After a few episodes, that problem passed, however. Indeed, most of the characters are so unique and likeable that it's easy to tell them apart (though two or three of them certainly fall to the wayside).Indeed, the characters are one of the greatest strengths of the series. They are well-crafted and multidimensional, and even the evil psychopaths have their likeable qualities.Another strength is the intricately woven plot, especially in some story arcs. After a somewhat slow start, encumbered by having to introduce all the characters, the series quickly gains momentum. There are few episodes I'd consider fillers, especially in the later half of the first season. Generally, I'd say that the second season is better than the first by a fair margin, though there is no real separation between the two; the transition between them is seamless without any notable season finale. Two episodes in the middle of the second season explore the backstory of one of the main characters; while I'd consider these episodes among the best of the entire series, the sudden change in themes and setting is a bit jarring. The overall series finale is excellent, though I felt like the very final episode was not quite as bombastic as its predecessors.Another great strength of Fate/Zero is its production value, especially the animation. I can't think of any other anime as gorgeous as this one, even though Fate/Zero is now more than ten years old. The lighting especially is stunning. The soundtrack, while solid, is not Yuki Kajiura's best work. Again, I felt like the second season was much better than the first, but there are far fewer catchy motifs than in, for example, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. The direction, sound effects, and (English) voice actors are all top-notch, however.My biggest gripe is that I felt like a certain spark was missing. With some series like Evangelion, PMMM, Elfen Lied, Planetes, etc., there is just something special and engaging. Fate/Zero, while excellent in its own right, was lacking that certain spark. Perhaps the series just had so many characters that it was difficult to properly connect to them. I have to admit that while most of the characters are very much likeable, none of them would make it into the list of my all-time favourite characters. I'm sure that's highly subjective, however.All in all, Fate/Zero is a great show that I can easily recommend. I plan to watch Fate/stay night (Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel) in the near future as well; if they're equally promising, I'm sure it'll be time well enjoyed.",
        "Brilliant artwork, and loving the non-standard story arcs.Kiritsugu is a great character, to the point where this would be a much better series if it just followed him. As is, his Shirley and Natalya episodes could be combined into a compelling OVA.Honestly annoyed with Saber. Lots of great potential, but so much of her development occurs via exposition. Someone compliments her now or for what she did in the past without any real details on what that was. Then she rather accepts the whole \"just a little girl\" bit, when it was the perfect opportunity to really explain what kingship is.Was worried when the Grail selected Caster, despite his obviously chaotic evil alignment. Glad it finally tied to the Grail's complete lack of moral agency in the conclusion.One rather large plot hole - the Grail not granting wishes beyond the recipients explicit understanding. In merely selecting competitors, the Grail demonstrates intricate knowledge of the world. So the peaceful wish is denied, but an Armageddon-level wish is interpreted in surprising fashion?Why is Rider's arc closed in such trivial fashion? Second favorite character with so much personality, and then essentially written off to shift focus to the anti-hero?And why does Kiritsugu need to kill his family? I know his ethical dilemma is killing a few to save many, but this turn just feels incredibly contrived.Followed the whole thing since there's so many rave reviews, but this won't even make my top 10. Unsure if I'll even bother with Fate Stay Night now.",
        "What a great action anime it was. The storyline and action is amazing.",
        "No way.At first episode I was going to throw up, I dropped watching just a bit later in the series. One scene is enough, it is not spoiler but who watched knows perfectly which scene I am speaking about.Unacceptable even for adults of any age.",
        "This review is covering the entire Fate/Zero series(25episodes).Before i watched this series someone had called it \"the Game Of Thrones(GoT) of anime\", now i didn't understand because i never watched GoT before. So as i was putting off watching this anime for a few months. I ended up watching all 4 current seasons of GoT and upon finishing that i decided to watch Fate/Zero. After having seen both i agree completely, this IS the GoT of anime. This show was an \"decent or alright\" anime in the first 12 episodes and for me \"decent or alright\" means i could keep watching or if i stopped right now i wouldn't feel an unfinished urge to watch more. After the first 12 or 13 episodes, this show went from my average list to one of my top 8! Now don't get me wrong it was still an above average anime from the get go but for me it just wasn't pulling me in for more after the end of every episode, but that changed real fast after i started the second half.If you like old hero's and legendary warriors brought into the modern day age (with magic!) to all fight each other to see who is superior in the name of the holy grail(!) then you will enjoy this show! Now maybe you don't really care for old legends and warriors(like myself) but you wanna see bloody violence with a taste of real life hit-men and a hint of badass magic then you should really give this show a try and i can guarantee you'll enjoy this show. 5/5, 9.5/10. Why? The storyline and plot is very solid. The animation is flawlessly beautiful. The music is very well picked. English dub is amazing. All of the characters are very developed. Through and through i have to say this isn't my favorite but in terms of things that make or break a show i can't name a single \"flaw\" with this show. My only \"complaint\", not really a complaint as the ending was amazingly done, but i am saddened by the ending, it wasn't how i thought it would end. And you should know that there is a sequel to this called \"Fate/Stay Night\" where it picks up where this series ended.",
        "Overall this was a pretty awesome series.There were about 4 episodes that I could have done without, the first one was supposed to introduce everybody but was just a bunch of dudes talking. There was one that followed an irrelevant little girl and 2 flashback episodes that went no where.It felt a bit weird at times, as the main characters fade into the background a little too often. Instead the majority of it is spent with Rider and his master, which I loved. Aside from that the best bit of this was servants interacting with each other, Saber was a bit preachy at times, which is funny as they're all warriors from the past whole have slaughter thousands of people. The \"villain\" was pretty interesting, again you can't really call him that because all the people taking part in the grail are out to kill each other, so no ones really the good guy. The person who seemed the most promising and actually gave you something to root for, basically disappeared for the majority of this.So yeah pretty good, would recommend watching this before Unlimited Blade works as it spoils this one.",
        "Really good anime series so far. Soon gets going after a couple of eps. Definitely worth a watch if you're looking for a little more adult action blood etc. Lobe the characters and animation is top notch.",
        "One day I was just looking for a highly rated anime on Netflix and came across this so I gave it a shot and watched the whole way through.First of all I love the premise: It's an excuse to have a bunch of interesting characters from history fight to the death, all controlled by human handlers. All the masters and servants have their own interesting personalities and motivations. Okay, there are a few humans who are mostly stoic low talkers but overall the characters are really diverse. The animation also seems really good and up to date. I love how well-drawn, colorful anime looks on an HD TV.My only thing is the storytelling could've been much better here I think. You've got a great cast of characters and a cool concept right off the bat, but I'm not sure it was executed as well as it could've been. There's just not enough screen time for all those interesting characters. Many of them don't get fleshed out nearly enough and a handful could even be considered flat characters because we only learn as much about them as the plot demands.Not necessarily a big negative, but I thought the pacing was strange as well. There is a one on one fight pretty early on, so you assume things are going to move fast, but after that it's mostly the human masters scheming or servants talking a lot but never actually getting to the point where they throw down with each other. On the flip side this results in the show being deeper than just a bunch of fight scenes.Another complaint would be some plot devices introduced out of nowhere. There are two or three times where you'll be thinking \"Wait, what's this now? No one mentioned it before.\" Somewhat related is the fact that they're not really clear on how this all works. Of course magic isn't real so it's hard to quantify it, but I had absolutely no idea why certain characters were more feared than others, and definitely no idea how strong their \"super moves\" actually were. Some rules of the contest that are established eventually end up being ignored, forgotten about, or are violated with no repercussions. It's almost like the rules are a gentleman's agreement, but you don't REALLY have to follow them. That's fine if that's the case but they never really say that.Overall it's a fun show though, and over the course of 26 episodes none of these complaints crop up too consistently. There's a lot of meat here and getting into some more back stories for the characters could have definitely resulted in at least one more season or even two. The show could've used more actual fighting too in my opinion but regardless you're still intrigued the whole time about who will emerge victorious. I hate to say I think it's a bit overrated, but you should check it out anyways. Just expect to be in it for the long haul to get the most out of it, and for some episodes to be far better than others.",
        "Story-line => 5/5 (The storyline is very interesting and had many twists.);\nActing => 5/5 (The voice acting is up to the mark. I particularly loved Kotomine's voice acting. It was so synced with the character. );\nDirecting => 5/5 (Overall presentation was amazing and thrilling to watch.);\nAnimation => 5/5 (The animation is a treat to the eyes. UFOTABLE for the win.);\nScreenplay => 5/5 (The characters were very relatable since the background study was very clear. The dialogue between the characters were also relatable.);\nPersonal Recommendation => 5/5 (If you want to get into Fate Lore, start with this. You can also enjoy it as a standalone series. Great watch. Don't watch Fate SN UBW before watching this.);\nMost Favorite Character => Iskander(Most heartwarming and honorable character of the whole series. I was a bit confused between Kiritsugu and Iskander. But considering all aspects, Iskander is my favorite. His views gave me some food for thought. );Overall Personal Rating => 10/10",
        "If anyone tries to understand fate series story, don't try so hard to get it. Still plot was good. But Just enjoy the action scenes, it was just lit\ud83d\udd25. Yeah I came here for some lighting action.",
        "Really enjoyed many aspects of this show, and grateful to the hard working people who put it together a decade ago. I'm just super stingy with my ratings ;).It takes maybe a few episodes to get used to the ensemble cast, but once you do it is quite immersive. Great character development, unique setting, even the music was surprisingly good. It's very plot focused and has few if any filler episodes.The theme of the show is pretty heavy, and it has clever world building that gets revealed little by little, which is a great part of the experience. It has some very dark philosophical themes related to nihilism and I certainly wouldn't recommend it for children. But it is thought provoking journey into moral questions associated with power and heroism, even if you don't ultimately like where the show goes with those questions it's excellent food for thought.So again, thanks for your hard work to everyone who built this show. I enjoyed it!",
        "You could watch this anime and never hear of the original Fate/stay night which is a beauty. It pretty much sums everything up in the first episode, it's long and might bore you but it will pay off to understand the rest of the series. If you're into historical subjects then you will enjoy it, however, they do twist it up a bit (not the reason why it's a 8 by the way) Absolutely amazing writing, alike with another anime: Attack On Titan (and all the fangirls flip their shizz) it is very dark, maybe even a bit darker. Unlike AOT it does have lighthearted moments, not many but a few. The characters are also nicely detailed, the fight scenes are great and you fall in love with the characters. Fate/Zero does stay fray of the traditional animes however, it's more realistic than some I've seen. In all honestly, it would be cool to see this as a live action. It is such a great set up for its remake of Fate/stay night.",
        "Hear my review.With the promise of granting any wish, the omnipotent Holy Grail triggered three wars in the past, each too cruel and fierce to leave a victor. Being the prequel of the well known franchise Fate/Stay Night, Fate/zero certainly captured the attention of many very easily. What is immediately clear about this production though is not only does it match its predecessor, it far surpasses it in every way imaginable. Whether it be the directing, visuals, character exposition, or anything you can possibly think of, Fate/zero manages to move into a class of its own. In the end, this all adds up to a much more complex and interesting tale, which one will certainly not be soon to forget.An interesting note about the cast in Fate/Zero though is that it mostly consists of older men. This is particularly noteworthy because so few anime today dare to make a cast of older men. It showcases just how a story with older cast members, even if they are men, can be quite entertaining and that perhaps the same old tired formulas do not always need to be employed to reach certain audiences. A story does not always have to be about high school kids, and hopefully this show can set an example of that\nBackground\nFate/Zero was simulcasted around the world, with subtitles covering eight major languages. It is currently licensed by Aniplex of America for release in North America.",
        "Fate Zero is not just a regular anime it's a pure piece of art, the animation is literally the greatest animation I've ever seen in my entire life! The music is so amazing that you'll never stop listening to it! The characters are so well written that you'll never stop thinking about them! Every little thing in this anime is just so beautiful, amazing, magnificent, gorgeous, stunning and very very well made! My favorite character is definitely \"Kiritsugu\", and not just in the Fate Zero Series but in the whole universe of \"The Fate Series\". What makes me love and appreciate him so much is his will to always take care of others before even taking care of himself, and his will to change the world and make it a better place for other people. His backstory literally made me cry, his life was always so hard to live, he lost too much to the moment he could not take it anymore, but still took care of other people and was always trying to be a hero. Even though what he did in the end of Fate Zero was... I don't really wanna talk about it here, you should just go and watch the anime for yourself. Oh and another thing I like about \"Kiritsugu\" is that he will always do anything to complete his objective no matter what, even things that no one has the guts to do.",
        "Manga / Anime has a tendency to add layers to the plot (One Piece probably being the best example of it), but it sometimes lack in character development (one of the good things that US based series can provide). Even if they do sometimes give you backstory of a character, there sometimes is a lack of the portrayal of the resultant emotion.Urobuchi is different. So is Fate / Zero.The protagonist is a good looking version of Rorschach, except with access to mythology. The characters understand politics, philosophy, and has a consequentialist approach to life, and therefore also show how differences in interpretation leads to different meaning of what is good and what is just. And the seriousness combines with epic battles between mythological heroes creates a story that is both enticing and thought inducing in equal measure.Despite this being a prequel to fate / stay night and its countless other sequels / narrations, this is the best of the whole lot without a shadow of a doubt. And in some way, it kind of shows how the Japanese romanticise nihilism, probably being the only country in the world that have being nuked.",
        "I don't give a lot of anime's a mental 8 or 9/10 for no reason. This anime is definitely worth a watch, or at least a check-out.\nAs always, I'm gonna start off with all the stuff that aren't that good:\nsome characters were made to be hated, and literally nothing else. explanation: Kayneth is one of the few characters in the series without a reason to be such a dickweed. I get it, he wants to get the holy grail and all that good stuff for his family's honor or whatever, but ... god, i feel bad for his wife.some things just don't add up! this is supposed to be a prequel, and yet 90% of everything that leaves you \"???\" isn't explained until the less-good, and honestly...quite /bad/ F/Stay Night: UBW which would come in two years.it's grossly UNDERrated. Help me out here you guys.Some interactions and phrases said by the english actors are awkward and kind of out-of-place (see also, the first time Gilgamesh uses the word \"cur\" toward berzerker. It's a bit awkward and he pauses, right? I'm not the only one...RIGHT?)seriously. some of these characters are such DICKWEEDS with no redeeming features (see also: kayneth and zouken.)the second season is quickly paced and the conflict is \"resolved\" within the final two episodes. the series somewhat rushes everyones deaths. its as if it was like \"oh crap! we're running out of money and episodes! uhh (x) dies here and then like 3 episodes later before anyone can recover... (y) will die and make everryone die as well! and then (y) will die 2 episodes later, lol!\"that was fun to type, time for the redeeming pieces!\nthe animations is /gorgeous/. drop. dead. /gorgeous/.both of its openings and endings are meaningful and just simply BEAUTIFUL.the bgm is also quite amazing! you can catch me jamming out to \"let the stars fall down\" or \"the battle is to the brave\"all of the battle scenes are simply badass. amazingly beautiful. most of the characters are well-rounded and besides being, of course, animated - REALISTIC. the english dub is an absolute gem. thank the lord for George Grant's voice. (no, im not biased! ok maybe a little.)",
        "This show is guaranteed to have something you'll like. There's so many great characters with their own set of morals, beliefs and desires that it's impossible not to identify with at least one. But it does have one flaw: the ending. Fate/Zero is a prequel but feels like a stand alone series that you'd assume to have a satisfying conclusion to wrap up all loose ends. However, the ending feels like it's just thrown in as an excuse to set the story up for Fate/Stay Night. And Stay Night is an average show at best - with all the clich\u00e9s like teenage heroes and token girls (one of Zero's strongest and most interesting female leads, Saber, basically becomes just one of many token love interest for the main character in Stay Night). As long as you can handle a less than satisfying ending, Fate/Zero is an amazing show that doesn't do what you expect - which probably stems from the fact that it's a prequel and the writers got all the clich\u00e9 overused plot devices out of their system. The main focus of the story doesn't rely on the epic battles, but rather the build up to these battles; the plans and preparations made, spying on the other Masters and Servants, discovering the motives of each character, the backroom deals made to further each Master's advance. It's basically a deconstruction of the Master/Servant Battle Royal formula (commonly seen in shows like Pok'e'mon, Digimon, Yu'gi'oh, etc.), and with adults.",
        "Fate/zero is about a magus who was the victim of a apocalypse, with only him and a woman left. After that, he starts killing the bad people of society, and so on. He comes to the holy grail just for one wish that he would work so hard to get. To stop world wars, crimes, and all other things. Later in the story, it is shown that the grail was just a trick all along, and it just floods the whole city. THIS SHOW IS AMAZING. With the perfect animation from ufotable, from the god tier songs/OST, and the plot setting, character development and the backstories. This is why I love fate/zero. It perfectly executes nearly everything (if not, EVERYTHING). I strongly recommend you try fate/zero. It is one of a kind.",

    "Wolf's Rain": [
        "The animation is beautiful and it reminds me of Cowboy Bebop. If you cross Hige and Kiba you get the tall guy in CB. Anyway, the story is very interesting and convoluted, with many characters going their own way, but always bumping into each other and a lot of mystical stuff from the Japanese mythology.Everything revolves around a Lunar Tome that describes what the end of the world would look like and how the world was actually made by wolves. I seem to remember an episode in Inuyasha where the action revolved around a lunar scroll and a red moon and a poem, so I guess this is some story every Japanese knows and I don't.The music is better than most animes, but it's in English, again reminding me of Cowboy Bebop. Overall I thought it was marvelously drawn, with a nice story and a lot of potential. Alas, it all broke down around episode 15, when the show had 4 episodes made entirely of flashbacks. Worse, after these episodes, everything just goes Japocalyptic and sad. Even the last message of hope is tainted by evil, even if I could swear somebody hummed \"Spreading the seeds of love\" while drawing the last few scenes.I guess that the moral of the story is that there is a single world and we should make good by it, but after such a sad ending and mystical mambo-jumbo, all one wants is to wipe out tears and watch some comedy.Bottom line: Very good 26+4 episodes show, better than most animes, but inconsistent. The first episodes seem very different from the last. Also, being Japanese probably helps one understand a lot of stuff there.",
        "\"Wolf's Rain\" is one of the most beautiful and inspiring anime shows that I've ever saw. I'm not a big fan of anime, but I loved this show. The animation, the characters, the story, and the music (The great music made by Yokko Kanno, who also made the score for very good animated shows as \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Escaflowne\") all was perfect.The story, despite being somewhat strange, it is captivating and wonderful since the very first moment. \"Wolf's Rain\" it is one of those anime shows that you could see thousands of times, and always have the same magic and charm.And about the last episodes...I know that many reviewers disliked the ending, but, personally, I thought that it was a perfect ending for a show like this, the kind of ending that is sad and emotional, but fulfilling and hopeful at the same time.\"Wolf's Rain\" is a great anime show, and I highly recommend it to anyone.",
        "I tried submitting an actual review with a lotta words on it but it was completely lost due to IMDB not having a drafts feature to automatically save the review and gave me a pointless error message instead. Anyways this anime was a great film, loved how it represents the dog and wolf communities. Made me cry in some scenes and the fighting scenes were awesome! 9/10 i give it!",
        "4 human/hybrid wolves (Tsume, Toboe, Kiba and Hige) leave the city in search of find a place called paradise. A places where wolves can run free but they don't know if it exists or not.The anime had a very beautiful art style, with an amazing plot which would make you go \"wow\" with character which you would want to remember forever. As a small note the anime has 4 recap episode from episode 15-19 you can bin those episodes if you want to unless if you want to be reminded of what has happened so far. Alongside 4 OVA'S which wraps up the ending to the series, with the actual series (episodes 1-14, 20-25) having 22 episodes all together that will lead to 30 episodes. Just a little guide if you are going to watch the series.Also, screw the dub hater the dub for this series is amazing all of the voice actors put a lot of emotion in their roles, i can't stress this enough. If you see in troll comments that have negativity towards the dub unless if they are very well explain bin them.If you want to have a really good anime which takes you on a breath taking adventure I highly recomand this.",
        "I haven't seen the whole series as I only have the first disc. Its interesting and entertaining with a nice plot. I probably wouldn't recommend it or watch more, but its ok.",
        "This is one of the best anime series I've ever seen. Wolf's Rain is a grim tale set in a dystopic future. There are wolves that become humans. The animation is beautiful, the characters are realistic and believable. The plot and background is sad.. I felt for each of those wolves. In places it was extremely grim and violent. There was a background setting in cities where people live in poverty and lose friends. Some of it was depressing.",
        "WOLF'S RAIN was the one of the first animes that truly hooked me into the genre. Wolf's Rain is a Japanese anime television series created by writer Keiko Nobumoto and produced by BONES. The soundtrack was produced and arranged by Yoko Kanno. It focuses on the journey of four lone wolves, (Kiba, Tsume, Hige, & Toboe) that can mask as humans, who cross paths in a dystopian wasteland future, 200 years after the extinction of all wolves. They follow the scent of the Lunar Flower (Creza) and seek Paradise, all the while evading the enigmatic Darcia.The series is poignant and haunting, one that lingers on long after with it's creative world, captivating characters, surreal concepts and tragic themes. Beautiful, stunning, moving and all around gorgeous-- this series is definitely for the poetic and artistic of anime lovers. Highly recommend for anime fans, as this one is a modern classic. Truly a unique gem. Definitely worth the watch and one to add to the collection.",
        "There has been many great anime show's out there like, \"Naruto\", \"Cowboy Bebop\", \"Dragon Ball Z\", and \"One Piece\". But back when Adult Swim use to show a lot of anime, there was, \"Wolf's Rain\".A Post-Apocalyptic tale about a group of Wolves trying to search for a place called, Paradise.What make's this show really great is the animation, the story, and the character's. The soundtrack was also great. From the opening song, Stray, to the ending credits song, Gravity. The music capture's the dark and moody setting of the show.I do have one small problem with this show. It's the four recap episode's. They were really boring.Overall, \"Wolf's Rain\", is a sad and amazing anime show that is definitely worth watching if you're an anime fan or a Wolf lover.",
        "Thanks to it's charming characters Wolf's Rain can keep one involved enough to make it trough the interesting but badly told story, that just never wants to get started leaving you on the edge of your seat (in a bad way) all along the series. On the other hand Wolf's Rain rather frequently lets you down, probably topped by the 4 - I repeat, four - unforgivable flashback filler episodes (that you might just as well skip) right in the middle of the whole thing, at the one and only point, where it really looks like things could finally lift off. The artistic concept is okay, but the animation is minimum effort, to the point where everything looks just like a colored manga. I espetially found the drawing time saving repeating shots obtrusive.All together, despite it's likable characters and the interesting story, as much as I tried to like it, Wolf's Rain simply drags ass and as it never really reaches any climax, I'd say, it's rather a waste of time than anything else.We've all seen better than that.4/10",
        "This really is a fine showI watched it 2 years ago and have never forgotten the emotional arc of the story.The ending was so emotional - I cried for days.It is a sad and dark tale about a pack of wolves trying to survive in a hostile world, on their way to a place they call \"Paradise\" which apparently is a better place than their present.Recommended if you like serious, melancholic, thought-provoking series.2nd SUMMARY as I thought my first was too brief -- Many, many, many years ago the Earth was ruled by wolves. Today they are just mythical beings, existing only in fairy-tales. But that's what people think. Wolves have adapted themselves to live among the mortals by taking human form, but they are faster, stronger and more flexible than any human. In those ancient times mankind has prospered to its highest peek. But something happened (and nobody's quite sure what it was) and civilization has collapsed. Now, a tyrant rules every city. People are miserable. The legend says that wolves will come back and bring Paradise to Earth...Main character names are given by their traits (Kiba = Fang, Tsume = Claw, Hige = Whiskers, Toboe Howling).VERDICT -- Wolf's Rain is one of the best Anime series. It has something for every generation. Most of today's TV shows are there to make you stay by your couch absorbing dumb information that mean squat! This Anime will glue you to a couch but from a very different reason. I really enjoyed Wolf's Rain and I sincerely hope that you will too...Honestly, Wolf's Rain is one of the greatest tales ever been told. In all of the 30 episodes in which it is contained, it proofed to be an overwhelming experience. This begins at the very first episode and brings the viewer to a dramatic and beautiful climactic end.",
        "This is one of the single most important anime series ever, it single-handedly helped revive the fan side of the industry and created a digi-sub boom. That is why I love this show. I had waited for this show for ages when I first heard about it, when I finally saw it I was amazed. Atmosphere is the body of the show. From beginning to end this show is presented as a simple adventure/mystery story, but it is much more than that. There is far more to praise in this show than a great number of what was on at the time of its premier in Japan, but this along with Witch Hunter Robin and Gundam Seed represent the kind of quality that the current industry is capable of.Enough Praise...Yes there is a lot going for it, plot, character designs, music, atmosphere, character development, but it has one downside, much like the afore mentioned Witch Hunter Robin, it is essentially an Evangelion clone. This is not evident until the end of the show, and it does not hamper the quality of the show, but it does promote a trend. The ending, unlike Evangelion, is happy, and is the most amazing ending one could possibly ever wish for out of this show, but it is a bit cryptic, but satisfying nonetheless.Wolf's Rain is gold, the kind of gold that we get today. Hopefully we get more like it in the upcoming years.",
        "Just finished watching episode 27-30 (which were delayed and only released on DVD for some reason, I think a conflict with the network airing in Japan).   The original 26 episodes aired on TV though.\nThe ending reminded me of the RahXephon one, and probably not without coincidence, since Bones (the studio making the anime) did both series.\nIt is a sad and dark tale about a pack of wolves trying to survive in a hostile world, on their way to a place they call \"Paradise\" which apparently is a better place than their present.Recommended if you like serious, melancholic and a bit thought-provoking series.  8 out of 10",
        "*Spoilers*The story of Wolf's Rain centers around four wolves searching for paradise. The opening theme is perfect for this premise as it conveys the tone of the show. The characters are all unique and like able, but the premise of the show is what makes people want to watch. We want to know and we hope that they find paradise in the end. The characters drop everything in search for an ideal and continue to push on even when hardship falls on them. The wolves are inspiring and the show has a romantic tone that appeals to me personally and obviously to many others. The reason I did not give this a show a ten is the story is kind of convoluted at times, has four filler recap episodes, and I didn't like a certain character that they meet later in the series. I have a love-hate relationship with this anime, but mostly love. It is kind of frustrating to want to see the ending so bad but be continuously denied it as the show presses on. This could be a flaw in pacing or could have just been intentional. Either way I would recommend this to any anime fan.",
        "I've just viewing finished Wolf's Rain. In the following personal reaction, I will try to avoid giving away too much and will speak in generalities, but it might still be better to see the series first if you want to avoid any possible spoilers.One study of this anime series by Susan J. Napier tends to focus on a nihilistic approach. She sees this anime as dramatising a fruitless attempt to engage with a complex and essentially meaningless world through the form of a fairy tale. The human condition {conveyed by the metaphor of the wolf character avatar} has as its reward only the heroism of the struggle. She notes that the heroism shown is principally developed through masculinity and thus represents only a partial answer which must ultimately fail. Yet she doesn't show that the incorporation of a feminine anime principle would change anything.Despite the brilliance of Napier's analysis, I don't agree with her at all. I think she minimises or ignores the final vital sequence at the very end of the final episode. The fairy tale has at its core Tolkien's concept of the \"eucatastrophe\" i.e. the denial of a final defeat. In Wolf's Rain this concept is developed through the quest for Paradise which can be defined as cyclic regeneration, a sweeping away of the dross and debris of failed attempts to control Nature and the acceptance of a rebirth. To me the end of the series was a deep affirmation of growth, cleansing, and the certainty that \"Though lovers be lost, Love is not\". Thus, I feel that the final message which Napier feels is negative is in reality positive and proof that a new beginning is possible; Life and Love and Beauty will always spring from the sacrifices of those who have faith in those qualities. The search for Paradise is, therefore, a great quest across the wheel of Time and Life; each successive search brings the goal closer.Wolf's Rain is a sensitive yet dynamic attempt to engage with spirituality which I think rivals that of Ghost in the Shell. The sensitive use of colour with its dark and sombre hues reinforces the very serious message of this remarkable anime. In addition there is an evocative and beautiful soundtrack combined with an excellent English Dub. I would highly recommend this wonderful series.One last point. The plot diverges significantly in some respects from the excellent Manga which is quite a bit more upbeat!",
        "One of my favorite movies growing up was Balto, mostly because I liked wolves growing up. As I got older I was introduced to this anime, and decided I'd give it a shot and all I can really say is, definitely, worth my time. Wolf's Rain is a beautifully crafted story, telling of these wolves who are desperate to find Paradise. Along the way they have many adventures leading up to finding it, really grow as a pack and on a personal level, and really look at the torn world around them and really make you ask the question: does the dream really end once you reach your goal? I enjoyed watching every minute of it, the animation- I can't even describe it, I've never seen wolves more beautifully drawn until I watched this anime. The music, amazing. One moment it is relaxing with beautiful piano music and the next extremely gripping as you get to the more intense scenes. The thoughts of these wolves, their lessons on survival and what it means to have a family and a dream, everything about this anime makes it deserve to be one of the top ten in my book. I can't really complain about the anime at all aside from a small dip in the middle which was honestly kinda boring, buuut it comes back with a bigger bang so it kind of makes up for it.All in all, Wolf's Rain is one of Bones Must-Watch if you are an action/adventure anime fan.",
        "You will gain so much by watching this. Every visceral moment is more than just entertainment. The final episode and closing scene are a masterpiece.",
        "This is one of those series that gets made only once. It's a perfect depiction of the human condition and the soul. Especially the soul. Unforgettable series.\"There is no such place as Paradise. Even if you search to the ends of the Earth, there's nothing at all. No matter how far you walk, it's just the same road, it just goes on and on. But in spite of that...Why am I so driven to find it?\"",
        "It does do everything it intended (*spoilers* throughout - this is more of an analysis of the aftermath)... it uses grey colours, but it's about a dystopia... it's about bleakness... there's ice caps all over, it's the end of the world. It's a kill-or-be-killed world... if there were any cheerful characters it would seem odd (this makes it more poignant, I think). I'd say that makes it an appropriate vehicle for both the visuals and characterizations.For anyone who thinks Kiba's expressions are bland, or binary... what would one expect, if he was the sole survivor of his clan? The only white wolf... should he be cheery? All he could do is obsess about the flower, as that was his idea of peace. Tsume also knew the realities of Freeze City... he spouted some angry lines, but it was the most heartfelt apology to Toboe in the end. He was genuine and poetical when he felt like it... Hige was a traitor, so he had to deflect attention from that through some humour... and Toboe was practically the heart of the group... not very useful practically, but when he nursed the hunter back to life, that was touching, I thought... Quent, besides his coming to terms with wolves and that wonderful moment when he realized who Blue the human was, also served as the 'dirty human', in Darcia's mind (and sure, Darcia was mad, but he was bent on accessing this pinnacle of evolution, so much that he receded to being a wolf... he had just lost his beloved that he hoped to revive, his sole reason for going to Paradise... such irony). Also, the anime's ending is depressing, but that is a moot point, because the story necessitated it, otherwise the 'seed' of the new world couldn't have been planted... creation through destruction.For those who think Cheza had barely any role, or was solely submissive... she was the mythical maiden of flowery beauty, or some such... she was advanced technology, but she still served a pivotal role in the series. She was dragged around only because each Noble thought they could open Paradise to themselves... it might be surreal, but I felt like I could follow the mythical undercurrent well... it wasn't even as oblique as Evangelion, I thought.The characters' motivation were based on instincts... that's supposedly what most canines use... and sure enough, it doesn't make much logical sense to chase a technological flower, but that's how they were 'programmed' (perhaps not in the same sense as Cheza).Then there are the scientist and her detective ex who still dearly loves her... it was such an ascent of hope, that led to such a sharp decline... the ending seemed merely preordained (a reference to its mystical side, which allows the watcher to understand that it's a classical end-of-the-world scenario... which the Indians understood as well... and, though that intermission may have seemed random, it may be based on real-life mythology which centres around nature).Every episode had a mixture of myth, mysticism, conflicts, political intrigue, artistic expression, along with other themes... I've noticed how much effort the creators put into it... not to mention Yoko Kanno's beautifully matching music.",
        "This series is absolutely beautiful! It attempts to blend cultures and legends of many countries (North America, Russia, Japan) and does so in a way that is believable. It flows nicely until the end (except for the four OVAs which are really just flashbacks of the previous episodes) and is one of the saddest, yet somehow comforting endings of any series I've ever seen. The characters are easy to relate to, and their relationships are wonderfully portrayed by both the Japanese and English voice actors. The most touching relationship in this series is that between Kiba, the alpha wolf who desperately searches for Paradise, and Cheza, the Flower Maiden who can lead him there. It is so sweet that I found myself thinking 'aww' several times while watching. Although some may be disappointed with the conclusion, I think it's one of the better ways to end a series (much better than the manga did, by the way) and leaves the viewer thinking about philosophy, religion, and spirituality. An imaginative, creative, and all around great series that everyone (especially wolf lovers like me!) should take the time to watch. If you just want to hear the story, skip the four OVAs (I believe they are the last four on the first volume). You're really not going to miss much if you cut those out.",
        "!!!!!!!!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!Ever have a dream that makes very little sense, but you wake up with tears in your eyes? You lay there in a daze, wishing you could get the dream back. You don't understand it, but you know you've just seen something incredibly beautiful.Well, Wolf's Rain is a lot like one of those dreams.The story is fairly complicated. It's the future and the world is slowly dying, broken up into cities run by nobles. Wolves are considered mythical creatures, but they live right among humans (they can change form in the blink of an eye.) The story centers on four wolves named Kiba, Tsume, Toboe, and Hige (their names mean Fang, Claw, Howling, and Whisker, respectively) who set out on a journey to find a place called Paradise.I'm probably a little biased. As my name suggests, I eat up anything to do with wolves like blueberry pie. Even my online alter-ego happens to be one. But even if you don't worship all things wolfy, you'll probably like this show. The animation is clear and very realistic, from gently falling snow to splattering blood. The music is some of the best I've ever heard-I used to watch this show just to hear \"Gravity\". Superb voice acting and dubbing, which is what bumped this show up past Inuyasha on my \"favorite anime\" list.Even though the final seconds of the series create a horribly disappointing ending, it doesn't matter too much. Each episode grabs you and holds you, then leaves you speechless at the end. I dare you not to get teary eyed as the end draws near and characters start dying. There's nothing more to say, except go watch Wolf's Rain right now. Really, just do it. It has a surreal beauty that goes beyond any other cartoon I've ever seen.Five stars, 10/10, 110%, perfect, brilliant.",
        "SUMMARY -- Many, many, many years ago the Earth was ruled by wolves. Today they are just mythical beings, existing only in fairytales. But that's what people think. Wolves have adapted themselves to live among the mortals by taking human form, but they are faster, stronger and more flexible than any human. In those ancient times mankind has prospered to its highest peek. But something happened (and nobody's quite sure what it was) and civilization has collapsed. Now, a tyrant rules every city. People are miserable. The legend says that wolves will come back and bring Paradise to Earth...MY OPINION -- Wolf's Rain is a 21 or 22 episode (depending of a web site) fairytale, about a pack of wolves searching for Paradise. Animation is superb like in most of latest Anime series (e.g. Hellsing or Cowboy Bebop). It's fluid, clear, and the drawing is very colorful. Characters may be a little clich\u00e9d but that's usual for Anime. Wolf's Rain looks like Mad Max vs. Cowboy Bebop (created by Keiko Nobumoto). The problem with Wolf's Rain is that you have to have some elementary knowledge about Japanese mythology and fairytales. For if you don't the enjoyment won't be complete. Music is excellent. Something like 80's pop-rock. Main character names are given by their traits (Kiba = Fang, Tsume = Claw, Hige = Whiskers, Toboe Howling). There is no dubbed version yet, but if there is I advise you to look the original Japanese language ver. with English subtitles. Acting is good since the actors are veterans from such Anime as Akira, FLCL, Sakura Wars, X, Cowboy Bebop etc. Story is continuing from episode to episode so it means you have to see them all (except maybe ep. 15-18 which are recap, so you can skip them) to fully understand what's going on. Story is interesting, animation is excellent, acting is very good and production is of highest grade. What more a man could want?VERDICT -- Wolf's Rain is one of the best Anime series in the last couple of years (since Cowboy Bebop and Hellsing that is). It has something for every generation. Sometimes it may be confusing, non-consequent or slow but you'll forget all of that with the beginning of the next episode. In the sea of new age animated series for kids there aren't many titles that can praise about intelligent, interesting and action packed story/script, or with good acting as a matter of fact. Most of today's TV shows are there to make you stay by your couch absorbing dumb information that mean squat! This Anime will glue you to a couch but from a very different reason. I really enjoyed Wolf's Rain and I sincerely hope that you will too...",
        "Following the success of Cowboy Bebop and Rah-Xephon, BONES created this 30-part anime about four wolves on their search for Rakuen (Paradise) . . . And it's terrific! Both the Japanese and English cast is great, making the characters come alive, but the animation itself seems to be an homage to \"old-school\" animes like Lupin the 3rd and Case Closed.The soundtrack is great, as well. Yoko Kano (who also composed for Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) works her magic in this show, blending melodic tunes with enchanting lyrics and rock melodies with singers such as Steve Conte, Maaya Sakamoto, and Ilaria Graziano.The characters, although mostly that of the canine variety, are very believable and, at times, quite lovable. You can feel Quent's grief, Toboe's happiness, and Kiba's determination to find Rakuen (Paradise).As for the plot . . . either it takes place on a futuristic Earth or a different planet altogether (the creators don't really go in-depth about that). Anyways, a wolf wanders into Freeze City and eventually, over the course of the first three episodes, pairs-up with three other wolves to find Paradise.My only problem with it is the ending, where the creators took the easy way out and killed-off all of the characters, seemingly following in the steps of Cowboy Bebop (where they killed-off the main character, Spike).But I digress: Wolf's Rain contains one of, if not, the best storyline in anime history, and it has given me something that I could watch over-and-over-again. 10 out of 10.",
        "By synthesizing the breathtaking worldbuilding, artistic cinematography, and Yoko Kanno's majestic compositions - Wolf's Rain I call it the fine art of anime.Worldbuilding: The astounding worldbuilding is doubtlessly the best I have seen in anime. The world of Wolf's Rain comprises of environment and architecture styles ranging from Art Nouveau and Gothic to Ancient Ruins, Futuristic Minimal and Dystopian Industrial. This unique and surreal blend of environment design is reminiscent of the surreal architecture from Shoujo Kakumei Utena. My favorite locations from the anime are: 1. Mine Ruins Town - with it's dreadful and seemly never-ending bridge portraying an exhausting journey and search which may lead to nothingness, 2. Aerial City (Darcia's abandoned Villa) - this magnificat high altitude waterfall town seems to have come out from a futuristic fairy tale, and 3. Jaguara's city - despite the symmetrical, sterile, and minimalistic futuristic design one can still get a glimpses of art nouveau influences such as the door of the bar and bookstore - absolute brilliance.Cinematography: Lots of symmetry was used for the compositions - which articulated the stunning architecture immensely. The POV shift between wolf to human e.g. Kiba vs. Human Tsume/Wolf Tsume & Kiba vs. Human Hige/Wolf Hige was also very novel and intriguing. I enjoyed the story's play with repetition - from the very first episodes Tsume failed to save a human comrade and then comes deja vu he was confronted with the exact same situation with Toboe. Shockingly, this seemly innocent introduction of repetition would become the haunting and traumatizing theme of this anime. Above all, my favorite scene of the entire series would be the wolves running and howling around Cheza under the full moon. It reminded me of the painting \"Dance\" by Matisse. Truly artistic and beautiful.Characters: Magnificent character development, which traumatized me profoundly in the end especially during the death of Toboe, Yaiden's tears of gratefulness, and Tsume's lament. This scene was so heart-wrenching that I could still burst into tears when I think about it. This anime really made me fall in love with wolves - I find their loyalty, devotion, independence, trustworthiness, and teamwork to be so admirable.Story: Wolf's Rain is definitely the most poetic anime that I have seen. It reminded me of my favorite book, Jame's Hilton's Lost Horizon due to the fact that in the end the characters realized the disappointing truth behind what paradise really is. I am truly fascinated by the unpredictable and ambiguous ending ****emphasizing birth, death, and rebirth - the cycle of life and how the world continues to exist in duality with good and evil. The characters went through so much trial - beset with uncertainty, calamity, sorrow, and suffering and in the end (Darcia's) evil will continue to plague the rebirthed world - signifying that paradise is not a physical place, but rather the moment of rebirth where temporarily both good and evil crease to exist. The anime ending with modern day Tokyo filled with industrialized tall buildings shocked me greatly because it was such a huge contrast with the beautiful nature that appeared when the world was being reborn.Wolf's Rain: an alluring story illustrating the cycles of life - its duality and repetition. With such a philosophical yet traumatizing ending, I wonder if I agree with it. Do you?",
        "I enjoy this adventurous suspenseful drama, but one flaw can be said. That they stray off of the course of the storyline way too many times to focus in on each of the main characters and other trite matters. \"Wolf's Rain DVD 4\" is nothing but replays, recollections of the series thus far from the view of the main characters, each handing down a commentary on their own personal episodes. I would say that they read too much into the things they encounter during their journey, and can spend half to entire episodes on something that doesn't even have to do with the main event. It appears as if they are walking towards the end, but would tend to break often and dilly-dally then start up again. But I can see how the creators might have done this intentionally, for the audience to see how intense this journey was which could have gone on for what might've been years. All in all it is fair, there are always new encounters and sights along the way, making every minute of it enjoyable despite the sidetrackings. The story manages to keep a steady tempo throughout each scene, whether stagnant or flowing which is difficult to do, which is why most rivaling animes lack this in their story-telling.",
        "My anime club just got done watching this show and i must say i was deeply impressed by it.  It had some of the best characters and storylines i have ever seen in anime.  Not to mention the fact that the opener \"Stray\" and the closer \"Gravity\" were composed by the goddess of anime music Yoko Kanno. See this show when it comes out April 17th on Cartoon Network, you won't regret it.  Just be prepared because the ending of the show is kinda hard, even for an anime fan like myself to take.  I won't spoil all of it, but let's just say that I was moved to tears during the final episodes.  Also a little production note, the series is originally 26 episodes.  The last 4 episodes were done as an OVA to officially end the series."

    "Fighting Spirit: New Challenger": [
        "To be fair, this is one of the few times I have given a \"10\" rating on the proviso that you have seen the earlier episodes. That said, this is extraordinary. It is almost as if the writers wanted to show that they had really reached their potential. The final Takamura fight consumes the largest number of episodes in the Ippo series and outpunches even the longest Hollywood feature. Impressive and addictive.",
        "A pretty good season and lives up pretty close to the original though not as good. It was definitely worth the watch though. This season was a change of scenery as it took more screentime from Ippo and focused it on other characters such as Takamura and Miyata.The story had pretty good pacing and atmosphere. The elements and plot devices used in this season were a complete match to the original though its getting a tad bit dull with these reused elements. First half of the seasons was solid but the 2nd half was great mostly because of Takmaura Vs Hawk. The fights were awesome.Like I said before this seasons focused less on Ippo and more on other characters. Takaurma dieting was just tuff. Ippo still acts the same but you could certainly see his growth as a boxer. We are introduced to new characters such as Arinie and Hawk and also Itagaki who is quiet a likable character.The music was quiet different in this seasons . They used less electronic music, And relied more on bass, trumpet, and flute. And the intros and outros are nice.Visuals are crisp, smooth, and sharp. The lighting and shading were perfect. Coloring was good too. And the icongraphy is hilarious as usual.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Likely..."

    "Clannad: After Story": [
        "This sequel to 'Clannad' starts shortly after the events in that series and covers the events in Tomoya Okazaki's life for the next seven years. We see his relationship with Nagisa develop and lead to marriage and the birth of Ushio, a daughter. There are various events which will have life changing effects on those involved. The story involves various alternate realities where we see the events play out in different ways.I've tried to keep my precis as vague as possible as there are certain key events which shape later parts of the story which I'd rather not spoil. To use a clich\u00e9 this series is an 'emotional rollercoaster'; at times it is very funny with both slapstick humour and character driven humour at others it is genuinely tear jerking... I don't mean 'there's something in my eye' tears but proper sobbing! This is because the characters involved are well developed and feel real. The animation is of a high quality throughout. Overall I'd say this is a must see if you enjoyed the first series; I wouldn't advise going straight to this as certain elements might seem more than a little confusing.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I have to say, this sequel to Clannad is a lot sadder then the first because Nagisa unfortunately dies from childbirth and Tomoya has to take care of Ushio, their daughter. The poor guy then falls into a deep depression and Ushio unfortunately had to be taken away from him because of that. Years later, he finally reunites with her but then suddenly, she gets the same illness as her mother and unfortunately dies as well. Then in the end we actually get to see Nagisa and Tomoya for the first time they first met. Plus the fact, Nagisa survived the birth and Ushio was able to live healthier then she did in the last part. I really wonder is this Tomoya's thoughts if his daughter and wife were alive, would it be different for them? Or was this a science magic where time really did go backwards for Tomoya because it felt sorry for him? I honestly don't know, the ending was puzzling there but this anime would definitely bring tears to your eyes anyway.I even agree that this anime does at least have the #1 spot for being the saddest out there because it did show unfortunate real events that could happen to any of us. It's really good though but have a tissue or two ready to be used!",
        "This show is amazing. Both the dub and the sub versions of this anime are full of heartwarming emotions, hilarious comedy, and tear-jerking drama. Despite a few supernatural elements, this show accurately shows what it's like to be a working class young man in a large Japanese town, and what it's like to meet, befriend, love and ultimately lose the person you love.Clannad and its sequel series After Story could easily be dismissed by casual anime fans or the uninitiated as a Moe (or overly cute) Harem series, with one male lead, and the rest of the female cast gushing over him. And while they are technically correct, the way it's presented makes the show feel natural, and all the characters motivations and relationships with each other feel legitimate.If there were any gripes I had with the show, it would be the art style. It is very pretty, especially the backgrounds, but when it comes to some of the female characters, especially Nagisa, Tomoyo, and Kotomi, the size of their eyes and pupils look and feel unnatural, beyond that of other Moe characters in other works. It's just a personal preference, but it's weird.Also, when they attempt to do any English (as in, in the original Japanese version) it's very bad. It's forgivable, but one of the songs is written in English, and it makes no sense whatsoever. Fortunately, they keep that aspect to a minimum.Overall, this story is worth seeing, even if you're not a fan of anime in general. Perhaps this will change your mind. There's a lot of good stories in this medium, I don't want anyone to miss out.",
        "Season 1 of \"Clannad\" was very good in my opinion. Episode 9 (The wedding episode) was THE greatest and most touching episode I've ever seen in anime. While the following episodes were good, they weren't great. Still, it was a very good series for me.Season 2 of \"Clannad\" surpasses even that of the first season. It's basically split in 3 different eras: Remaining school days, immediately after graduation/birth, and the aftermath. Very few anime series successfully execute such fast flow of time, but we're treated with the perfect depiction of the life of a man who met his love only to lose it very soon after.This anime series had great drama and inspiration. Really touching story. Visuals by Kyoto Animation was phenomenal, and the music is simply incredible. All truly great masterpieces must have great music to accompany it, and this series certainly did. I personally hated the childish \"Dango Big Family\" song in the beginning, but the song really grew on me by the end of the series. This series really had the magic.What really separates \"Clannad\" from other similar series is that it dedicates good 2~4 episodes for each of the sub-characters while developing the main story for the protagonist. This series is truly life-altering in that it makes you think what your life will be in 5, 10 years, and the value of family. Highly recommended.",
        "Wow....What an experience, I have just started watching anime, You know that weird interest that people are into, the one where people would make fun of you and say it's weird or stupid.To those people I can say... Watch this anime and look me in the face after that. Because this is an amazing series and one genre that i am not into being a guy and all. The story is really well told and written, The characters are lovable with interesting amounts of depth and character development Like the main character who goes from hating his father and being a little childish to a full grown up who ends up respecting his father. The relationships with every character feels real and the way they react to one and another makes it even more interesting to watch. The soundtrack is powerful as well and fits every scene rather nicely. The animation is nice looking and the voice acting in the Japanese audio is great to. The comedy and drama is well done and it made me smile, cry, and gave me a whole range of emotions I had never had in any form of entertainment. This is one of the many reasons why I would love to visit japan one day. Because even tho they have made some crappy stuff(like every country) The staff they do put out like this is even more beautiful then American content IMO Because I tend to have tighter connection to the characters.Overall this anime is emotional, funny, powerful, memorable, lovable, and will stay with you to the day you die.",
        "I was actually nervous to watch After Story because of what I had heard. Even though you'd think the answer for the purpose of that girl and the robot was already explained, it appears it hasn't yet. The story is even more amazing than the first season and after you've watched all of it, you don't feel like you've known these characters for two years (two seasons) but for ten. Up until the ending you have no idea what's going to happen at all to anyone. Here, I think you are watching life unfold. It doesn't feel like a half hour PSA trying to be a comedy it's more like watching these people grow and live their lives. There's happy moments and then there's sad moments. And then there are tragic moments.",
        "Don't watch lightly, because this show will change you and make you realize what really matters in life. I can certainly say it changed me forever.",
        "Even if it has some supernatural elements, Clannad After Story is very much like real life. This series is a continuation of Clannad which is a romance drama set in a high school like many other anime. Clannad on its own is a decent but not great anime and is comprised of certain arcs where the main character Tomoya helps each girl until we finally get to the meat of the story near the end which is his romance with Nagisa. Clannad ends there and then we get the masterful continuation of the romance that is After Story which is unlike any other anime.After Story spans multiple years and we see our characters grow up and subtly change from their previous selves while still being the same person. Its story is simplistic but extremely powerful. The later half of the show especially will make one bawl continuously for episodes. After Story offers a great mix of joy, sadness, nostalgia, depression and euphoria like life itself. The soundtrack deserves a special mention to accomplish all this, since it is so moving.Its ending might be confusing, but paying more attention to detail or researching about it online will clear it up. While Clannad on itself is a decent experience, its the combination of Clannad + After Story makes for a riveting roller coaster of varying emotions. It is a necessary experience that could change ones perception of life.",
        "MAJOR SPOILER I absolutely love the show but it was so soul crushing they killed nagisa and she wasn't really dead they killed ushio after her dad just came back to be a better father then to figure out it was not real and just fear taking over like dang \ud83d\udc94 I cried happy and sad tears this show is spectacular so good and I cried buckets of tears but it was so worth it.",
        "Starts with comedic vibe, then slowly teaches you life lessons about importance of friendships, school life, parenthood etc....\nWhen the background music starts playing, my heart crumbles. Tomoyo Kun....\nBut what wrong the females in Clannad. They eyes are big and so cute. Damn Nagisa and Ushio had given me a emotional stroke. This memories, this feeling I wil never forget.",
        "Every once in a while, you will watch an anime, movie, TV show or even read a story that kind of leaves you in a void. You start seeing things differently, you don't know what to do with yourself, and you begin to question how life works. Clannad, and Clannad Afterstory, is one of these animes. After watching Clannad I got into the sequel, and after watching it, I felt such a void because the story was so amazing so surreal, that it became one of my many favorite anime shows. What makes Clannad different from every other romantic genre, is because of this season right here. When you watch some kind of romance entertainment you get this whole bit of these two love birds trying to get together, and then they finally get together in the end, and then the story ends. You never know what happens afterwards. What makes Clannad so good, is because it doesn't just end where it did in the first season, where the two main characters get together. Instead, After Story takes us to that time in our life when graduation happens, life in high school ends, and adulthood starts. It continues the story to tell us what happens to Tomoya and Naigisa (probably spelling it wrong, but oh well). If you remember the first season, one of the many stories and sayings within it tell us of many different realities, and After Story kind of in a way explains the confusion that we were left in the end. Not only that but more new problems surface, such as old friendships, dealing with work and living on your own, etc. While the original Clannad focused on the problems at school and the importance of family and friends, the After Story focuses on the same stuff, but like I said before in that period of adulthood we all just love. It also brings out one of the most powerful messages that I think personally is the best thing to ask yourself when dealing with school, work, adulthood, marriage, friendships and relationships whatever. If what you dreamed of doesn't happen, and life takes you on this metaphorical trainwreck and continues to beat you senseless time and time again, and all of that was because of a single choice you made long ago: despite maybe having to go through it again knowing the pain and torment you will go through, would you still make that choice again? Will you do that one thing for one person, would you talk to this one, would you do anything differently to change the outcome, or would you do it all again because despite you know how it ends, you still love that person? That being said, this is one of the best anime I have seen thus far, which is big because I don't like romance anime at all. If you're not a fan either don't worry, it's not your typical chick flick. Check it out, and I can personally promise you, you wont be disappointed though. A word to the wise though, this season is more emotionally distressful than the previous due to the relevance of family, friend and romantic relationships that are not just 'oh that sad', but crushingly sad. That being said I don't care how tough you are, the only ONLY way you can watch this season and not cry, is because you have a heart like a brick. Just saying. Me being a guy, I have to admit, I was choked up on a few scenes, but in the end, I was glad I made the choice to go through and watch this show. That being said, check out Clannad After Story if you are a fan of the original, and if you never heard of this show at all, watch both seasons. It is a must.",
        "My emotions!!! Ugh. I love this series. The first series of Clannad was lovely. It was an emotional manipulator as well, but there were more happy than sad moments. I was particularly fond of Fuko's story in part one and enjoyed the fact that we got to delve into a good deal of the characters' lives. So now in After Story, we are treated to the same thing in the first half of the series. There are a lot of laughs (which are welcome if you are aware of what comes in the latter episodes). In this series, I especially liked Misae's story arc. It's heartbreaking, but also much needed to give you a bit of information on the Illusionary World. All is happy and very enjoyable until you get to episode 16. I was lucky enough not to have had this spoiled for me and man, was it sad. I was in tears from 16-22 and taking breaks in between so I could deal with what would come next. Nagisa's passing and the emotion from her family was so heartbreaking. Ushio And Tomoya's relationship was also very well done and I loved the incorporation of Fuko during the somberness. After the first death however, I didn't think we would get another two! I was all tears in episode 21 and the beginning of 22, but the brilliance of Clannad is the ending. The tie to the Illusionary World, the orbs(lights), the relevance of the city and Akio's revelation earlier about wishing for Nagisa to live, and Tomoya's second chance....it was as perfect as it could get. I also loved the tail end with Fuko. The extra episodes were cool and a great tie in to the game. So now that I've gushed over the story, I'll get into the technical stuff. I found the animation to be some of the most gorgeous live seen. The scenery in the different worlds was exquisite and the characters were beautiful. I mean beautifully drawn, and beautifully portrayed. The voice acting was also brilliant and brought to life some of the best personalities I've seen. Akio and Sanae were hilarious as always, along with Sunohara and Fuko. I don't really have a favorite character because I love them all so much, but Nagisa and Tomoya's characters were so well done. They brought this series to life and made the emotional journey better than almost any. The music was perfection. I love love love the Dango song and the score was perfectly placed. i don't really know what else to say... Overall, it's in my top 5. I enjoyed every minute and, though its sad during, it's ultimately happy at the end, tying up loose ends with ease, and making the viewer feel content with their journey. 10/10. Amazing. Watched subbed.",
        "This is as real a fantasy, which is Clannad at its last part, can get. The amount of emotions it made me feel was equivalent to all the emotions I have felt by watching all the other things I have ever watched. The animation is one of the best I have ever seen which is very much expected from Kyoto animation. One thing to tell about which I think is important is that in beginning part of show it may seem normal like a drama, romance type but watch through the end and I am sure you will know the greatness of this anime.",
        "I assume you've seen the first series. If not go check it out first. The spoilers aren't major by the way This series follows on directly after the first and continues with Tomoya helping people out. This was good to watch but I couldn't help feeling they should of put it in the first series and expand the ending of this series but it doesn't detract from anything. I'll also assume you know about the characters, again if not check out my review on the first series (Which I haven't done as of yet but it should be done tomorrow) Everyone graduates from school asides from Nagisa who sadly falls ill again as is to be expected. Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship is growing very well. Tomoya is bored as he has finished school and Nagisa hasn't and after awhile decides to get a job with Yushino (Cocos ((Koko?)) husband/Fuko's Stepdad) and eventually buys a flat. After a while Nagisa moves in with him. Everything is going well until Tomoya loses a job offer due to something his father did. He is very angry and upset and after some comforting from Nagisa asks for her hand in marriage. They eventually get married and that's all I'm gonna say as anything else will be a spoiler Annoyingly and this is for the people who know what i'm talking about. I was gutted after the second \"thing\" happened obviously but I wish more was shown as in other characters reactions it moved on far too quickly and that might be a good thing because it would be far too sad then.All I can say is from there on it goes downhill. I'm sure you've heard how sad After Story is and let me tell you it VERY sad. I'm a 17 year old guy and I cried.The animation is still perfect and the music is pretty much exactly the same as the first which isn't a bad thing in the slightest.Overall check out After Story it is vastly better than the excellent first series but some people might find the change to drama a bit distracting. I will say though that no matter how sad it is (which it is) there is a happy ending",
        "If clanned is great then after story is the greatest.\nIt is as good as that.\nQuiet possibly greatest sequel ever.",
        "Very sad anime. Totally a masterpiece. I liked the Kyou chapter most. No 1 romantic anime with beautiful soundtrack. I also recommend people to see White Album anime.",
        "If you watched Clannad (regardless if you enjoyed it) watch Afterstory. It will definitely change the outlook on the series. Great arcs (my favorite is the underrated Yoshino Yusuke) and very great writing, a beautiful soundtrack, beautiful animation, not so amazing English dub but that's what subs are for, and good characters--------Spoilers starts here------But the ending, oh my god. Seriously? That was best you could do Jun Maeda (writer). Basically erase everything that happened and made all the events in Afterstory never happen. That was horrible. The entire series you saw a girl (resembling the main character's daughter Ushio) and a robot. It ended up tying up with this stupid light orb crap that made every time sunshine happy which brought his (later on) dead daughter and wife back to life. I'm sorry but seriously? I believe Jun Maeda could of done this instead and Clannad Afterstory would of have been amazing. The girl symbolized Ushio and her bringing her father out of a depression of losing his wife, the robot is able to walk again (meaning to be happy) and live with Ushio.There was no reason to bring Nagisa (the main character's wife) back to life. That was like giving the fan base a cookie, you don't give the fan base a cookie. You give them a series to enjoy, not this extra sappy crap. (But I do love cookies so thank you Mr. Maeda. But you should kept Nagisa dead) The main character could of gone through so much more and so much greater character development is Nagisa never came back to life and Ushio lived. That is one of the reasons I like the movie better, it actually does that. ----Spoiler over-----Anyway regardless of my rant, great anime.",
        "When I first heard of Clannad. I really just thought it was another silly, cheesy, and bad romance anime. I thought people were exaggerating how sad it was supposed to be. In all honest, all though the animation is good, the art-style was a big turn off for me. I ended up giving it a try after hearing a bit more about, and I watched season 1, and believe it or not quite liked it, it wasn't perfect, but it was much better than the way I originally imagined it to be. I liked it's humor and characters, even though I thought the main love interest Nagisa, wasn't a very interesting character. The romance was also done in a way that isn't obnoxious (I tend to hate romances because of this). There was also some decently touching and slightly sad moments in the series. I gave Clannad an 8/10. Then I watched Clannad: After Story. I can tell you right away that people aren't exaggerating about it. This second season is so well done you will never forget it. Admittedly, this series as whole isn't for everyone, but if you thought the first series was at least \"ok\", go and watch After Story right away. I seriously watched Clannad: After Story in less than three days and I'm someone who is extremely pressed for time. Although the first few episodes are lighter in tone like the first season, you soon begin to notice the series progression to becoming a very realistic and mature take on seeing the lead couple become parents. If you've heard anything about this show, then you know that there are some sad and heart wrenching parts, one event in particular which I will not mention to avoid spoiling anything,but it really had me in tears and was very emotional and sad, yet uplifting and powerful at the same time. Another thing I like about this series is that it avoids almost all stereotypes that appear in any type of romantic film or TV series. They seem to have the need to have the main couple stair at each other and say cheesy lines for a long time, or throw in a random sex scene that isn't really necessary. Clannad never does this type of thing, it makes this series so much better as a whole. Also, I now like Nagisa, her character shows a lot more in this season. Overall this is an experience that I wish everyone could see and enjoy, I know some might not be able to get into this, but if you can in any way you just have to watch to the end. Speaking of the end, if anyone tells you it's a cop-out, don't listen, if you actually use your brain for a few minutes the ending works well and is satisfying.This show actually taught me things. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it opened my eyes. Without a doubt a 10/10.",
        "Clannad; After Story's charm does not exist within the film, it exists within you. An emotional roller coaster has never been this subtle but yet so beautiful.Clannad; After Story remains a landmark in modern anime series within its particular genre, but will it stand the test of time? Well, I'm sure that 90 per cent of people who have seen this show, say it will. But we will have to wait to know for sure.What follows is an astounding series that will break even the most cynical persons heart and that is this series absolute driving force. Never before has a series ever made me so emotionally attached to its characters as this.And when you can't take it anymore, this series plunges straight in to you. Driving our tears to their absolute max in this absolute phenomenon.",
        "Are you ready to cry till you dry laugh till you die smile till it hurts than clannad after story is for you but you have to watch clannad first if you think clannad was good then you havent seen clannad after story ive never cried so much",
        "This is so good...i was lived in this anime...i love it so much..",
        "This series gets very close to perfection. Had a few scenes I didn't like, but overall was almost perfect.This second season to an amazing start flowed extremely well. By episode 11 of season 1 I was already amazed. That was simply filler compared to this.The character development was done so well that I could feel every emotion the characters were having, almost as if it were happening to me. That being said, I could really feel the love between Tomoya and Nagisa. They have even more adventures through stories together in this season but by, maybe episode 10 (can't remember exactly) it shoved off the back-stories and focused on Tomoya and Nagisa. This was where the best part of the series took place.The couple gets married, and moves in together. One line I must address is when everyone is together: Tomoya, Nagisa, Kyou, Ryou, Kotomi, and I think Sunohara, and Kyou wants Tomoya's attention. She addresses him, \"Oi, Okazaki!\" That being his last name. Both Tomoya and Nagisa answer, as to say they're both Okazaki, their families are merged. I thought it was sweet.I'm not one to cry in a show or movie, but Nagisa's death, the Ushio moment, and Ushio's death ALL deserved it very well. The music accompanying each moment was absolutely flawless, especially \"Snowfield\" played in Ushio's death. I even felt like falling into depression at Ushio's death, it was so sad, and the acting was brilliant, and portrayed the pain VERY well.The happy ending worked out SO well. Personally, I prefer the ending to the movie (watch it constantly) but this one was amazing as well. Besides, after all the sadness from this series, you're praying to god that something happy happens. And sure enough, it does.This show completely changed my life, without exaggeration. It changed my whole way of thinking to something more thoughtful and deep. It gave me more morals and brightened my spirit. Recommended to EVERYONE. I do not know of one person who saw this and didn't love it. Anyone who desires a brighter state of mind, watch this. It doesn't even matter if you've read the spoilers, I watched the movie first and got the effect I should have from the series.",
        "I have never been so moved by another film, TV series or animation in my entire life as I have been with 'Clannad'.Prior to watching this, I had seen 'Air' which is another made by the same company. 'Air' was the first thing that had ever brought a tear to my eye, I considered myself as emotional as a stone wall when it came to watching things like films and TV series because I couldn't connect with the characters but for some reason I cannot explain, I was simply captivated by 'Air' whether it was the animation, the voices, or the story, it was incredible.I truly believed I would never experience something greater... and then I watched 'Clannad'. Clannad is split into two parts (Series), the first revolves around Tomoya Okazaki helping Nagisa Furukawa re-establish the theatre club and as a result become better socially as they meet characters along the way, I won't divulge any further about what happens in the second part because it all builds up from the very start.Prepare your heart for an intense emotional roller-coaster that never stops until the very end. In a lot of series, you can often find episodes that are somewhat irrelevant or weaker compared to others. Fortunately this doesn't occur in 'Clannad'. Characters are explored in incredible depth, not just the main characters either, but all of the peripherals too.The characters are simply unforgettable, the OST (Original Soundtrack) is incredible and fits seamlessly with the entire series but 'Clannad' strikes hardest with its beautiful and incredibly touching story. I shed so many tears while watching 'Clannad' and it felt like a truly cleansing experience.While 'Clannad' would be the first Anime I recommend to someone, the story can be quite difficult to understand in its entirety due to the unconventional subplot that is often seen in Anime that prevents them from being immediately accessible and I don't wish anyone to have a tainted experience of it by not understanding it fully. However I believe anyone that has even a decent experience of watching Anime would be able to understand it fully and appreciate it for what it truly is. A masterpiece.",
        "I've known about this series, especially after story for a long time and heard many praises for it and all I can say is...That was pathetic.For anyone who thinks this story is heart-rending or any quality whatsoever probably comes from some of the \"\"\"dark\"\"\" concepts it deals with. I.e. Death, loss of a child, neglecting your son, etc. But it handles these issues so poorly and without and nuance or with any relevance to reality.All the characters aimlessly wander about and don't actually grow. Our main protagonist is the typical centre of a harem and he's the centre of attention by all the girls around him. In the 2nd series I was looking forward to Nagisas death because I thought it might add some depth to the predictable drama but it amazingly didn't. It spent no time on her death or the grief from Tomoya and just skips 5 YEARS LATER. This is the same with their entire relationship, we jump around so quickly passing by years at a time and they still have trouble just holding hands???This show was written by children, for children who think it's much deeper than it actually is. If you want something that handles death and the lasting impacts of it on people go watch Grave of the Fireflies it's infinitely better.Adding onto this, I would've respected this show if they had subverted the Harem genre by giving Tomoya everything he ever wanted, and ripping it away piece by piece. But they didn't.",
        "I think that this is the first anime series that transcends the genre. It demonstrates that anime is not just for children.I've never cried to any show/film in my life, ever. Titanic - no, Lassie - no, ET - no\nWatching this, I thought I was going to die of dehydration - no exaggeration. Omg I spent ages trying to just stop sobbing.Loved the music, so I bought the soundtrack - first thing I did, you guessed it wept!!The Nagisa track is the worst for setting me off!From joy to soul crushing despair, you will experience emotions you never knew you had! Should be compulsory viewing, on everyone's bucket list."

    "Slam Dunk": [
        "Of all the Sports anime and manga that I've seen in my life, \"Slam Dunk\" remains as my favorite.What made this series so good were the characters: All of them (including the occasional antagonists) were very likable and interesting. And most of them were very, very funny. (Particularly the main character, Hanamichi Sakuragi) While this anime had some of the common flaws that other anime shows about sports usually have (like for example, the extremely long matches that could go on for many episodes) the effective gags and the sympathetic cast made even the most tedious story arcs to be worth-watching.And even without a incredibly level of animation (Though I liked the character designs) this series managed to be something amazingly entertaining. I think that this is probably the only Sports anime that I followed from beginning to end.",
        "I'm scanning through a lot of good sports anime that are worth watching and this classic is one of them. Omg guys this anime is so friggin hilarious! You wouldn't imagine how I felt with my cheeks being stiff af from laughing...seriously...If you liked Michael Jordon back in the day with Space Jam or follow up on basketball, you definitely should give this 1990s anime a chance y'all. It's so good to watch if you need a laugh or excitement in your life. You even don't have to like basketball either to not like this classic!!!",
        "\"Slam Dunk: Suramu Danku\" is a slam-dunk of an anime that brilliantly captures the heart and soul of basketball. The voice acting immerses you in the intense world of high school sports, with characters who feel like old friends. The film editing keeps the games exhilarating and the story engaging, though it's worth noting the series' age. The music amps up the excitement, making each dunk and dribble feel like a thrilling spectacle. The show's strength lies in its powerful message of perseverance, teamwork, and the pursuit of one's dreams. While the cinematography may not be groundbreaking, it effectively conveys the adrenaline of the court. With an 8/10 rating, \"Slam Dunk: Suramu Danku\" is an anime slam dunk that combines sportsmanship, humor, and passion in a way that leaves fans cheering for more.",
        "\"Light Hearted, Hilarious, and EnjoyableThis anime and Hajime No Ippo I think laid the groundwork for most future sports anime similar in vibes, themes, and music. The sounds and the music was well done it was upbeat and had this happy sort of vibe coming out of it which really matched with the anime. The visuals were nice and not that bad considering that Slam Dunk first came out in 1993 and it got better as the series went on. The story was good it had it's hiccups and bumps here and there but they had pretty good consistency for most of the 101 episodes. It started off slow in the beginning but picked it's pace up later on. I just hated how some matches would be short and span maybe 1 or 2 episodes and then others would be crazy long 6 to 7 episodes. They did a good representation of how basketball is played in real life but had some missing pieces of what makes basketball, basketball but it was still nicely shown. It had some annoying some typical school clich\u00e9s but most of it was easy to ignore. Most of the characters were alright I think Akagi, Mitsui , Anzai were the most flushed out and well written out of all them. The ending was kind of a cliff hanger and left some unanswered questions. Also it felt a bit too comical at times especially during the matches. And even at times I preferred what happened outside the basketball court such as their everyday life.Overall I think it was a respectable anime, even though It was alright in terms of story I enjoyed it very much. The best thing about it was the comedy and the progress you make with with Sakuragi in the basics of basketball and you learn more as the story advances. I felt like it had much more untapped potential such as adding family into the mix which would have made character dynamics more interesting and realistic, their backstories or how they grew up, and their daily life other than school and basketball. All this would have made the anime more realistic and more believable and we could have been even more connected with the characters.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Quiet unlikely..",
        "To anyone who followed the whole series you will never forget Sakuragi, Sendoh and of course rukawa.Saw this series back in 2001 and got hooked right away. The clever mix of basketball, character personalities and comedy is so effective. This is one of the rare anime's i'll always remember. If not the funniest ever then its definitely up there.Hopefully the movie thats being made is up to the part and loyal to the theme of the anime. If you haven't seen it try to get hold of it, you wont regret following the series even if it is 14 years ago now. I guarantee you'll have the biggest laughs in an anime series. The only downside is they never made the part after episode 101. I hoped for a longest time they would produce the national championship season. Anyway Im still thankfull there is the 101 eps to be passed on.10/10 no doubt SLAM DUNK ALWAYS\".",
        "It is such pure 2D anime. The character's personality remains the same as 20 years ago, and the music gives me the feeling of retro rock. Japanese dubbing and sound effects are also good.But the plot was rather tedious. I haven't seen many sports anime, including 'Baseball Heroes' and this one. But these two episodes have similarities. The leading actor of 'Baseball Heroes' is twin brothers, and in \"Slam Dunk\" is the Miyagi brothers born on the same day of the same month. One of the brothers always carry premature fates and the whole family hopes. It is important to fulfill their dead brothers' dream rather than their own. It seems to be the biggest motivation to persevere.In this anime, get discouragement, get more and more discouragement, and then recall the past, and get power at once until the final victory. It's difficult to touch me.A nostalgic film didn't make me cry, so at most it passed the line.",
        "It's sad that the anime never finished , but the manga is very good u should try reading the manga after anime.In my opinion this anime is as good a KNB ( just little more realistic) unlike knb we can see the improvement of MC from zero.",
        "I am really bad at basketball and because of that, i dislike it, however, watching this show changed my opinion about basket ball completely. Shows like Hajime No Ippo and Eye Shield 21 were DECENT compared to this one. Looking at Sakuragi Hanamichi, a big time delinquent, start out as the foul out king...and later the rebound king shows that how dedicated a person becomes a pro. Another thing i though great about this show was rivalry...if you Love Naruto ( Sasuke vs Naruto) than you will love this one because the rival is a true genius that even Sakuragi was not as good as him(even in the end). One of the biggest things i liked about the show was Team work. It shows that even with Rukawa Kaede's overall talent, Mitsui Hisashi's 3 pointer, Miyagi Riyota's speed, Sakuragi Hanamichi's Rebounds and Akagi's gorilla dunk...they all need each other to gain victory. The other amazing thing is that the competition is competitive. Schools like Shoyo( captain and coach Fujima) and Keinan (captain Maki)have a rivalry building up and another school rivalry would be Ryonan (point guard Sendo) and Shohoku (Cunning and talented Rukawa). Slam Dunk is the number 0ne sports anime in my opinion because of the story line, rivalry, comedy,romance ( sort of), animation and my all time favorite...RUKAWA ( Note* i am not a girl...i just think he is cool. I recommend this to any basketball or animefan.",
        "It has been 21 years the first time I watched this amazing story and I still watch it (I am 35 at the moment).To be honest, if you compare to modern equivalents for this sort of story, you may think flashback concept is not enough to constitute the story. Yet, the concept it self works really well and comedy factor is ridiculously fantastic.\nThere is only one sour thing makes me sad which is not to see Sannoh match as in Manga.I am extremely grateful for mangaka Takehiko Inoue for this story as well as the animation team and voice actors.",
        "I love this anime! It's one of the best I've ever seen! Most of the characters are likable, the story is great and it has depth, and the animation gotten better as it progressed! The humour is just right and the main protagonist, Sakuragi Hanamichi is the best main character ever!!! I watched this when i was a kid and now I'm re-watching it again! First off, it's really amazing to see Sakuragi's progress from a slacker guy to an awesome basketball player. Of course, mix the hard trainings and tough matches with his stubborn and fiery personality, and you get humour! The animation was good overall but it was better later in the series. When I saw Sakuragi getting a rebound or making a dunk, I get chills down my spine. So props to the guys who animated the story.There was also that Dr. T guy. He provided some useful informations on basketball. Though I find him annoying sometimes for stopping a game, he did give info on basketball plays and rules.About Haruko and Rukawa, I don't think there's much between them because Rukawa is too occupied with basketball to notice her. But he did eventually took notice of her later in the end. In episode 99, he made a shot in the practice match with Shoyo-Ryonan and Haruko said, \"Nice shot!\" and Rukawa replied, \"Yeah.\" Even the fangirls were jealous of her. So, I guessed he must've acknowledged her at that point. I do think they would be adorable together if Rukawa wasn't so cold and emotionless.But I think Haruko and Sakuragi is much better and cuter because Haruko always treats Sakuragi as her best friend but Sakuragi on the other hand, has a crush on her. So it's interesting to see them interact. And besides, Sakuragi has a good heart deep inside. He doesn't deserve to be heartbroken.All other four Shohoku starting members, Akagi, Rukawa, Mitsui and Miyagi are likable, no, Lovable. And each of them has their own personalities. Akagi with his bossy attitude and his passion for basketball (not to mention he acts like a big bro to Sakuragi), Rukawa who seemed cold but actually is a stubborn person achieving for the best, Mitsui who was a bad guy in the beginning but became a mentor to the younger members in the end and Miyagi with his cuteness and his crush for Ayako-san. So, yeah, this is definitely one of the things that makes an anime great.Even though I really hoped that this anime had continued, I also feel that it ended at the right time, which is the moment they were going to ride the train to the Inter-Highs tournament. If you dragged the series too much, it will eventually become boring and get less ratings.Overall, I am really thankful to the creators of this anime for this series because it had provided a great entertainment, story and inspiration to everyone.",
        "Best ever funny and motivational.Cant tell how much i like this anime. Hope they can make a remake whould be nice.Mmmmm.I saw the arabic version its so funny.",
        "We are still expecting the another season of slamdunk to be aired soon. Its been a long time since we watched this i hope they will continue slam dunk. So many fans are waiting for this.",
        "Many years after this anime finished,when asked why it was over at a imperfect end ,the author answered that the dream in youth are usually unideal.I can't stop worshiping him due to this poetic answer. Inoue has been one of the best cartoonist in Japan.As one of his master works,Slamdunk records his progress in drawing.At the beginning ,the picture is aesthetic ,looking like many anime now days such as \u300aTennis no Ohjisama\u300b,contrary to its realist style later.Being different from drawing style ,the story is interesting and melting from beginning to end.It's undoubtable that Slamdunk stands on the top of sports cartoon ,touching countless teenagers all over the word.When mentioning basketball player,we might think of Sakuragi instead of NBA players. Slamdunk tells a simple story.Basketball changes Sakuragi as he became a respectable basketball player from a dark guy along with his teammates.Most characters are individualistic in this anime and they also have many touched or interesting stories.Above all,slam dunk tells a story about a group of students's growing up in youth time.They are successful though they didn't become champion in that year because they beated themselves in the last game.Their teenage hood get a better view thanking to basketball club. It was ten years since I met this anime.Sakuragi's youth ended in a picture where he said that because I am a genius while my growing up never stop.I am still moved by this story and can get more and more from it.Slamdunk bring me into a world of basketball so I will never forget this anime.",
        "I don't watch sports yet this show is my new fave. I am Canadian and watch it on Prime. 10/10 this is an amazing show. SO FUNNYYY",
        "Inoe's art comes to life with this amazing adaptation of Hanamichi's struggle to become the best basketball player. The character development, the plurality of emotions and the smooth, flowing storytelling will keep you at the edge of your seat. Watch this team climb from zero to zenith in the world of Japanese high school basketball.",
        "Slam Dunk is one of the best sports anime that I have watched so far. Although the old style of its drawing and animation is considered very modest, but the amazing content made me skip all that completely.The comedic side of Slam Dunk is second to none. A pure and beautiful classic comedy. Also, the dramatic aspect of the anime has a wonderful presence. Once you are affected by watching the players achieve part of their ambition, and once again you see them fail and regress. Anime has a realistic side to life that may not be characteristic of most anime as nature. I highly recommend the anime to basketball fans, sports anime lovers in particular, and Japanese anime fans in general. You will not regret watching it unless it is not a sports anime that you love anyway.",
        "This anime has been and will always be my favorite one out there...Growing up Hanamichi was my idol it was always my dream to become the crazy crackheaded talent of a basketball club but I gotta say basket wasn't a thing for me...\nThe way Takehiko prescribes and gives life to these characters is just out of this world I've never seen any author do that.Every character is amazingly written and is special unlike in other mangas/animes which is mostly the protagonists antagonists and deuteragonists...No takehiko is just that way he makes every character special and makes something great out of it...\nI gotta say the animation is that good(obv it was made back in 1993) and so is the pacing but I truly love it even tho it's this way...\nThe story is good,characters are good and so is the plot and everything else in this anime.I've seen alot of sport anime or even read manga about spor t and there are so many god damn things the other mangas/animes lack that slam dunk has.As Takehiko once said : My work is based on real stories not Fictional ones.Even tho the manga has ended back in 1950 Slam Dunk is a monthly top 10 highest selling mangas that just proves how much of a peak it is.It absolutely deserves a 10/10.Thank you Inoue.",
        "I love basketball, and the fact that everyone is so passionate about this game in the series is just great. The character background and how they all come from different places and situations to finally play on the same team and beat everyone on the court with incredible plays and moves and UNDERSTANDING each other (except for hanamichi and rukawa) is, in one word (or two?), heart-lifting, and their personality and skill development throughout the entire series kept me watching every chapter solemnly.You want to go out and play basketball after every chapter of this amazing series. 10/10",
        "I am searching for the rest of the story for years",
        "Slam Dunk is a great anime, from passion for basketball, to comedy, to plot, to execution this series has it all. The series centers around a 1st year High school kid Hanamichi Sakuragi who hated basketball in the beginning but joined the team to impress Haruko(A girl he has a crust on) but later develops a burning passion for the sports himself & he soon becomes one of the main players of his High School team. I hated the fact that they did not finish the comic book, i.e the original story line, but still. This series is a must watch for all the sports lovers. Even if u ever hated Basketball this series will make u love it. It's just THAT good. The main character is an amateur in Basketball. While he learns how to play it. So will you all. There are some great high school rivalries. There are some heart breaks too. In other words this is an absorbing anime. A complete 10/10 from me. Enjoy!",
        "The anime is good but a bit extra childish(immature) that's why I didn't like it much in the first few episodes but when Sakuragi Hanimichi(protagonist) was getting into basketball more and more, I started to like the show. At that time I thought it was best suited for teenagers and I still think that I was correct but in the later parts of the show it reaches its peak and I think everyone would love the latter parts of the show especially the matches they play against the top teams. Those matches are so detailed, they lasts for many episodes that's why I'm not fully satisfied with the show because they ended it in between(what i mean by that is the show is not complete) as the manga has much more to offer. I've heard that they aired this uncomplete version just to promote the manga and/or there was a problem that someone wanted to change the story but in the end the show is not complete and we never get to see Sakuragi Hanimichi at the peak of his abilities as at the end of the show he was still an amateur, more or less."

    "Berserk": [
        "This series follows Guts; a mercenary who wields a huge sword. Normally he doesn't work with others but after meeting the enigmatic Griffith he joins his mercenary group; the Band of the Hawk. They fight alongside each other and the Hawks have more and more success in battle. This makes Griffith one of the king's favourites which upsets the aristocracy who believe he is getting above himself. Over the course of the series the group fight numerous battles and much blood is spilt. We also learn more about Guts and Griffith's pasts. Obviously it isn't all fighting; there is an element of romance involving Casca; the second in command of the Hawks.If you like your anime packed with lots of bloody violence then this is the series for you. Guts might not be a jolly protagonist but the way he swings his huge sword means he is entertaining. The other main characters are entertaining; especially Griffith and Casca. The numerous battles and skirmishes are all exciting even though they aren't all fully animated. Occasionally things do get a little disturbing; most notably when a group of enemies try to rape Casca and towards the end of the series when the band find themselves in a demonic landscape; these scenes mean it isn't really a suitable series for younger viewers. The story, which is actually shown in flashback is gripping and at no point did I feel bored or feel that the story was dragging and at the end I just sat stunned; to say it is shocking is an understatement\u0085 to figure out just who survived I may have to watch the opening episode again!These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "The animation for this series is not so good. Others have said it, as well as the fact that it doesn't really matter. In the end it's the story that gets you hooked, with pretty well defined characters and interesting plot twists.I especially liked how you can definitely find a character to identify with, even if it is not the main character. You start understanding why some things happened a few episodes before and why some of the things will happened next. Unfortunately the story ends with a HUGE twist, without any hope of continuation, which leaves you wanting.I have watched a few anime series start to end these days, including Hellsing, Tsukihime, Elfen Lied, but I liked Berserk a lot more than any of them. Unfortunately I don't have the patience to read the comics, so I guess this is where the story ends for me. I wish they would do more episodes.Again, I noticed this series described as horror. There is no horror within, except maybe the last episode, but it is moving something inside for sure. Watch it.",
        "\"Berserk\" is simply one of the best action anime series ever made.It had all the fun and excitement of series such as \"Lodoss\", though it was done from a much grittier perspective.It's interesting to notice how the original \"Berserk\" anime only a had a few fantasy elements, having a \"realistic\" (but effective) approach of this story, which combined very well elements from epic and horror stories, resulting in something unique (At least for television) It had plenty of action, interesting characters and a fascinating background, that gave the story an incredibly appeal. The animation was reasonable well made, despite having some obvious limitations, the overall result was still pretty effective. The designs of the characters and sceneries were excellent, with many details and more mature aesthetic that gave this an \"edgier\" approach than other fantasy anime series with a more light-hearted tone.\"Berserk\" kept a good level from the very beginning of the story, until the end of it. In fact, the ending left me wanting to see more about this story (Specially considering that this anime doesn't cover all the plot from the original comics) Now that some new \"Berserk\" movies are being made, it was nice experience for me to re-watch this series, and I'm glad to say that this survived the test of time.I just hope that someday all the whole great story done by Kentaro Miura get adapted into an animated format, considering how good it is it. But I'm sure that this will remain as the best adaptation.",
        "To this date, this remains as the best adaptation of the Berserk manga, which is one of the best dark fantasy stories out there.The somber atmosphere and art style captured my attention from the very first episode, and I wish the rest of the manga had been adapted in this format, but I guess the plot would have been seen way too explicit for television. (Believe it or not, this anime actually covers the most tamed part of the source material: It's only at the very final episodes where the series becomes as just as brutal as the original comics)While I highly recommend this series, keep in mind the plot often deals with some disturbing issues like child abuse and rape, and also I must warn you the plot ends in one big cliffhanger (Which manages to be shocking even though considering the very fist episode foreshadows the tragic conclusion taking place after the 25th episode)\"Berserk\" is definately not a happy ride, but is a definately a must-see for anime fans.",
        "I've seen reviews saying that the animation for Berserk isn't very good. I disagree; at times its high-detail is quite remarkable, and the action is very well done. I do admit that in spite of some of the otherwise amazing shots here and there, it does falter in some areas. However, the story and sheer sense of tragedy in the show is rarely seen in animation, Japanese or not.Berserk is memorable, over the top at times, but always watchable. Its pacing is universally appealing and there's a good sense of tension and unpredictability. this is an anime that can be appreciated as a television show, not just an animation show.Please give this 90s gem a watch.",
        "The animation of course could have been much better to make the gore better, but it's 1997 so can't blame that much. The freezing shots looked very cool tho.The exploration of fate, loyalty, betrayal, and purpose was interesting tho. Griffith was a great character that I thought was one dimensional, but actually not. Character arc is probably the strongest aspect of this series.Oh man like Evangelion the last 2 episodes were total mayhem, but this was no where as anxiety-inducing as Evangelion. I liked weird and messed up scenes like these, so even though I was disoriented, I still find the last two episodes good.The pacing was not good every time, especially at the beginning. The time jumps were very annoying and it felt like the next day.Overall, a solid series. 7.5/10.",
        "I love the atmosphere in this show.\nEvery scene feels like I'm right there. I can almost smell the setting.The music is amazing (the opening is one of my new favorites) and the visuals are great, despite its more limited animation.I'm really pleasantly surprised by its slow pace.\nIt really takes its time to develop the characters and spend time with them.Those last three episodes are absolutely insane.It's so good.",
        "Dark and gritty, not something for children as it full with bloods and violences. Tons of action and creepy scenes. The hand-drawn animation style suits the best for the horrofic yet entertaining storyline. Great attention to details and love the inclusion of rough sketches quite often. The storyline is straight forward - going on adventure to hunt monsters and collecting artifacts/medallions, while seeking for revenge. Classic rpg esque execution of monsters hunting. A bit of LGBT representations and POC - Some bad some good. Not a fan of the flow as it heavily featured on the past/flashback, theres flashback in the flashback of a flashback which was really ridiculous for me after the strong episode 1 debut.Great characters design and some were very disturbingly good. Great characters development and skill sets. Marvelous sound scores, giving a very haunted mansion vibe, setting up a very dark adult-horror tone.Perfect voice castings but not a huge fan of the odd choices in the flow of the animation (as it was being skipped sometimes). Marvelous sound scores/tracks. The songs were totally okay - opening song was catchy and very punk pop rock but for me it doesnt suit the tone of the animation & the ending song was creepy & hauntingly good.The commentary on the intro was perfect and very relatable to many. Again this is not for kids. Highly recommended.",
        "\"Shocking, thrilling, and compelling this anime really had me off my seats\".Damn I really underestimated it before I start watching it. Even though I'm not a big fan of fantasy/ horror genre this old anime really got me shook. The music was amazing, during certain scenes and moments, especially the intro. The art and animation were good especially for its times but it wasn't special or anything it was good enough for me. The beginning of this anime was aight but as the pace started picking up it got better and better, especially right before the end, the story was done well especially the world building with the kings, countries etc. The twists and turns of this anime was mad crazy, sometimes I had to pause just to take a rest. The pauses at certain scenes and moments was absolutely amazing to really captivate the audience. Not a single episode was wasted for this anime! The themes were shown well such as one's own power, goals, and dreams.Overall it was a very good anime but with anything good I had some problems with it. The ending was just very confusing, I didn't even know what was going on. There were some confusing and unanswered things that were left out including plot holes. The fan service was just a bit too much in my opinion. Lastly it starts of pretty slow with villains that act the same but once it picks up it gets really good so you have to be pretty patient.Enough with this, I think this is a must watch for those who like fantasy genre. But tbh I think most viewers will really like this animeMemorable: No Rewatchable: Quiet unlikely..",
        "Im basing this review solely on the anime, thus I have not read the manga.Berserk lags far behind regarding the depth in character studies and psychological developments comparing to other series. And the changes that do happens way to slowly, when the anticipated change of the main character at last occurs its already too late to really grasp that he actually has. The characters construction, in this serie, are also very clich\u00e9d, stereotypical and extremely one-dimensional, in addition, their personality have been used too often in movies already to arouse any excitment. The character is too transparent, her true motives and feelings are predictable from the start of the series. Only Griffith's character is really interestingly fleshed out. More and more information about the leader of the Hawks is given with each episode. But Griffith remains shrouded in a cloud of mystery, something isn't right about this character. His weird eyes and the supernatural, emotional dominance he has over his army make him a fascinating character. His true nature remains hidden until the shocking end of the series.What lifts the series above the average is the profound ending and its prime philosophy. Director Naohito Takahashi throws out all he can possibly imagine to completely overwhelm the viewer with a grand surreal finale. In this final sequence, the few vauge hints the viewer got of the series interesting philosophical views all falls into a translucent manifestation. With the last two episodes, it turns out that \"Berserk\" has much more depth than expected.The first, and biggest theme in the world of Berserk is that of fate, and how everything must follow a predetermined course. This has shades of the philosophy of Determinism, which states that everything that defines who we are, our actions and decisions, come from outside of us. This means that free will is an illusion. \"In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true that man has no control; even over his own will.\" When watching Berserk, always keep these words in mind... in the end, they will make sense in a brutal and unforgettable way. They proceed to incline that the lives of humans are small and described as reflections on the surface of a river of causality, completely incapable of altering the course of the river in any way. 'Berserk' tries, especially in the last two episode but essentially throughout the whole serie building up to it, to explain a existential philosophy of humans all deepest emotions and the inescapable fate of the world we live in. It shows the human condition fleshed out, expsosing the haunting and horrifying but natural and instictive inside. A lot of the story is also about a mans own dream and how he should treasure it. But what does it mean, the difference between a reflection on the water, and a fish causing ripples?",
        "In a dark and cruel world, monstrous beings rule the\nShady the fortunes of the people by taking themselves among the people\nmix to manipulate it.It is said that one day a black knight appeared out of nowhere, armed with a huge sword, the \"Dragonslayer\" and a prosthetic crossbow for the left arm lost in a battle.\"Berserk\" is an anime that clearly needs to be remade.The manga offers so much content that would make an excellent anime.Here the anime is unfortunately canceled exactly when it gets exciting.The whole thing was tried again in 2016, but unfortunately with really horrible animations that you can't watch.Unfortunately, I can't give the anime more than a \"worth seeing\".",
        "EDIT: RIP Kentaro Miura...Dont watch the dubbed version. Get the original japanese with subtitles or you will ruin it.This was hands down, one of the best animes ever made. And that is despite the fact that it had limited funding and the animation was not the best. The story telling is superb as you follow the lives of a group of mercenaries who rise to every challenge they are hired to do no matter how improbable. It centers on three main characters, a cold and calculating leader (Griffith), his loyal lieutenant (Casca) and the hot blooded warrior (Gutts) who wanted no part of joining them but was indentured to them via a reckless bet. You also get to know a bunch of minor characters who are important to the mercs.You follow them around for 24 episodes (note that 1st episode is misleading) as the commander tries to build his own army and build his own kingdom. But this is not a happy hero show, its a bit more realistic. There is plenty of satisfying fighting but also awkwardness, tragedy, espionage and luck (both good and bad).In many ways the story makes a great effort to make the show believable and you wont see any clean cut heroes in this one. Yet you still can understand them even when they do wrong. You will run into some demons and magic here and there but it is not the focus of the story which is why I say the 1st episode is very misleading since it makes you think that its a show about the supernatural.This show is a lot like Game of Thrones and predates GoT by more than a decade. Like GoT it has supernatural elements but they are not really the focus. The focus is on the characters and their struggle and I argue the characters here are much better.",
        "A One-off Season was produced in 1997 to promote recently deceased Kentaro Miura's Magnum Opus, and it inadvertently became one of the Greatest Animes ever and just like the army of fans, I will delve into the manga now which is considered one of the Greatest Pieces of Literature. When it comes to Dark Fantasy, there are not many things which can match up to Berserk and its creator's incredible art style & story. This anime focuses on the age old struggle between Destiny and Free Will & human's indomitable will to follow his dreams. It's incredibly bloody violence is filled with heartfelt and nightmarish moments, supplemented by the Iconic Soundtrack. The characters are developed throughout the season and last three episodes are just bone-chillingly Epic. The only con is that it can feel slow at times.",
        "Watching Berserk for the first time, I was very immersed in the aesthetic & time period of the show. I think, even after 20+ years, it's a very unique setting and feel. If you want a good medieval times anime, Berserk should be your go-to.The highlight for me, of course, was the 3 main characters - Guts, Griffith, and Caska. Guts by far had the most interesting story. We see how he went from an outcast little boy to a man, and then from a hardcore soldier to a friend. His experience with Hawks changed him and it was fun to see throughout his journey. Griffith was, however, the most interesting character. He always came across as mysterious yet trusting, almost like a godly figure to others (of course). He had an airy and almost flirtatious personality about him, yet was very powerful as a leader. And he was very layered, which I'll get back to in a bit. And for Caska, I was honestly annoyed at first. I would say half way through I warmed up to her as she went from a whiny girl to the warrior she was supposed to be from the beginning. Her comrades already saw her as strong, but Guts disrupted her peace and it took a while for us to get to that side of her. She went through her own spiritual journey as she continued to fight and be a symbol of girl power.Overall, I loved the story. Pacing was well done. The side characters had personality and were very likeable. It was very satisfying seeing the Hawks move up the ranks as they won battle after after battle. But then the last fourth of the show happened.....Dang, the death of the Queen was a huge turning point. Guts leaving was another turning point as well - Not just for the story, but for Griffith's character. We finally see Griffith fail immediately after his biggest win yet. And on top of that, he lost a friend, maybe more than that. In what I saw as a gay rage, Griffith made love to the princess (borderline rape if you ask me...). By doing so, he signed himself up for a year of crippling torture and allowed his people to be exiled. It was the point of no return for everybody.This final arc in the last part of Berserk was very interesting, more so given that we were now dealing with supernatural elements, such as demons and gods. There was always a supernatural undertone when it came to Griffith and his charm. But up until this point it was almost nonexistent. It was almost out of place however it was also alluded to for so long. The finale was just a hodgepodge of \"what the heck is going on?\" I was shocked watching that episode. All of our favorite side characters that we grew attached to were brutally killed. And it didn't stop there. That final interaction between Guts and Griffith was so dark...And just like that it was over. From the way I see it, the whole show was backstory the the very first episode. But even then, I hate to admit I was very unsatisfied. And I did research on the movies and the manga to no avail. Take away all the context of the production of the manga and anime - the point being is that Berserk has no ending. And what is so disappointing about this is the fact that the universe and the story were so good, and there was so much left open that we will never get to explore. Berserk had so much potential and I hate that we will never see a satisfactory conclusion to such an amazing story.",
        "Game of Thrones could have learned some integrity and consistency from Berserk, rather than imploding.Berserk is a 10/10. Watch it. NOW!",
        "Loved the Gory action, it's among the most bloody I have seen in an animated series. The series is about a band of mercenaries so we get to see a lot of battle scenes. The brutal swordplay, iron armor, castles and cavalry charges reminded me of medieval Europe. The story is deep with focus on friendship, love, ambition and betrayal. But we never get to the end of the journey as the series only covers one Arc, so be ready to be disappointed.The background scores are amazing, the number Gats was my favorite, a haunting number, worked great with all the emotional scenes. Animation is good for the year 1997 but a let-down, considering I watched the series having seen the remake movies Golden Arc, the movies being 15 years fresher with amazing animation.Normally the series deserves a 10 on 10 rating but there being an equally good fresher remake and the story being incomplete I am giving it only 8/10.",
        "An anime adaptation of a manga, Berserk relates the exploits of a close-knit mercenary company centred around three primary characters: the ambitious leader Griffith who pursues his dream fiercely, the battle-loving Guts who is in quest of his purpose, and the loyal commander Casca who is rescued by Griffith in her childhood and falls in love with Guts. The progression of these characters and their relationships lie at the heart of the beauty of Berserk, with Guts' coming of age and purposeful divergence from the band's path creating the setting for Griffith's downfall and that hero-turned-villain's stooping to dark depths to fulfill his lost dream. There are numerous parallels and contrasts between the protagonists' personalities as they change and evolve through the show, and complex themes like existentialism, idolization, origin of good and evil, etc. Feature extensively.A very compelling narrative, Berserk uses these nuanced characters to great effect while also injecting some lightness and levity through its supporting cast. The art is beautiful throughout with the use of still-frame sketches to capture and depict powerful moments. The animation itself is simplistic, a feeling accentuated when watching the show a quarter of a century after it was made, but nonetheless effective at conveying action-packed scenes as well as emotional moments.I did however have some criticisms about the show as well. The ending in particular, while both powerful in its sudden and shocking implications and being a good direction to take in terms of character arcs, could have benefited from a few more episodes. The singular season for the series also made me question the happenings in Episode 1 which were best understood as content for a sequel; wouldn't a short aftermath accomplish the same purpose? Some of the middle episodes felt a little bloated - the medieval battles didn't have a lot of emotional stakes attached to them and the tactical prowess of the opposition commanders was minimal. Finally, the emergence and role of Zodd felt a little confusing beyond his presence being needed to provide some lore-related exposition.These remarks notwithstanding, Berserk is a gripping tale that anime lovers will assuredly enjoy. It would also make for a rewarding watch to anyone searching for an animated fantasy with mature themes and darker elements.",
        "And what a beauty that was. The art is absolutely gorgeous and one of those few things that actually match the definition of 'flawless'. It is purely lossless quality, best retro art release since Cowboy Bebop bluray. After seeing so many series getting bluray's recently and many of them looking worse than DVD releases (such as Death Note with upscale and terrible filters) I am happy to say that one of the most timeless anime series of all time looks now better than ever.Golden Age arc is simply one of the better story arcs in the history of literature and entertainment. I have seen it in the movie remakes, in this series twice and read it once as a manga. It never gets old. You will not have to look it thru nostalgia glasses to appreciate it even after all these years. There is no story quite like this one. If you haven't seen Berserk yet, consider yourself lucky. You can now pick up the Bluray and see it for the first time in the way it was originally meant to be seen. It is one of the best series about friendship and betrayal and you should give it a try asap. And for those who already saw it in inferior quality, there is no better time to rewatch it than now!",
        "Berserk is the 1st anime adaption of the long running manga by Kentarou Miura. It's Seinen with themes of action and adventure.Berserk is about the protagonist Guts who recently has joined the Band of the Hawk. He becomes sucessful, travelling with them and matures throughout. It's 25 episodes and there were no problems with pacing. The story had a melancholy and dark feel to it. Griffith the leader of the band of the hawks was embodied this quite well. He was very comforing to his soldiers. Griffith was a perfect leader until he lost his edge. Then the show tranformed to dreamlike for the last 5 episodes. Indivisualism and reaching your goals were important to this anime. The fiighing in this gorey anime expressed meesages and emotions such as loneliness, determination and resillence. Gut swung his sword with incredible anger to kill his enemies. Guts presense increased uncertanty and ambition. His physical and mental strenght brought power to The Band of the Hawk. Casca was the most realistic character, she had practicality and became more assertive and becomes a great leader. Griffith and Guts become her love interest and it is quite generic.Berserk is animated by OLM. The anmation is great and gory. The fights contain a lot of gore and sword fighting. The character desgins is quite medival and the desigins are great. The expressions were great.I watched the Sub and it was ok. The voice acting was quite average and it relied on the animation to be expressive. The OP was great, I wish more OP's were only 1 minute long instead of 1 and a half. I didn't mind that it was in English. The ED was also great and the simple animation during it enhanced its quality. The soundtrack, overall was good.In conclusion, I thought this anime was great. I would recommend this to older teenagers and adults that like violence and great main characters.",
        "This is a good anime if you want to get introduced to the Berserk franchise and I know for sure it was my introduction because while I prefer the manga, I still love the anime quite a bit.Both subbed and dubbed versions are pretty good though I am neutral on the subbed/dubbed debate personally. But the English dub did pick good voice actors and what captured me on the dubbed version was Marc Diraison voice performance as Guts.This is a great anime of the one of the longest and still good manga out there written and drawn by the great Kentaro Miura! The anime did his manga a decent amount of justice at least.",
        "Undoubtedly nice story and characters, with the addition of the special atmosphere: you always have the feeling that something is wrong, but never able to really catch what.So really great till here, the minus are following:.1: The graphic part it's not really the best, proportions are not always 100% checked and you have also (rarely) \"external stuff\": could have been fine in 1997 but not in 2022.2: The escalation is really vertical in the last 3 episodes, for some people could be fine, some others would argue that the \"story\" is basically cut. And especially due to the last episodes I would say the series is not really ok for minor, imho this is not even 18+, I would rather say 20+, and it is not just due to the show but especially for the message that a young audience would not understand properly: Violence come with violence, and violence is really a pillar of this series.",
        "Berserk is awesome anime you have to watch it has 1 season it has a lot of action and a lot blood and guts",
        "In terms of anime, Berserk is the ultimate apex. Nothing comes close to grabbing and maintaining the spectator's attention for the whole 10 hours of this masterpiece. First and foremost, I'll admit that it isn't ideal. There are some shoddy animation parts, particularly during the action scenes, and the ending is a bit of a bummer since it leaves little room for a sequel. However, and I speak for myself here, the positive aspects of Berserk much outweigh the negative aspects, to the point that they are easily forgotten when seen as a whole. While the visuals are sometimes mediocre, the amazing depth of the plot and the beautiful character development scattered throughout more than compensate for any deficiencies.The narrative of Berserk, a renegade swordsman named Guts, is recounted in twenty-minute episodes over the course of ten hours. Guts, in a nutshell, is the most intriguing fictional character ever conceived. To begin with, Guts is one of the greatest examples of a person driven only by the desire to defend and develop oneself. Every time Guts swings his large sword in the show, he becomes stronger and more murderous before our eyes. His developing connection to others, particularly Griffith and Caska, is genuine. The extremely conflicting emotions Guts has for Caska, in particular, hook the spectator into their world and leave them wanting more as the episode concludes.I can confidently say that the anticipation for each new episode was the most intense I've ever felt for a television program. The music, while completely unnecessary, offers an emotional appeal that stays with you.As you go through Guts and the Band of Hawks' world, you'll find yourself anticipating the opening theme song, which takes some getting used to. In no time, you'll be humming and singing along like it's a smash hit. The climax music, which plays every three episodes or so, is pretty unsettling, and you wonder how it got into an anime.Anyone who hasn't watched Berserk yet is missing out. Despite the ordinary looks, even if you're not a fan of anime or are simply ambivalent about it, you'll be amazed by the great story and well-developed characters.",
        "A pioneering work of the fantasy genre, Kentaro Miura's Berserk has seen its influence spread across different media franchises outside of the realm of manga and anime. As for Berserk itself, those who are in the know are aware of Kentaro Miura's passing in 2021, leaving the status of the manga on hold, until his good friend Kouji Mori, along with Miura's studio, collectively decided to push through in honor of what the man himself would have wanted. While this has been very good news for fans, adaptations are few and far in-between. The very first adaptation of the manga, Berserk 1997, is often regarded as THE Berserk anime that newcomers should see.The excessive graphic content portrayed in the manga tends to turn off potentially interested individuals from diving into the series, but it is also this very detail that separates people who are more discerning and capable of looking beyond the gore and violence and being able to understand the themes and the overall substance and beauty that Berserk has to offer. The anime is much tamer compared to the manga, but there is still a good deal of it over its 25-episode run. It is integral to the plot and its medieval-esque setting after all. The '97 adaptation is centered around the Golden Age Arc, where Guts began his journey as a mercenary, crossing paths with the Band of the Hawk led by Griffith, and their exploits together with the addition of Guts to their party in a time where two nations are at war with each other.While the story for the adaptation is only a small portion of the richer world that is Miura's original work, it is still able to provide a powerful viewing experience that remains untouched. Some may think that the animation and quality is dated by today's standards, but I would think otherwise.The characters central to the story, the dynamics of their relationships, and their individual developments relative to the story at a certain points in time, all cohesively fit together and are excellently narrated.I only have a very minor issue with consistency in terms of the details, like at one point where Guts was bloody and ragged, then not a single stain was visible on him a few moments later. The style of animation holds up very well, everything fits, and nothing seemed out of proportion, save for some instances where the characters are visible from a distance and their facial features are a bit ugly, but this I believe is a common practice and something I've seen in modern big budget anime series as well to save on budget.Plotwise, they were able to create a fantastic adaptation from what was available for them to work with back when the source material had not progressed far enough. Plenty of quotables and lessons imparted by Miura applicable to real life. The questions narrated during next episode previews are also a nice touch to the themes that Berserk covers, something for viewers to think on. It is just unfortunate that we don't get to see this title get the full treatment that others do with several seasons and hundreds of episodes, to capture the larger world of Berserk. The 2016 anime adaptation that serves as a direct continuation to the 97's story has not received as much love due to the choice for animation style used that is consensually agreed upon as inferior. Sometime in the future perhaps, if we are lucky.Finally, the OST. Behelit? Sinister. Gatsu? A myriad of different emotions. Earth? Beautiful, triumphant. Berserk Forces? Glorious. Susumu Hirasawa was on point and only further augmented the fervor of what was already a very convincing and passionate story.Bless Miura's soul. He left us with a work that is one of one. The beloved dark fantasy lives on, and so does Guts' spirit to struggle against destiny.",
        "1) The pilot episode. It ain't shitting around with a slow build up. It begins at a point in the future where the lead character is already somehow betrayed and mutilated by his best friend, and he is on a quest to kill the sucker. The very first episode tells you with a scene from the future how the world became a dark and morbid place, where the people live in fear and demons have crawled in powerful positions of authority, toying sadistically with innocents. It is an extremely powerful plot device to hook you for what is about to follow\u0085 or not. The second episode is actually the story told from the start, as we gradually see how the protagonist grows up in the battlefield, gets more powerful, wields bigger swords (I mean, REALLY bigger swords), how he makes allies, friends, lovers, and enemies. You already know how all that will have a bad outcome because of the pilot episode so you are easily interested to see how all that happened. 2) Gore, splatter, nude and sex. This almost goes without needing an explanation. Sex and violence always sell and this anime has buckets of it. Sounds like brain-dead superficial entertainment but unlike most shows Berserk is only using them as attraction and not as definition. Because to be honest, most heavy on action and/or nude series are usually nothing without these elements while Berserk works fine even without them. Plus, it uses a form of violence that is quite appealing to me; hand-to-hand and sword-to-sword battles between frenzied armored warriors. Using magic or lasers to do the same just doesn't look raw enough.3) Interesting characters. The main three characters are interesting, even if there wasn't a ton of violence and gore in the show. You gradually see them revealing all their inner thoughts to you, their pasts, their goals, their desires and hopes. You see them getting beaten, learning from their mistakes, maturing, being broken by betrayal and coming out more crazy than what they already were. Plus, the aforementioned violence is used to bring out their weak side and hidden thoughts. 4) Political power struggles. The show is not centered on a team of warriors, strolling a generic kingdom and doing stand-alone missions. The world they live in has affected them and is affected back by them, all part of Griffith's goal to leave his mark on the world by getting his own kingdom. Along the way many aristocrats get annoyed by his continual successes and fearing their own agendas to be stolen by him continually try to assassinate him. And he reacts by plotting his own assassinations. All of which happen in secrecy, while the kingdom is at war with its neighbors. So it is not a story about a few brave warriors protecting their good homeland by invading monsters; it is a simple war of political agendas between local kings for whom gets to have all the lands for himself. And not only that; it is also about the internal double crossing the aristocrats do to one another every time one wants to steal the glory from the other. 5) Atheistic take on humanity. Although religion is a topic hardly mentioned directly in anime, over here it is openly trampled as nothing more than a false ideal to hide one's dark desires. It is extremely interesting how the show uses ideals and hopes as means for clergy and ambitious leaders to control their underlings. This was never done before so openly. It even goes as far as claiming how all the demons in the show are in reality people willing to sacrifice everything in order to fulfill their desires, even if it means losing their humanity and killing everyone they love. I really liked how monsters are not treated as generic incarnations of evil or plain misguided mortals; they are shown to be the pure form of ambition liberated by the constraints of morality, emotions and ideals. 6) Psychological symbolisms and imagery. Many parts of the show, usually those involving demons, are full of WTF sceneries, all of which have to do with basic carnal desires and fears. Unlike most shows with demonic dimensions, which are nothing but generic depictions of torture of the damned, here all the monsters and their Eclipse world are directly attributed to their personalities having been given in completely to their desires. The characters are not scared of getting crazy because of them. Heck, they are mostly terrified of becoming like that as well. Not because it is bad or wrong, but because it feels inappropriate for any human being to end up like that. Which is again very interesting as a concept. Cliffhanger ending. This is a part most hate about the show, as it ends in the most exciting and agonizing way possible. But in reality, that is also a plus of the show as it is almost demanding from you to read the manga just to see what happens next. The animators had lots of sloppy moments inserted in the show and most of them have to do with lack of animation and repeated footage and not with bad drawings. The drawings are in fact great. The music score is amongst the most blood boiling pieces of grudge rock and orchestrated epic music even made and easily tops even the animation part of the show. The characters have really appropriate voice actors with no stupid pitches in voice. Even the sound effects were successful, as simple as they may have been. Bottom line, Berserk is fine dark fantasy material, with great action and story and characters. The manga version is of course continuing the story far more than where the anime stops and features far more gore and sex scenes."

    "Monster": [
        "There are no monsters in 'Monster', Hirokazu Koreeda's latest film and the first shot in Japan after a five-year absence and two films made in France and Korea that I personally liked, but many other cinema fans liked less. It is not a horror film either, but rather a combination of a family drama with social cinema, based on an original screenplay written by Y\u00fbji Sakamoto. The subject is an incident that takes place in a school involving 5th graders and their teacher. Y\u00fbji Sakamoto and Hirokazu Koreeda use a technique here that is not entirely new - in fact, one of the famous precedents is found in the history of Japanese cinema and gave its name to the Rashomon effect, as in Akiro Kurosawa's famous 1950 film. Hirokazu Koreeda expanded and improved this technique where different perspectives and points of view of the same events are described by different characters. In \"Monster\", with each of the three iterations of the story, we not only learn more and change perspectives, but also gain a deeper understanding of the heroes and what they stand for.Saori is the single mother of Hinato, a 5th grader. When the signs of a conflict at school appear - changes in behavior but also signs of physical violence - the mother addresses the school management. In her own way, Saori is an exemplary mother, but the child does not communicate much, and the interaction with the school principal and teachers does not work either. The school principal is a grieving grandmother who also has her own problems. In fact, the theme of the first part of the film seemed to be exactly this impossibility to communicate - due to age, due to the formality of teacher-parent relationships or simply the difficulties of communication in a society that avoids direct expression and camouflages it behind ceremonial rules of politeness. The source of the trouble seems to be a young teacher named Hori. He is forced by the principal to apologize, and is then expelled from school only to reappear under strange circumstances. Hinato also has a friend in class, but what is the true nature of their relationship? The second part of the story is told from Professor Hori's perspective, while the third part brings to the fore the relationship between the two children. When we reach the end the perspective is completely changed. The judgments and assumptions made in the first part turn out to have been largely wrong.Hirokazu Koreeda seems to be telling us that in the absence of communication, good intentions are not enough. There is no lack of love between the heroes in this film, but neither the mother knows her son well enough, nor the student's teacher. The much praised and appreciated Japanese ceremonial politeness seems here to be the main object of criticism of the director and screenwriter. Only the two kids, still uncorrupted by the language and manners of adults, manage to make their feelings felt to each other, with few words and more with gestures and joint activities - what we adults call play. As always with Koreeda, the casting is perfect and the focus is on the humanity of the characters. Nature also plays its part. The story in the film is placed between two dramatic events that disturb the calm of a picturesque town located on the edge of a lake: a fire at the beginning, a typhoon that produces landslides at the end. Between them the characters live their dramas. Beautifully filmed and with a soundtrack very well suited to the story, interestingly written and full of humanity and sensitivity, 'Monster' is one of the best films I have seen in recent months.",
        "Hirokazu Kore-eda needs little in terms of introduction, being one of the most internationally hailed and appreciated directors, and a true standout in Japanese film history.This is very much one of his most nuanced, indepth, and overall best dramas throughout his career.It leans on the untold, the subtelities, and the idea of both sides of a story. Much like the Danish masterpiece Jakten by Thomas Vinterberg. But even one step beyond that. The actors all do an incredible job, the adults and younger actors alike, masterful script and acting.The cinematography, cutting and editing is masterful, very much in line with Kore-eda's style, and extremely beautifully put together.Overall, indeed a masterpiece, one of the best of the year, and perhaps the director's best. Highly recommended for any lover of film!",
        "During the initial hour, you may experience a state of complete bewilderment, unsure of the exact themes being portrayed in here. Is it centred around the troubled minds of children, or does it delve into the realms of bullying, abuse, or even something more sinister?Several questions will plague your mind, regardless of your strong inclination to scrutinise this narrative, you will find little to no clarity due to the intricately crafted script that almost follows a 'Rashomon' structure, presenting different perspectives.At the outset, your queries will remain unanswered, requiring further patience. However, if you can somehow endure that burden, the film remarkably unravels itself in the concluding moments, connecting every single dot and revealing its ultimate truth underneath.I must admit, I was blown away by the revelation. The way Hirokazu Koreeda, the director, masterfully navigates through such delicate and complex themes without resorting to any impure contemplations is commendable, to say the very least.\"Monster\" has now undoubtedly become my personal favourite from him, even exceeding one of his most acclaimed work, 'Shoplifters'.P. S. The performances delivered by the two kids, Soya Kurokawa (Minato) and Hinata Hiiragi (Yori), were nothing short of outstanding. The scenes between them never felt superficial, not once, and their maturity, especially considering their young age, deserves nothing but high praise.",
        "The 2023 film by Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda, who has made successful films such as Aruitemo aruitemo, Manbiki Kazoku, Wandafuru raifu, Umi yori mo mada fukaku, Kiseki, left Cannes with the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay awards.Kore-Eda has a special place in my heart not only because he introduced me to Far Eastern cinema in my adolescence, but also because he was the director of Dare mo shiranai, one of my favorite films...Despite this, the editing during the development process of the film seemed to have been completed by another director, not Kore-Eda... We can see Kore-Eda's signature again in the Introduction and Conclusion sections.His trademark Coming-Of-Age narration has produced one of his masterpieces here.Although many critics compared the film to Lukas Dhont's Close, which received awards in the same categories the previous season, Kore-Eda clearly stated what he had to say in this film and did not hold back.Although the movie, which can be watched on Mubi, is not a Dare mo shiranai, it is still one of Kore-Eda's best works.",
        "Lovingly detailed and accented by an aching score from Ryuichi Sakamoto, who died in March, Monster is one of the finest films of the year, and its structure - like its circle of characters - carries secrets that can only be unraveled through patience and empathy. By cutting things up and showing us the perils of fractured perspectives, the director, demonstrates that compassion is more than just a natural state of being. This absorbing, ambiguously titled movie builds to a moving finish, one that reaffirms Kore-eda's peerless skill at directing young actors in particular..My Rating : 8.5/10.",
        "Directed by: Hirokazu Kore-da\nWritten by: Yuki Sakamoto\nDistributed by: Gaga, TohoSUMMARYA Rashomon type of story told in three perspectives: A beleaguered single mother, trying to figure out why her son is being hurt by a teacher in school; An awkward teacher, struggling to navigate misunderstandings in which he somehow ends up the villain; and a young fifth grader falling in love with a boy, standing up to bullying.RATINGA+What an amazing feat here: To tell a quiet drama with the intensity of a thriller. Each story is told movingly, and what I find innovative here is that unlike Rashomon, all the stories don't contradict, but rather complete each other. At each point in the story we are wondering who the \"monster\" is, and I remember thinking that the monster was the seemingly cold principal, the awkward teacher, and even the two children Minato and Yori. I kept thinking they were psychopaths, but that's the point isn't it? That when we don't understand the full picture, we think other humans are monsters. A gay boyhood love story is embedded at the heart here, and ultimately, it ends heartbreakingly.",
        "It takes a saintly patience to sit through the hour-plus of drama that is staged in so called \"RASHOMON EFFECT\" with a vivid characters...The story constructed in three parts whose narrative boundaries are sharply drawn. Each centers on a different character and their point of view...The first part is told by the widow point of view whose son is abused by his class teacher...Second part is told by the teacher who is innocent and kind enough...While the third part is told by the Boy and his point of view which sharply indulges narrow misjudgements and the coming of ages struggles and hopes....What else all you just need is a patience to see the miracle of a true cinema and how it unfolds to give you a wonderful cinematic experience.",
        "Monster, has been making waves in the awards circle and has won several of them; most notably so far- Best Screenplay @ Cannes Film Festival. The poster says \"A Masterclass in Mystery\", I could totally make a case for this film to be called \"A Masterclass in Screenplay\" and can see why it won the award.This film starts off with a single mother demanding answers from a school when her son reports being mistreated there. Heated discussions slowly unravel several incidents which come to define What/Who is the Monster. You get different perspectives of the story and each time, you aren't sure whom to believe and what to trust, only for the plot to eventually reveal what's exactly going on and even then, you may be left thinking about this film for a little while, second-guessing your own understanding of what you watched.While I can't reveal anymore without spoiler stuff, I can say that what I perceived to be true, wasn't. And the film has some commentary on our perception and how/why we choose to believe and are quick to pass judgment. Some commentary, because there's so much in the film. It packs in a LOT of well-written layers that make you wonder \"WHAT is going on? WHO is in the right? WHO is the victim here?\"If you like good cinema and get a chance to watch this one, please do. You're very likely to be blown away and like me, you'll be mad why this wasn't Japan's submission for the Best International Film of the year.",
        "Hirokazu Kore-eda's \"Monster\" doesn't roar, it creeps. It begins with a familiar premise: a concerned mother, a troubled son, and a school incident sparking whispers and suspicion. But within this seemingly ordinary frame, Kore-eda paints a masterpiece of intrigue, where secrets unfurl like layers of an onion, surprising us at every turn.The screenplay is a masterclass in misdirection. Just when you think you've grasped the narrative, it shifts beneath your feet. Characters shed their skins, revealing hidden motivations and vulnerabilities. Each revelation feels organic, not a forced twist, but a natural progression of the intricately woven story.And what a story it is! Kore-eda weaves together seemingly disparate threads - a bully facing his own demons, a teacher haunted by the past, a single mother's relentless quest for truth - and braids them into a tapestry of empathy and suspense. He forces us to confront our own biases, to question perceptions, and to acknowledge the monsters that lurk not just in shadows, but within ourselves.The film's true strength lies in its characters. Kore-eda infuses even the most peripheral players with depth and nuance. He avoids easy binaries, portraying \"monsters\" with heartbreaking vulnerability and heroes with their own shades of darkness. The young actors, in particular, deliver performances that are both raw and poignant, capturing the complexities of childhood with astonishing authenticity.The film's beauty lies not in grand spectacle, but in intimate moments. A whispered confession under a starlit sky, a shared meal that cracks open unspoken truths, a child's tears revealing unspoken pain - these are the scenes that linger long after the credits roll.\"Monster\" is not a film that screams for your attention; it draws you in slowly, patiently, whispering its secrets in the quiet space between scenes. It's a film that rewards slow savoring, one that invites multiple viewings to fully appreciate its layered complexity.If you're looking for a film that will keep you guessing until the very end, challenge your assumptions, and leave you pondering the depths of human nature long after the lights dim, then \"Monster\" is a must-see. It's a testament to Kore-eda's masterful storytelling, a labyrinthine tale that reveals not just the monsters we fear, but the humanity that binds us all.",
        "Hirokazu Kore-eda creates an great complex story that explores lies, adolescence, parenthood, bullying, and queerness. In the past, I have enjoyed many of Kore-eda's films as his works on \"Nobody Knows, Like Father, Like Son, Air Doll, Shoplifters, and Still Walking\" are my favorites from his. This latest film is probably his most complex and emotional work to date and I say it's one of his best works to date.Kore-eda direction on the tone, characters, and writing is strong as he perfectly captures the essence of the scenarios. The writing from Yuji Sakamoto is strong as it creates a complex story on who is really the monster, how actions and words can create consequences, and being told from different perspectives, creates a compelling and emotional rollercoaster of a movie. All of the performances from the cast members are great, including every single child actor and many of the characters are interesting, well-developed and investing while provided with good and realistic dialogue.Many of the themes were well-explored on the cultures of Asian societies, the background and the elements that are happening in the characters. The musical score from Ryuichi Sakamoto is great (May he rest in peace), the camerawork is beautiful, and the tone and atmosphere were emotional, tenseful and engaging throughout. This might be the first Kore-eda film where I became emotional and I did cry a little.Hirokazu Kore-eda continues to shine with his talents and create some of the best Japanese movies in our current times.",
        "The perspective from which we view a situation infallibly provides us with a clear, irrefutable picture of its truthfulness, right? But what happens if we encounter someone who witnesses the same incident and comes away from it with a totally different interpretation? Both views can't be \"right,\" can they? Or is it possible that none of us can see the totality of a scenario and claim to know everything about it? That's the core takeaway from director Kore-eda Hirokazu's latest feature, an ambitious, skillfully crafted tale told from multiple vantage points, all of them \"correct\" in their own right, despite the myriad differences that distinguish them from one another, a storytelling technique first developed by Japanese master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa in the screen classic \"Rashomon\" (1950). Kore-eda's cinematic homage to the famed auteur, told in three separate but interconnected segments, focuses on the exploits of a rebellious pre-teen (Soya Kurokawa) seemingly prone to acting out as a bully. The youth's unpredictable behavior, however, doesn't tell the whole story. His actions appear to be cryptically interwoven with those of his overly protective widowed mother (Sakura Ando), his.young middle school teacher (Eita Nagayama), his aging, softspoken principal (Yuko Tanaka), and his effervescent best friend (Hinata Hiiragi), many of whom aren't always what they seem to be. There are forces at work here that are a cause for concern, prompting the often-asked question, \"Who is the monster?\", a query that provides the inspiration for this film's title. It's intriguing to watch how the picture's various story threads come together, reminding us of the old adage of not judging a book by its cover, poignantly illustrating that, no matter how much we may think we know about a particular situation, there's a good chance we'll never get a complete picture of it. Kore-eda serves up an eye-opening tale, one that gives us pause to think about our impressions and preconceptions in an age when many of us are all too quick to superficially judge what we see - and in a frequently flawed framework at that. The picture could stand to be a little more swiftly paced at times (especially in the final act), but this is arguably the director's best and most sensitive work to date, one that, we can only hope, will have the kind of profound impact we need in an age where open-mindedness and tolerance are traits we could all stand to develop to a much greater degree - particularly when pieces of the puzzle are missing.",
        "Monster (2023)After Shoplifters, Kore-eda's every single film has been added to my watchlist so naturally I was highly excited to see his latest work Monster. While watching, I constantly wondered what the title meant and who was the actual monster in the story because of how well it was written. I wouldn't say the plot is something mind-blowing because at the end of the day, it can be classified as an everyday human story. However, the way in which the narrative unfolded while constantly altering my perception of the characters and the story itself, made it an engaging experience.The film begins with a building engulfed in flames. We aren't told the cause behind the fire and all we see is a young boy named Minato overlooking the blazes. A couple of days later, Minato comes home with some injuries and the mother becomes concerned about his wellbeing. When she goes to confront the school, she notices everyone behaving in a peculiar manner, particularly her son's teacher who becomes the main suspect. Eventually, we get to see the same tale told from the perspective of that teacher as well as Minato's friend Yori.In essence, it is a story of friendship which shows how complicated life can be for school children. It also shows how challenging it is to be a school teacher when it comes to dealing with little Monsters. One particular element that stood out to me was Yori's perpetual optimism no matter what situation he found himself in. While the story slightly meandered at the beginning, it became more interesting with each passing moment. Kore-eda directed the film in a smooth way relying well selected backgrounds and decorations to create an \"everyday\" atmosphere while using a beautiful soundtrack. It's a film that made me feel a lot of things and as I spent time thinking about it, I grew to appreciate it even more.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.",
        "When Hirokazu Kore-eda, one of the greatest living filmmakers, makes a movie, rest assured disappointment is the furthest emotion one would experience. 'Monster' is so many things and so many feelings at the same time-an intelligently woven masterpiece with layers upon layers of humanity, warmth, error, and of course, conflict that evolves with every passing minute.The intricacies of a film as such is nearly impossible to pull off if not for a profound understanding of the human condition-an attribute director Kore-eda has unequivocally demonstrated throughout his legendary career. 'Monster' begins as a story about a single mother's concern for her son's sudden disruptive behavior and effortlessly switches up to be something you understand to be more than what's on screen, but one that you just won't see coming until it's staring right back at you. It's storytelling at its most intelligent and most rewarding.'Monster' is one of those movies where the amazing on- and off-screen work is understandably overshadowed by its own impression, which I too felt appropriate by focusing this review on its impact more so than on its detail. It's also one of those movies where, by the end of it, all you want to do is recommend it to as many people as you can, and that is exactly what I'm doing here. It's worth every minute of your time. Do not miss this!",
        "We live in a society. We live in a society where everyone has to tango around the truth or around a lie. We do this balancing act every day, either in our social life, or at work. We are just trying to get by with our truth, telling lies...like these kids. Like the principal, like the school teacher, like the mother.But these kids will always have it hard, they will always go through this, now, and in the future. It's just a hard truth. It does not matter how much conditioning it is done prior. It's the drama of their own truth. Kore-eda manages beautifully to go around this subject, to study it from all sides and angles, really Rashomon style. Ultimately he is trying to show that life will be happier for all if we stick to the truth, from the start...which is not such a new concept in cinema.",
        "Those expecting a monster movie from a Japanese production will be sorely disappointed. Or maybe not. \"Monster\" might be a giant red herring of a title, but it makes perfect sense once the dust settles.A quaint story of a protective single mother and her withdrawn elementary school age son, this film opens with some seemingly straightforward campus altercations, handled with embarrassingly apologetic inaction on the part of the faculty. As the plot moves forward it grows in mystery, what was crystal clear suddenly turns very cloudy. A clever ploy, reeling in the audience before pulling the rug, yet the real twist here is a gradual reveal of all the characters involved. Nothing is as simple as it seems, yet simple is the goal of all involved. The \"there's two sides to every story\" theory expands to three, maybe four.Goading the viewer into questioning events works well, retracing steps from different points of view generates unforeseen power to previous events. Whose truth is the real truth? Communication fumbles, sketches of memories, well-meaning white lies, trust, and relationship clashes (gender, cultural, generational) are at the heart of the film. Who is the monster (if one even exists), and what exactly does that mean, are slinky questions examined throughout.At the core of the mystery is a refreshing relationship between two very young boys, living in their own fantasy-laden world, keeping the adults, and adulthood at bay. That and the careful attention to detail really does make this feel like a non-animated Studio Ghibli project. A fitting goodbye to Ryuichi Sakamoto who provided his last works to the gorgeous soundtrack, \"Monster\" climaxes in a carefully orchestrated, stormy finale that, like the opening scene, appears straightforward, but is open to various interpretations. One to ponder.hipCRANK.",
        "A popular Internet meme depicts a group of friends sipping Martinis on a pier laughing at a girl hanging on the plank edge, not seeing that she's tied to a bunch of sinking rocks pulling her down the ocean. It's titled, \"You never know what someone is going through. Be kind. Always.\"This, in essence, is the mantra behind Monster, a contemplative and poignant arthouse drama from director Hirokazu Kore-eda.Saori, a single mother, notices strange behavior in her son Minato. His hair has been cut short. There's a cut on his ear. He's muttering about whether he's a \"monster\", even occasionally singing \"Who's the Monster?\" to himself.After pushing his son for an answer, Minato reveals that he was physically abused by his teacher Mr. Hori. Saori confronts Mr. Hori at school for an answer, but to no avail, despite the insincere apologies from the reserved principal Fushimi...Yuji Sakamoto's screenplay is structured like a turnstile, spinning back to the beginning, retelling the narrative from a new character's perspective, and revealing the bigger picture exclusively to the audience.The revealed truth differs from the series of competing subjective accounts identifying the culprit like in Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, nor evokes the dramatic gasp of a grand plot twist like an M. Night Shyamalan film, Kore-eda is fascinated with the inner truths and secrets that reside within his characters that nobody else can see, and examining how people end up neglecting each other.The ensemble cast delivers strong performances, most notably the two lead performances from child actors Soya Kurokawa and Hinata Hiiragi. It's beyond a kiddie cheek-pinching type performance and finds a beautiful balance between dramatic acting and slice of life like we are peering into their lives.There's a glowing warmth to Hirokazu Kore-eda's films. He tackles heavy uncomfortable subject matter head-on, but with an unassuming sincerity towards the unsung, the unexpressed, and the unseen.Kore-eda's inspiringly positive vibes rubbed off on me. Since then I've carried a tiny awareness for people around me, particularly people you greet every day but don't know a thing about, like bus drivers, security guards, or colleagues. In the blink of an eye, I sneak the same thought, hoping that that person is doing fine.",
        "The film certainly depicts an interesting dilemma, and is purposefully left open for interpretation by the director - so here's my take:There's no fault in a worried mother or a troubled teacher, there is only the gap of understanding. And for that I have to blame the Principal, whose inaction and constant aloofness throughout the incident is an unjustifiable wrong. Her bonding moments with Minato alone simply add on to the inconsistency of her character prior - by deliberately tripping over the girl, by forcing Hori into admitting the allegation, and by potentially killing her grandson. Whatever her motive, the Principal is to be blamed for the confusion that could've been avoided.Yori's father is another adult in the absolute wrong - physical violence alone is an undeniable crime. Additionally, the mental pressurizing and coercing is even more harmful to the child above all else, and Yori's immutable optimism itself is a miracle considering such abuse. This father figure furthermore symbolizes the part of society that neglects childcare and youth education, which is what the movie is trying to promote.Bullying is self-evidently wrong, but except that, none of the children are in the fault. Again there is the lack of understanding, though for the children not amongst each other, yet of themselves and of the world, posing them vulnerable to self-harm or harming of others. So here's to the ones who are as confused of themselves as I am: no persons are monsters, and you are enough.RIP Maestro Sakamoto. The film selects a difficult topic for the tone of the narrative, but as soon as the soft, harmonious melody plays in the first scenes, a sense of impartiality, relevancy, and care is naturally set.",
        "Monster is a mystery film of sorts that presents the same series of events from three separate perspectives. It's difficult to say anything about the plot without spoiling parts of the film. At the end, though, I felt as though I had just sat through a masterclass in film construction.The movie is perfectly executed, using each segment to present a different experience and, from the vantage of the characters involved, a different version of reality. At one point, a character claims that \"what actually happened does not matter,\" but the film itself is not taking sides. Instead, it offers up an entirely credible worldview of a worried mother trying to protect her son, then of an awkward schoolteacher finding his world turned upside down, and finally of a confused child attempting to navigate a complicated world. Each portion is fully realized, forcing you to confront the limits of a finite perspective and the all-too-present possibility that we cast aspersions and accusations on others who may be innocent, or at least not nearly as guilty as we perceive. Perhaps the real monster is us after all.The film is a poetic exploration of the importance of humility and empathy. It's beautiful and moving, traversing both the innocence and cruelty of childhood as well as the complex realities of adulthood. I wonder if, having seen the whole thing, I would think less of the earlier parts on a rewatch, but I think it speaks worlds of Monster that I want to see it again just to find out if it really was as excellent as I thought when the credits rolled the first time.",
        "Seen at the Viennale 2023: I wonder, how a good writer can put so much content into 2 hours. Such a good storytelling! A mother, a teacher, a school director and two children. The story is perfectly constructed in such a way that nobody understands the doing of the other person, because people seldom look closer into the truth (or ask the right questions), but interpret within their very own mind frame.The two boys play wonderfully and the movie shows the enormous potential of children, when the parent's leash is not too tight.There was some sort of Happy End and hope, when we left the cinema. And the lesson's learned, to look closer to the truth and not own interpretation, if someone gets into trouble.",
        "Watching Monster is almost like watching Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece \"Rashomon\", it's a film that grips you from start to finish, a film that unravels with every single minute. Not a moment wasted, every part of this movie is vital to the story.Monster follows the story of two friends from fifth graders Minato and Yori, who strike a beautiful friendship that becomes the focal point of many happenings and misunderstandings in this story which makes you ask yourself, who is the real monster? And who is the real villain of this story. The answer is surprisingly complex and for you, the viewer to decide.This movie is masterfully made, every shot is made with purpose. So is the music that accompanies it, made by the late Ryuichi Sakamoto who adorns every scene with his deeply affecting score.The actors make a fantastic job as well, I'm not a fan of child actors but here everyone is doing an amazing job from adult to child.If there's anything negative that I gotta say about this film is that perhaps one plot thread concerning the principal wasn't fully explored in the movie, however I feel that it still becomes very impactful.Please watch Monster, I feel that there's so many ways that we as humans misunderstand each other and there are many factors lying beyond the rumours that people talk about, this is truly a treatise on the grayscale of humanity.",
        "A very well constructed film exploring the complexity of how simple words and actions affect people in unexpected ways. Highly relatable in showing how, armed with only a superficial understanding of a person or situation, context can be manufactured to fit a particular narrative. But not only individuals, but institutions as well are put in the crosshairs. The bureaucratic value placed on appearance and propriety (perhaps more particularly in Japanese society but nevertheless universal) is also critiqued.But the most telling point, and for me the one most central to the story, was what could have been dismissed as a throw-away line. But at its heart, the perfect example of how simple words create a life of their own. It's when the teacher, Mr. Hori, casually, and quite un-seriously, remarks in the PE class about what it is to be a man. At its core, that's what the film is about, understanding who you are as a human, and accepting it on your own terms. Confusion, misinterpretation, familial and societal expectations of how someone must be, or act, or love, can turn them into the other, the strange, the monster. And the film is overflowing with empathy for all those who become afflicted in one way or another.If the film has one drawback, it's that the editing in the later stages of the film gets a bit loose. The time-jump and multiple perspective structure of the film works magnificently well for most of the film, but nearing the end, it does tend to drag a bit. But overall, a wonderfully engaging and skillfully produced film.",
        "One of my favorite types of movies are the ones that attempt to depict how children and adults fundamentally speak different languages, where the ultimate conflict of the movie comes from the ways in which children and adults struggle to understand one another. Now it's probably going to be a spoiler if you haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm talking about movies like Where is the Friend's House, where a boy takes an off handed comment from a teacher so seriously he legitimately believes his friend will get kicked out of school if he doesn't manage to deliver his friend's homework assignment that very night, and all of the adults around him failing to understand the urgency of what to him will alter the rest of his friend's life.Now as for why that simple comparison constitutes a spoiler, it's because Monster does the same thing as The Handmaiden in which we're given three different movies that flip the movie you thought you were watching on its head twice over, making you feel like a total moron over all of the epiphanies you had in part two as soon as the \"real\" real story is revealed by part three with a first part that makes you think you're watching something akin to Changeling, in which a worried mother tries to get to the bottom of what is happening to her son as she fights against gaslighting from state officials, then a second part that lures you into thinking that you're actually watching The Hunt, and a third part akin to Where is the Friend's House that shows you you're just watching a boy fundamentally incapable of communicating to the adults around him the situation that he's in with a friend of his whom he deeply cares about in a way that would make any sense to them, a clever inversion of one of my favorite sub-genres, in which children grow and learn by overcoming simple predicaments that the adults around them place them in.",
        "The story isnt that complex but the journey the film maker takes us on is complex, exaggerating along the way the opacity of the conundrums facing the subjects. Life is difficult, until you see the end result, so navigating life can be extremely taxing and frustrating. This movie is called Monster, meaning that assumptions are often the monsters that they lead us down painful paths, often unnecessarily.This is a deeply compassionate film. It requires an investment from the viewer but pays off handsomely in the end. This is a filmmaker who is improving with every release. Soon he will be in the same strata as Park Chan Wook.",
        "\"Monster\" stands as a cinematic storytelling marvel, a mesmerizing ballet that dances on the fine line between deception and revelation, leaving your heart suspended in a breathless waltz. Within this intricate narrative tapestry, we find a labyrinth of interconnected stories, each spun by unreliable narrators, threading together fragments of truth to form an intricate mosaic of human experience.In \"Monster,\" the narrative is a carefully woven tapestry of secrets, a suspenseful riddle that unravels slowly, like a skilled magician revealing the final act. In a world where falsehoods are the common currency, the truth is a rare and precious gem, hidden away.Under the masterful direction of Hirokazu Kore-eda, the young cast delivers performances that resonate like a soul-stirring sonnet, each line rich with genuine emotion, tugging at the heartstrings with a delicate touch. The film's humor, like a sudden burst of laughter in the midst of a storm, is a genuine surprise that casts a warm, playful light upon the tale. The cinematography is a masterful canvas, painted with the brushstrokes of natural light and the artful positioning of characters. Each frame is a work of art that captures the raw, unfiltered essence of life, evoking emotions that linger long after the final credits roll.Kore-eda's \"Monster\" is a profound exploration of innocence, bullying, perception, deceit, and the intricate nuances of human relationships. It peels back the layers, revealing that beneath the surface of every story lies a complex and poetic narrative, waiting to be uncovered, much like the layers of a timeless poem.Come follow me on Instagram at MovieFest UK (90k)",
        "Hmm, how do i say this. Monster... is a... mosaic. Mosaic of a broken souls that unfolds like an origami, each fold revealing a new facet of its intricately woven story.Kore-eda, a maestro of human narratives, weaves a tapestry of delicately observed moments. A grieving mom, bullied teen, connect with their school principal, in a delicate dance of shared burdens.The pacing is deliberate, allowing silences to resonate with unspoken emotions. It's not fast-paced, but the silences speak volumes about loss, hope, and the resilience of the human. The film's true monster isn't a physical entity, but the isolation and pain that can fester within us.Some may crave more answers, but the film's quiet beauty, nuanced, and raw."

    "Nana": [
        "Ok so we are introduced to two girls who have the same name but with different personalities. Nana K is like this whiney girl who finds it hard to find the right guy for her and she has sorta a diva attitude. On the other girl Nana O, she is considered a rock chick who is pretty chilled and quite a gorgeous girl. I thought the first episode with just the two of them together moving in was quite good as it was a clear intro on what the story was going to be about. However after watching the anime further, I realised it was pretty boring and it was only just filled with pointless nonsense drama. This anime reminds me of \"Skip Beat\" and \"Peach Girl\" by the drama involved including how it was presented. Nana K clearly has the resemblance of Momo and Kyoko in my personal opinon. The anime had even added in pointless character's too like I never am going to think Nana K would get hitched with Shouji. He is right to not be with a self absorbed b word lol. \nAnyways at least I only just watched 5 eps of this and nothing more. I'd be bored to tears with just watching 47 eps of this! I'm only giving this anime a 4/10 just because of the first episode but the rest, can go into a rubbish bin.....",
        "\"Say, Nana... Do you remember the first time we met?\"The lovely universe of \"Nana\" is introduced with these lines. Probably the most persuasive shoujo manga author ever is Ai Yazawa. Every lady can escape reality and immerse herself in romantic fantasies in this universe that she crafts with vivid, realistic people, amazing events, and a dash of music.The characters in \"Nana\" are among its best features; we can recognize ourselves in some of them and think that such a person could possibly exist. This is proof that you can make a good anime without the usual tsundere, moe or bothersome childhood buddy.Hachi's demeanor is one element, though, that I didn't enjoy. Her actions can be reprehensible at times. Mostly because, in contrast to the other characters, she has no goals or aspirations (apart from getting married, which is quite boring).Another one of Nana's strong suits is the story. Ai Yazawa put a lot of effort into making the setting as realistic as possible, aiming to elicit strong emotional responses from the reader.The plot has that magical quality that causes you to root for some characters unconsciously and feel some events almost as strongly as the characters themselves, even though it's a normal shoujo tearjerker (with a little music). The story's exposure of the harsh, unforgiving reality-one devoid of happy endings and pure love-is another admirable aspect of it. Yazawa-sensei provides her characters (particularly Hachi) a lot of imagination, although their reality is very similar to our own.The artwork wasn't all that outstanding. I find it annoying because every character is so tall and slender. Aside from that, I thought the artwork and story went really nicely together. There were several specifics about sunlight and shadows.For fans of shojo, Nana is an essential viewing position overall. It gives us a wealth of information about life and its struggles in addition to teaching us a valuable lesson about the mistakes we should never do.",
        "This is an anime that you have to watch. Especially if you like slice-of-life!\nThere are a lot of events that can makes you cry, laugh or even angry.\nAfter the first episode you'll be perplexed since this anime go backwards without some kind of warning, but after the first five episodes it will be all clear.\nThe animation is good but the drawings are quite bad, in my opinion. But you'll don't even bother since its history will capture you, totally.\nAnyway it's tragic, just to let you know.",
        "It is no exaggeration to say that \"Nana\", the animated Fuji TV/Madhouse Studio TV series, is perhaps one the best written anime dramas to come out in recent years. With is poignant, touching, sometimes funny but often bitter-sweet story, it has truly elevated Japanese anime from simply being \"otaku\" fanboy entertainment to mature, adult drama.Based on writer/artist Yazawa Ai's best selling \"Shojo\" (girl's) manga series which ran in the Japanese publication \"Cookie\" (Ribon), the 47 episode series is a story narrated in flashback by its two very different heroine leads.Osaki Nana (Paku Romi), a \"sexy tomboy beanpole\" singer who fronts the Japanese punk rock band \"The Blackstones\" (AKA Blast), wants nothing more than making it big as an entertainer. She and the band's talented guitarist Honjo Ren (Hidenobu Kikuchi) were longtime lovers since their garage band days in Hokkaido, up until Ren's fateful decision to leave Hokkaido for bigger opportunities in Tokyo, a move which literally broke Nana's heart. Two years later, wanting to follow her dreams of becoming a rock star, Nana decides to go to Tokyo as well to make a name for herself. By a chance coincidence she meets up with another young country girl who is also heading to Tokyo. The hopelessly cute Komatsu Nana (Kaori), with her long boots, girly wardrobe and giddy personality is the complete opposite of the brooding, dark and intense Nana O., yet by uncanny coincidence they share the same first name and age. Nana K. is heading to Tokyo to be with her boyfriend Endo Shoji (Takahashi Hiroki) who is going to art college there. Nana K. and Nana O. part ways when they get to Tokyo but soon find themselves reunited again while out searching for an apartment. The two agree to share a modest, flat which by kismet/serendipity is on the seventh floor (nana kai) and is numbered \"707\" (Nana Hyaku Nana). The two become instant friends and develop a special bond - Nana O even gives Nana K the pet name \"Hachi\" (a play on both the number eight and the famous loyal Akita dog Hachiko).Thus begins their exciting, chaotic, happy and sometimes heartbreaking adventures in Tokyo.Yazawa's original manga story is faithfully adapted by series director Asaka Morio (Card Captors Sakura, Gunslinger Girl) and beautifully retold in animation by Madhouse studios (Gunslinger Girl).Yazawa's hopelessly romantic story has all of the elements of teen soap opera or tear-jerking K-drama. Such mature themes like underage sex, prostitution, loyalty, betrayal, mental illness, adultery, tabloid scandal, pregnancy, love and friendship are are addressed in refreshingly candid and frank detail that doesn't talk down to its teen audience demographic. With its emphasis on music, fashion and hip youth culture, it is little wonder why it appeals and speaks to a generation bred on MTV, CW and trendy J-Dorama. At the heart of \"Nana\" is an interesting cast of characters, all of whom have equally compelling back stories.One of the most controversial sub-plots of the series involved the taboo romance between 15 year-old Shinichi (Ishida Akira) phenom bassist for Blast and 23 year old Japanese-American lead singer Serizawa Reira (Hirano Aya) of Blast's rival band \"Trapnest\" (Tora-Nesu). Their romance, while somewhat scandalous, is told with almost poignant and deep affection. Underage/Lolita romance (a dominant theme of Japanese Shojo manga) seems to be a recurrent theme in Yazawa's works including her recent \"Paradise Kiss\" - Hachi's past history included an adulterous relationship with an older man while still a teen. She loses her boyfriend to the petite Lolita-like Kawamura Sachiko (Kojima Megumi)and is also befriended by the genteel,junior high school cosplay enthusiast and Blast mega-fan, Uehara Misato (Kanai Mika).Friendship is also a strong thematic element in \"Nana\". Nana and Hachi certainly share a strong friendship and bond and as the story progresses that friendship further strengthens despite a falling out between the two over Hachi's affair and pregnancy by Tora-Nesu guitarist Takumi (Morikawa Toshiyuki). Nana O's relationship with her band is also given much insight particularly with stoic leader and fledgling attorney Yasu (Kawahara Yoshihisa) who harbors a crush on Nana O. and Terashima Nobuo (Tomokazu Seki) heir to a famous family business. Nana O's own romantic storyline with rebel Honjo Ren (Kiuchi Hidenobu) is touching and one can't help but want to have them hook up and be happy.The music is another highpoint in the series complements of two very different singing talents - Anna Tsuchiya, the Eurasian model/singer whose hard hitting, rock n' roll style is reminiscent of Joan Jett and Oliva Lufkin, the Okinawan Japanese-American singer whose powerful vocals style evokes comparisons to singers like Mariah Carey and Kelly Clarkson. Their music complements the tone of the anime and adds emotional impact to storyline.While Madhouse's animation is in tune with the manga, some may find the frequent shifts from serious anime style to highly stylized, cartoonish and \"goofy\" pop art a bit irritating, although it did help to break some of the more somber and serious moments. The series ending was a bit abrupt and contrived and seems to deviate from both the endings of the live-action adaptation with Nakashima Mika and Yazawa's original manga. I can't say that I liked the anime ending as it seemed very unsatisfying although there are talks that a second series is in the works to resolve this.Like other anime \"soap operas\" like \"Maison Ikkoku\" or \"Touch\", \"Nana\" succeeds because it refuses to be pigeonholed as just being anime and strives to use the medium of animation to tell a mature storyline that is certainly not for children but is bold and touching enough for adults.",
        "Nana is a series, where you get to really know each and every character with their flaws and strengths. If it's love or hate, you really understand them because they are so well fleshed out.It makes them feel so real that every interaction between them hits you hard, if it's in a happy, funny or sad way, often it's devastating.All that is only possible with the brilliant character writing from Ai Yazawa.The songs are phenomenal and how they integrated them in the openings/endings is wonderful.I can only hope that the story will continue and find its conclusion someday.One of my all time favorites.",
        "Some works of art can be tragic, yet amazing. Their lack of a happy ending can hit close to home, or emphasize a real truth about this world. Nana did not hit that sweet spot. Its a downer of a series - but isn't evocative enough. Its too happy and slow to be a drama, too merciless to be a romance or slice-of-life.I liked the characters. I fell in love with our two Nanas from the first episode. I wanted them to succeed, and find real love. I knew they would go through a lot of trials and self-discovery, but I was excited for the journey. I sat through episodes, each slightly less cheerful than the last. The romances became less passionate, the Nanas more distant. I was eagerly waiting for the day things all came together.Nope. I'm not that lucky. The world in Nana freaking sucks. People only grow apart. They don't learn their lessons, they don't overcome their difficulties, they don't have solid, healthy relationships. It is a downward spiral, so subtle that, by the time you realize the descent, you're 20+ episodes in.But again, its not major enough to call it a tragedy. It just winds up melancholic. I ended up disliking everyone for not being mature enough to solve their issues. In real life, I'd expect more effort. I can't take away anything from this show.I know some people can relate more to this anime than I can. Congrats. But it left me cold and empty. No powerful emotion, no new insight, wishing for the opposite. This show bites.",
        "Call it as it is two best friends move in together. One of them a serial dater who keeps dating guys in and out and the other a rock star. They build a good bond but it goes as far as just being platonic. I'm going to be the one to have the courage to say it. This is known as bait anime. I'll call it as it is. It lures lgbt audience to ask what if? What if they actually became a romantic couple they had everything to make it work but somehow they just couldn't because they were straight all along. I got annoy with Nana #2 not the rockstar because she knew what she wanted in life. She mature and little annoying nana I don't think she will ever settle.",
        "Nana is the best anime in its genre. Nothing will ever top the emotion poured into this show, and did I mention that it has the most beautiful soundtrack? I still listen to all the songs six years later.",
        "This one is good guys =) I had never heard of this when I started watching and didn't know what I was in for.I'm currently on episode 28 and it's awesome. Every episode leaves you wanting more. I really can't say anything bad about this one because the animation is interesting and beautiful, the music is rocking, the voice acting is perfect and the plot is very deep, subtle, shocking and suspenseful. Also, there are so many laugh out loud moments and you really start to care about these characters.Summary------- Two girls both with the same name and age meet unexpectedly and become roommates in Tokyo whilst chasing their dreams. The interesting thing is that they are polar opposites but somehow fit together like a glove.One is strong, proud and independent while the other is the opposite but oh how their characters learn, grow and change.I don't want to give away anything so that bare summary is just 5% of the depth of this Anime.I recommend this to adults as there are many serious themes covered. Despite that this one is just plain fun and addicting to watch. You never feel preached to.What else can I say......give this one a good chance (at least 3-5 episodes before making any judgments).Also, I must mention that the music is very good as well. We have music by Anna Tsuchiya (first op. third ending) and Olivia Lufkin (first ending, second op. second ending). Both are popular rock singers in Japan so the music is top-notch.I haven't enjoyed an anime series this much since Hunter X Hunter (my all-time favorite).",
        "Even though this show had drama from the beginning to end (which I thoroughly enjoyed) I was so disappointed with the ending. How could a shows ending be abandoned in the way 'Nana' was? We had no clue where the hell Nana was to the point where when the episode finished, I went to find the next one only to find that it was THE LAST ONE. It was so great and I finished it so quickly but just that last episode.. how could you not explain why one of the major characters wasn't there?? \nOverall a great show full of drama and also hilariously funny BUT the ending severely ruined it for me.",
        "Nana was so great! in the first couple of episodes, but once we see her boyfriend cheat on her it just goes down hill from there. It feels like nothing progress from there, it just ends up being a crappy romance, that ends up leaving you upset and frustrated, the ending of Nana was probably one of the worst endings in anime period. I hate how it ends up leaving you unsatisfied. I came for the beginning but couldn't handle watching another episode. I genuinely enjoyed nana but the ending just absolutely destroyed it for me, and that is something I can't ignore. :(((",
        "Nana is one of those anime that begin-just phenomenally but turn out to be an unexpected failure, which is really disappointing because this anime gives you such high hopes, but then destroys every shred of it at the end. Yes, while it may be realistic and mature, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's good. I think this anime is a bit overrated, considering its probably one the worst anime endings ever. The conclusion-there is none, the romance is confusing and overwhelming, the drama was okay but was ultimately destroyed with that ending. The anime could've been a nice sweet anime to watch but it ultimately decided to be terrible and melancholic. So please reconsider this anime, you'll be disappointed.",
        "To everyone telling the ending wasn't good: This isn't even an ending, it's just the mid part of the anime. This show needs a season 2 to answer many questions of audience.Now to enjoy this show thoroughly, you must read manga so you will understand what ending is going to lead to(coz manga was halted halfway due to writer's health issues). Only some chapters feel missing in manga and many things seem to be sorted out. Go watch this anime, read manga and you will have experienced one of the most mature and realistic show.",
        "Those who are impressed by this anime seem to have lack of reading books or having real life. Its just like you are listening to a random person's story.Weak story, too many predictable events and dialogues, too many useless unrelated dialogues which seems are just made to fill a chapter... I think those who rate it high are new to world of anime or they have not read many books.Characters are change into another complete different persona sometimes as if writer changed for some parts.I wanted to quit on episode 3 but I read reviews so I watched till 10 and lets say I never been bored this much.",
        "I love nana so much. What a powerful message. I watched it at quite a young age which I regret because I learned thing from this show that are realistic and sad. This show made me sob more than I needed to. So many emotions in one anime.",
        "When most people watch anime, they want the typical action adventure underdog shonen plotline. If your like most guys and only like the mainstream stuff then this isn't your cup of tea. No. Nana is the cup of coffee I need every morning. This show is an emotional rollercoaster. As the first few episodes will give you more into the characters background and later on it gets more and more intriguing. I'll admit it was painful to watch because it was so realistic. Yes, you might get annoyed with hachiko for being dependent and clingy but I'll admit I do know girls that are like that. Nobody's perfect. We all have flaws. What do most of us in our 20s do? Smoke, drink, breakups. Nana does perfect that. There aren't much anime like Nana. Thats because most romantic dramas get adopted to live action series because its more suited to real life or it just stays as manga series only.",
        "I initially thought this series wasn't bad, and I would definitely rewatch it again if I could, but still, there are some things which I would develop, for example the main plot, it seemed interesting and not too sad in the start, however after a bit it started to feel heavy and kind of dark making the series hard to watch...\nI still believe it is worth a watch tho!",
        "Nana, in my opinion, is the best slice of life anime there is.\nThe story is incredibly realistic and you can actually see yourself in some of the characters. Not to mention the impeccable songs the anime produced.\nFor sure a must watch and one of those animes i will always hold close to my heart.",
        "It's a great anime I totally agree. But it in the the remind one is broken heart. I wish I hadn't seen it because it hurts me so much. I really really feel sorry for nobu\ud83d\ude2d if you don't want to break your heart don't watch it it'll be better.",
        "This is such a great show! I had first read a few manga of Nana and then became very excited to hear that they made it into a TV show. It's a show that I can easily relate to the main character Nana Komatsu. This may contain spoilers.... . . . . . . . . . . . . . The ending of the show really left me with a lot of questions. I am in the process to see if there are more manga than episodes so that I can further my answers. Just be prepared to be left a little upset after you watch the show because its so frustrating that there are so many unanswered questions!!!! I will try to post anything more if I find more out for you viewers!! Can't wait.",
        "A really good TV Series, grabs your attention, you feel the emotions BUT ending fells incomplete and you want to know what will happen next and trust me you don't want to end up feeling like that in the end. Unless this TV Series makers decide to make a follow-up episodes (After episode 47), I will not recommend this TV Series to anyone.",
        "I fell in love with Nana just a couple of episodes into the show. It was beautiful, and more complex and mature than most other animes I've come across. It's hard to not fall for the two main protagonists. And it's hard to choose between them. Both have their own flaws, and their own strengths. Each might seem to be the polar opposite of the other, but both our Nanas love each other, and get along perfectly, contrary to our expectations. And the love they have for each other makes the viewers fall for them even deeper.All the characters are well-written. Each has a backstory that's revealed in bits and parts as the anime progresses. And none of the side-characters FEEL like side-characters even with the lack of screen time because they're all so well-written and complex and real enough. And all their lives turn out to be more interconnected than we'd expect.Each episode leaves you wanting more.\nThe story gets more intricate amd complex, untill you find yourself staring at one glorious mess of a plot.And then, perhaps, it goes downhill.\nYou'd expect for character development. You'd think the strong flawed characters you fell in love with will atleast not give in without a fight. But they just disappoint you, in a way. Miscommunication, the tension of hurtful words once said, the absence of understanding between the characters, the lack of effort on their parts to mend things, everything results in a lonely bitter mood towards the end of the anime.Nobody expected this to be a fairytale. Nobody assumed there'd be a happy ending. But... The ending was too heart-breaking. It shows the characters settling for the bitter surprises life throws at them. Accepting bad outcomes. Not properly trying to fix anything. Not even in the name of love, or friendship, or for the sake of old sweet memories they made together.Basically, according to me, it was a story where \"nobody lived happily ever after.\"\nBut perhaps, if the manga is continued, we might get a more satisfying ending.\nNevertheless, I am so glad I watched this series. It's beautiful in a way I never thought anything could be.\nAnd it strikes closest to home. Being as realistic, and imperfect, as the ending is...",
        "All time favorite. It's the most realistic romance anime, and all tho i hate all the romance animes or series, this is another level!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Everyone should watch it, it changed my perspective to a lot of things, and I love it.",
        "The show has excellent characters, who are all well rounded and fleshed out. Generally, they all have distinct and interesting chemistry.Unfortunately, this is very much a product of its time (accepted conservative culture of the 90s/2000s) : there is a lot of casual sexism and very staunch female gender roles present. For me, I tolerated this up to about the 2/3rds way mark before I had had enough, because the show threw extreme pro-lifism into the mix too. It is strange to think that a show about a punk band would have such strong conservative tendencies, but the author's viewpoint on certain parts of society rather clearly shines through.If you can stomach the conservative tendencies of the show, the actual character dynamic is great, and well done.",
        "A well done adaptation of Ai Yazawa's manga(comic) \"Nana.\" It's about two girls named Nana rooming together in Tokyo in order to fulfill their respective dreams. Nana Komatsu (Hachi) moved in order to be closer to her boyfriend Shoji. Hachi's dream is to become a good housewife. Nana Osaki's dream is to become successful with her punk band \"blast.\" I find the anime enjoyable. Even though it's supposed to be for girls, it doesn't include all clich\u00e9 of most girl anime's. Its mostly about friendship, and the hardships of knowing and finding what you want.There's two decent live action movies out.A plus is the opening theme song is pretty good, and there are a lot of rock themes throughout the anime."

    "Darker Than Black": [
        "When I started watching this series on Funimation's YouTube Channel I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not but by the time I'd watched half a dozen episodes I was hooked, indeed I liked it enough to buy the series on DVD; at no point while watching the remaining episodes did I regret my purchase.The world of 'Darker than Black' is different to our own; two meteorites have struck Earth, one in South America and the other in Tokyo. Around the impact sites two areas knows as Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate appeared. Fives years previously something happened in South America and Heaven's Gate disappeared along with the surrounding land; people are worried that the same will happen in Tokyo. The Gates aren't the only strange things; some people have become 'contractors', people with strange powers who kill each other and other people. There is however a price to pay, each time a contractor uses his power he must pay a price; one must smoke despite hating cigarettes, another must eat and one must break a finger. The story follows one of these; a Chinese student called Hei, he is part of an organisation called the Syndicate. He was somehow involved in the Heaven's Gate incident and the authorities fear that something similar will happen in Tokyo.There is an interesting array of characters besides Hei; he frequently works with Yin, an enigmatic and apparently emotionless girl; Huang, the human member of the team and Mao who is trapped in the body of a cat. As well as the Syndicate there is a policewoman who is investigating the contractors and a group from MI6 whose motives are unknown at first. The series is not as dark as the series suggests but it is a lot of fun; combining mystery, action and a touch of humour in an entertaining way. The animation looks good with good character designs and flowing movement. While it isn't too violent there is some which is quite bloody making it unsuitable for younger viewers although I doubt it would appeal to them anyway.",
        "This series is set a couple of years after the original; if you want to know what happened between the two series you need to watch the four OVA episodes; strangely these are on disc three of the 'Season Two' box set, at least they are here in the UK. The series starts in Russia where thirteen year old Suo lives with her father and twin brother Shion until one day their house is attacked. She assumes they have been killed in the attack and heads to Japan hoping to find her mother. She is accompanied by Hei, who has been badly affected by the loss of Yin, Mao who is now a flying squirrel and a doll called July. It turns out that Suo is a contractor; she can create an antitank rifle out of thin air! There are several contractors after her including one of her school friends who has the power to summon enough insects to kill a person or even derail a train! While Suo wants to find her mother Hei is keen to find Yin again; the problem is many people want to stop him believing a prophecy that suggests if they meet again it could be the end for all contractors.While this series is quite different to the first I enjoyed it just as much; Suo makes a good protagonist and the season contains one long story arc rather than relying on several three or four part stories. While only a few original characters return it is good to see Hei, policewoman Misaki Kirihara, although she is now working for the shadowy 'Section Three, and Mao return. Over the course of the series Suo's character develops nicely and that development includes a couple of real surprises that I won't spoil here.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "I cannot say this is a classic anime TV-Series, but its one which had me glued to me seat through two season and an OVA. I normally class everything using simple classifications, A: I can re-watch it and enjoy every minute. B: I can watch it and love it, but on a re-watch it's a struggle. C: I can get to the end in the first watch, but it's a struggle and D: I cannot complete a first watch. This sits at the lowest rank of A. The main pull is the mystery, why is Hei so different from the other contractors is the main mystery as well as what has happened to the earth and what is the Syndicate. Some of the other characters are excellent as well, the November 11 and April characters are great and I really felt for them. Misaki Kirihara is good as well and you really hope she becomes Hei's friend, if not lover. Finally Yin and Mao are excellent as well, with Mao providing the comic relief. This is no Ghost in the Shell, buts its reasonably close. I would most certainly advise anyone to watch it. Note, while the description seems silly, this is anyone but. This is an adult anime with adult themes, but nothing too gross, so all the family can enjoy it.",
        "Unfortunately, \"Darker than Black\" really disappointed me.I think the character design of the main character and the fight scenes are nice to look at, but apart from that the anime doesn't really have a story. You have 1 or 2 aspects that are picked up again and again and the main character also has a personal goal, but that is rarely mentioned.The majority of season 1 actually consists of showing different \"missions\", each of which consists of 2 episodes.I didn't see the second season anymore because I had to fight my way through the first one and even fans of the first season say the second season is much weaker.Originally I only wanted to give 6/10 points, but I'll give it one more because season 1 has found a more or less satisfying ending.",
        "This is what the American series Hereos could have been like if it was written for adults.It features super-powered people who are real people, their powers come at a real price and not a token moral price as is used in children's comics.The story unfolds gradually with us getting to know more of the main character's back story from episode to episode.The powers are interesting as is the background of fear and manipulation and the fact that it finishes is one series rather than dragging on to squeeze extra money out of the idea is appealing.The plot is intelligent with no bad or annoying episodes and the ending is surprising and consistent, there is a small bit of comic relief but this is a dark story.I hadn't watched any anime in years but this one dragged me in from the first episode and I didn't regret it.",
        "I'm honestly quite conflicted about Darker Than Black. While the overall premise is interesting and fairly unique, I found the first half of Season One utterly unremarkable. I did not manage to connect to the characters (partially because most of them are 'Contractors' who don't have any emotions are thus as vivacious as wet cardboard) and found the plot mildly entertaining at best. Funnily enough, while the series was mediocre, it was at least consistently so: I rated every episode a 7/10; none were particularly outstanding, neither in a positive nor in a negative way.Thankfully, the second half of the first season finally turned into a consistent story, and the final quarter is truly outstanding. Why the rest of the season wasn't written in the same way, I'll never understand.Season Two is a complete change of pace. The protagonist switches from a cold-hearted mercenary in his twenties to a preteen girl, yet becomes much darker in the process. Funnily enough, I found it much easier to emotionally connect to that preteen girl (perhaps because she had actual emotions), and the entire season features a consistent plot that advances with every episode. While not every episode is consistently fantastic, the second season of Darker Than Black is at least consistently entertaining.Then there is the final \"movie\", a four-part OVA. That one is solid gold. Set between the two seasons, it finally explains how the drastic shift in tone and characters of Season Two came to place.In my opinion, the production value mirrors the quality of the storytelling. I was not particularly impressed by the animation, dialogues, or even soundtrack (despite being written by Yoko Kanno) in the first half of Season One, but I felt like it became much better later on. Season Two and the OVAs are great in every regard. I watched the English dub, which is good throughout the entire series.All in all, I'd recommend Darker Than Black if you don't mind sticking through the first twelve or so episodes. If you're looking for instant gratification, perhaps you should look somewhere else.",
        "I love this series. I'm someone who is always on the lookout for anime productions that aren't too weird and wacky, with ridiculous \"fan service\" and silly storytelling. This show fits the bill: it takes itself seriously and has a \"Western\" feel, in a similar fashion to other anime I enjoy like \"Baccano!\" and \"Cowboy Bebop.\" Highlights include:-A phenomenal English dub - simply one of the best I've EVER heard. Every character is perfectly cast. Special commendations must go to John Swasey as the grizzled badass Huang and Jason Liebrecht as the befuddled Chinese exchange student-by-day, cloak-wearing electric-powered masked hitman-by-night named Hei. As Hei's daytime identity Li Shenshun, Liebrecht channels friendliness and warmth; as Hei, Liebrecht gives the character both a mysterious apathy and a subtle, smoldering anger that crackles underneath the surface of his personality like the electricity his body generates to assassinate targets.-A fascinating setup, where part of Tokyo is taken over by a bizarre spatial anomaly and the world's intelligence agencies employ individuals with X-Men-like abilities to do their dirty work; each time these contractors use their supernatural abilities they have to \"pay the price\" in some fashion, whether through an OCD-style tick or some form of self-harm.-Great side characters, including a variety of MI-6 operatives from the UK, one of whom is probably one of my favorite anime characters ever: the suave, sarcastic blond British hitman/contractor named Jack Simon, codenamed November 11. Troy Baker gives such a great performance.-A wonderful narrative arc during the first season, whereby each fascinating member of the main cast, which also includes detectives with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and a private detective named Guy Kurasawa, is given an episode focusing solely on them. This is an anime with very strong episodic writing; there's a lot of emotion to be found in the stories of these mysterious, broken individuals, and it's one of the only anime series I've ever seen that actually earns its angst.There's a second season too, which isn't as good as the first and introduces new characters. The first season is where it's at. This is an anime to treasure and savor - one of my absolute favorites.",
        "Every time I watch this, I want to add another star. It's a shame it stops at 10. There's so many layers of genius on this, I don't know where to start. The characters are so varied, yet I can identify with each of them. As different from our world as this one is, it's crazily so similar, and the reasons why are so brilliant and logical. For instance, if we lost our ability to see the stars, how many normal people would actually care? It's cutting, how deep that simple point hits.The only bad part for this entire series is how quickly it ends. This needs 10 seasons, and it gets 2.5. I just keep rewatching instead of going to something of lesser quality. Help.",
        "I think it was Vonnegut who said their are only 12 story arcs, it's just a matter of how well you tell them. This show brilliantly smashes them all, while developing characters in unconventional ways. A mysterious alien presence grants powers to seemingly random individuals, with a certain price for said power. What's brilliant is how little people care for reality, and willingly settle for the propaganda. For instance, the stars are replaced with different stars, but how often does the average person even look up at night? It's a trivial rearrangement for most people, despite the cosmic implications. \"Contractors\" and \"dolls\" have some solid stereotyping, yet we see distinct moments where those stereotypes are both true and false. Couple this with emotional events that span entire lifetimes, and a myriad of brilliant characters, and I find myself just rewatching and rewatching.Oh, and it really helps that the animation is brilliant, and the dubs are flawless. It seems they spared no expense on this, and I sorely wish it were revisited by the original crew.",
        "The first few episodes are a bit, wtf is going on but it does explain more in depth after several episodes. This show is basically about emotionless people with abilities that have to pay a price to use those abilities and vary greatly person to person. This show is a sorta dark show, i guess compared to what everyone these days thinks of a \"normal\" anime then yeah it is dark, but to me I've seen much darker lol. There is lots of blood, action, and excitement. My only complaint with season 1 was the last episode(26). I believe it was an OVA but none the less it just didn't match the series at all, for example episode 1-25 is pure logical thinking, no emotion to killing a person for what ever reason they have to kill them. In episode 26(it also takes place before episode 25 id say 23-24)the group of contractors(basically assassins) are all OMG BUDDY YOU CAN'T KILL THAT PERSON YOU COULD GET HURT!?! Its far to dangerous, don't do that, Oh my goodness thank god your OK. It basically just changes there personalities 100% of what they've been for 25 episodes and doesn't make cents lol Other wise season 1 was very good.Now onto season 2, right off the bat i'd say its far less dark, theirs still tons of violence and blood but unlike in season 1 there is a lot of hesitant killing or mercy for the opponents which doesn't really match up with season 1 but it's still very good overall. When i was a little over half i felt i liked season 1 better but after i got finished(includes the 4 OVA episodes, this basically wraps up a ton of questions and explains the gist of season 2) i definitely like season 2 a little bit better. Overall review: 4.5/5 Why not a 5/5, well there are some serious questions that could have been given at least a vague detail.(like payments, and what happens when there not made. Or how they even know what there payments are). There are plenty other questions but this is just one example. I also think there is plenty of room for a 3rd season, because with all the things they left blank theirs more then enough room to do another season possibly two, i really hope they do i wouldn't mind at all! But don't misinterpret what i said about blanks, the series ends very good with a lot of questions but not enough that it makes the show not make cents or bad in anyway.The show is worth the watch :)",
        "This anime series has a brilliant premise, interesting characters, great animation, music and sound effects, engaging action scenes and well written dialogue. It would seem that those would constitute a great anime show. Well, Darker than Black is good but it could have been a lot better, if one thing wasn't missing: Character development. With the exception of episode 13 and 14 (the best ones, in my opinion) where we see a subtle, yet clear enlightenment of the side character Yin, there is very little character development in this series. The great titles like Death Note, Elfen Lied, Time of Eve or even the lighthearted Black Lagoon, always feature an emotional arc of one or more characters. They learn, they react, they change their attitude or moral stance because of the circumstances. We root for the characters, we empathise with them and we get closure when their character arc completes. This is missing in Darker than Black. The main character is conflicted but his attitude and behaviour stays almost constant throughout.If not for the above, this would have been an outstanding series. As it is, it's still worth watching, but don't expect the thoughtful and emotional involvement that the best anime give.",
        "The anime's story is interesting and unique, the animation is great as well.Unfortunately the protagonists remain somewhat flat and uninspiring, the beginning of the show feels very \"rushed\" and confusing. The audience is just tossed into this world without pretty much any explanation until later episodes about what \"Hell's Gate\" actually is or even looks like which was kinda annoying to be honest.Instead of providing the really interesting elements or focusing more on the supernatural powers and happenings the creators decided to add quite a few boring filler episodes with a totally irrelevant side story and boring characters towards the later midsection of the show as well. Those felt totally unnecessary and almost made me stop watching the show since it felt like such a waste of time at that point.Overall I didn't hate the show and watched it all the way through but quite frankly: I would probably not recommend it to anyone over other great shows that are in the same genre but just more superior in the way of story telling and action.5/10",
        "I like the uniqueness of the story of this anime. This anime is full of mystery but in some aspect I feel bored because of some boring conversation in some episode. The animation of this anime is good because they used some HD graphics on it. But the color and the style of the anime is like old school.The plot of this anime is kinda creepy. not totally creepy. It gives me creeps because of my excite on what's next.. In episode 2-5 I ask to myself that what is a doll or contractor. they didn't deeply explain some unknown words in the anime so that some of the audience gets confuse.I recommend this anime if you are looking some psychological, mystery and paranormal anime.",
        "Some titles are misleading, as such is 'Darker than Black'; though the series is graphic throughout, the story is considerably less 'dark' than many other of anime. I cannot really 'genre' it either; there are elements of the supernatural which are used so for 'Darker than Black' to feel very much like a super-hero story (I can't really stress that though). It's another sort of anti-hero tale which I can suppose one may even compare with 'Death Note'; again, it's a little less 'dark' than most other anime ('Death Note' included), and of the anti-hero concept used, the show uses it without abusing it. The show also has such stereotypical characters, but I can say that these characters do the subject matter justice (the character of Hei dose not seem totally without reason to be angsty). The subject matter in question is thoughtful and it fuels very interesting conflicts. This is a decent series and I suggest that any fan of anime (or of the TV show 'Heroes') should give this overlooked series an attempt.7/10",
        "I got into Darker Than Black because of its creators- Tensai Okamura has made some real nice works before, notably Wolf's Rain. In that series, he also worked with Yoko Kanno, the composer of some of the best soundtracks I have heard in my life, most importantly Cowboy Bebop. However, this series isn't as good as those mentioned earlier, but it is still good.The problem with DTB is that it starts bad. It's just confusing, we don't know what's going on and we don't know the characters, so it's hard to care about them. Not only that- what I expected that would save the series, the music (I believe that music is as fundamental as anything else) wasn't that great either. Kanno's music just didn't stand out, and even the opening and closing themes weren't hers.However, if you have patience, there's a point where we get to know the characters. Some story arcs get really interesting and when a episode ends, you will want to see the other to know what is going to happen. And it gets fun and turns out to be a nice experience. However, I would only recommend it to anime fans- not the general public. There's still a lot more series in the same vein of DTB that are much better and you should see them before this one.",
        "Let me start by saying, that many people will usually consider this \"great\" anime, simply due to the many years of hype and the studio backing it. Sporting some decent songs produced by the famous Yoko Kanno helps as well. With that knowledge alone, people will usually be expecting something the likes of Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo. Unfortunately the biggest expectations usually tend to let us down quite frequently.As far as anime goes, Darker than Black is one that takes few risks and offers very little rewards. While you might hear or see that the series is \"gritty\" and \"gory\", it only really shares those two in very specific scenes and easily gets beat by other animes such as Elfen Lied, and while Datker than Black isn't here to give us a gore fest, it still provides with some decent scenes. The bad side?, they really only come sparingly.Many categorize the series as Noir or the abruptly formed, \"neo-noir\", and as a fan of such classics as Casablanca, The Big Sleep, and Gilda. I can't say I see it. Wearing a mask and a black trench coat, does not a noir make. There are zero silhouette shots, no femme fatales and the only person that smokes happens to be an uninteresting geezer with a bad case of the Mondays.The first few episodes are pieced together quite well, but eventually, the plot hits a fork in the road and becomes more about mysteries wrapped in enigmas, rinsed and repeated till they become clich\u00e9. At around this time two episodes usually contain the same plot as the director decided he needed two episodes to conclude a very short story.Ultimately, the characters aren't appealing and the lead (Hei) becomes as stiff as the rest of the cast. The character development is sluggish if at all any. Even the slapstick characters seem to just fall short. The fight scenes are worth the wait, but suffer from quick panels and don't really bring us in on the ride.Darker then Black feels average, I can't say I will recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys either Noir or animes altogether. Frankly, its too sub par to be considered \"good\", and in an age where the \"next big thing\" is still being wished for, DBT isn't even a tease.",
        "What really won me over in this anime is the main protagonist, Hei. I would go that far and say that he is one of my favourite protagonists of all the anime I've seen. I've read reviews of people describing him as a flat character, but in my opinion he's a very complex and mysterious being, that you really want to learn more about. The show follows the same logic with Cowboy Bebop and doesn't give you much information about him or the other cast members, but chooses a few specific episodes to reveal more about them and their past. You might feel confused cause you're gonna be keep in the dark for the most part, but I guarantee you will enjoy the episodes either way. A bonus of this show is the music. There are a few tracks that I'm certain will hit you in the feels and get stuck into your head for days.. It's a show that I can easily say that I want to rewatch, so something right must have been done on that part.For me, the drawback of the show was that I didn't get enough. I felt there was so much story that could have been told and left unsaid.. Also the second season, while good, paled in comparison with the first one. It had a different vibe and the protagonist became a supporting character, which was disappointing for me, cause I was really attached to his character and I was expecting for the sequel to be mainly focused on him again. Still we get development on his character, but personally I wouldn't mind if the series stopped at the first season. It doesn't feel incomplete and it can stand as show on its own.",
        "The story takes place two years after darker than black. The feeling is no longer the same. After finishing the first series, people would want to check the sequel out. I would recommend watching the four ova's first before watching the sequel. For those of you who haven't seen Ryusei no Gemini and loved the original and its main character, i have some bad news for all of you out there. As much as it looks that Hei is the main character, he is actually not. This series does involve Hei and completely explains the gap that has been left in the original and the ova's,however, Hei is only the supporting character. The story is actually about this Russian girl who is the copy of her brother. Her brother is a contractor since birth and has the ability to make things out of nothing. Somehow that involves making copies of anything. Due to certain events getting unfolded, She ends up traveling with Hei,who is searching for Yin,toward Tokyo to find her brother who is secretly creating another world in which his sister can live in. That is practically the importance of the series.But like i said. It does explain a lot more and ends the series in a happy tone. 6.5 out of 10 and no more sequels please :)",
        "I'd give a 8.5 if I could. This anime has one of the most cool characters I've seen in anime, Hei. The dude's attitude carries this show, but that's not to distract from the other characters. All of the main four, even the girl who rarely says a thing (I really enjoyed the episode focused on her) are a blast.The series is done in hour long vignettes, something not normally done in anime... and it takes the creators a little bit to get used to it. The first 7 or so episodes of this show were average and forgettable, but give DTB time and it finds it's place. Keep in mind, the beginning episodes are still necessary viewing for the mood and background it sets. So is the beginning rough? Yes. 7.9 worthy? Hell no! I know many a anime viewer such as myself who see's a score under a eight and thinks the show is a pass, but listen up. DTB IS NOT A PASS. This shows has everything to love in a anime and the ending WILL leave you satisfied. I love these characters, I feel the thought in the writing, it is complex and has a philosophical message. This one moment near the end delivers some of the best symbolism I've seen. Truly this show is a powerhouse; a world in it's own. Even characters who come in for a few episodes have a grand purpose in the study of Hei. Do not miss this show, it will have a impact on you and entrance you in pure coolness. 8.5/10",
        "I ran across this by chance and was immediately hooked. Its starts out slowly developing the characters, plot and slowly introducing backgroundThis is an adequate amount of action, humor and a bit of childishness, which may be possibly Japanese culture humor?In any case, the choreography of the fight scenes, the character development, the background, the pretense each characters flaws, etc are spot on in my opinion.I won't go into much detail in regards to the series, suffice to say there is a good deal of fighting, dying and blood letting. The premise is that some cataclysmic event caused the whole scenario to start....present day Japan is the timeline basically..Humans-Contractors-Dolls, those are the three classes of society, whilst the first class, humans, is not supposed to really know the contractors and dolls exist. I suggest buying all the series, getting a lot of popcorn..and watch them all back to back,then wonder why in the heck did they not make more episodes???",
        "This series is one of my all time favorites. if you're someone who doesn't easily connect dots however, it is not for you. the story is incredibly captivating without needing to give you much information. A lot of the story is left open and the characters are incredibly dynamic. You spend the entire series trying to solve questions like what happened? What does that mean? what will happen next? The directors have a keen understanding of setting, narrative and foreshadowing. The series is different than most anime, as you aren't given all the details in some drawn out boring exposition speech. You are left to connect events through meticulous clues and hopeful symbols left by the writers. An expert use of dialogue as there is very little dialogue that is worth nothing. Every word is important to the overall story. Perfect and thought provoking. Got more attached to the main 3 contractors than pretty much any anime characters.",
        "I came across this anime accidentally, I do not watch a lot of anime, in fact I rarely find an anime that I can truly say I enjoyed immensely, but Darker than Black is definitely an exception to this.I will admit after the first episode I wasn't completely convinced. It was vague and left me feeling a little jilted, but I found out the series runs in a two episode story arc, so of course I was confused. I watched the second and was intrigued. I had to know what happened next. I kept watching and I was left with the same feeling of anticipation. The good kind of anticipation when you know something really satisfying is going to happen. Not only is the story great but the art and animation is fabulous. Very clean and smooth, the movements are fluid and fight scenes are very enjoyable to watch. The character designs are unique, even characters that look similar are distinct. The characters' designs are not the only good thing about them, they are also dynamic with their own personalities and almost every character is likable. I have to say it was actually the style of art that prompted me to watch this show, and it was a great decision on my part. Although the ending may seem vague and leave questions unanswered, don't worry, the is a sequel on the way. Overall, there is no lack of good things in this show. It is hard to describe which is something I find a good quality.",
        "This show hits many of the marks that would in hindsight classify it as a pillar in the anime genre. The show has character, style, atmosphere, and thrilling action sequences backed by a sleek killer soundtrack composed by none other than Yoko Kanno.The issue with the show, however, is it comes short on a couple different axis', those being a cohesive narrative and lackluster character development.While the shows starts off with episodic story arcs that finish and end per one to two episodes (which are imo the best parts about the show), around the second half of the season, the show then goes deep into this convoluted overarching narrative that in the end falls flat on it's face. By the finale, your left scratching your head at what had just happened exactly, as the show gives little time to dwell and explain what was happening. It's as if in Cowboy Bebop, the last 4 episodes they discover a plot that a government was trying to commit mass planetary genocide and they had to resolve this crisis in 3 episodes time.Hei is our lead man in this adventure, and while his stoic and mysterious nature is interesting, some episodes it felt as if he had no personality at all. During the end of the season, they recap on his past and why he holds animosity towards certain other characters, it felt as if one issue resolves while another is just left with more questions than answers.Overall, the show has all the style and character to get in the upper echelons of it's media contemporaries, but unfortunately falls short in mostly in substance and narrative focus.",
        "Darker Than Black is not an average anime. It has something special in it, the story, the characters, the music, the moral, and those feels. I have seen many anime over the years but, this ranks above every one of them. It is supernatural but it stay so close to reality that you get lost in it some how. \"Every step is taken at a price, regardless of feelings it has to be paid.\"It echos in my ears and make me reconsider my actions. Being an anime it describes all the emotions inside a person, what he has to do in order to make the right decision. It is truly remarkable. The dialogs are so meaningful that they make you think about thing. I will always remember what Hei said \"If you pretend to feel a certain way, The feeling can become genuine all by mistake.\" If you want to watch an anime, then i would definitely recommend you this. Darker Than Black?????? YES!!!! Evey life has something darker than black.",
        "This is probably one of my favorite shows. HEI IS A BEAST OF A CHARACTER. He is constantly switching personalities from that of a silly exchange student to the serious contractor he is which is so easily depicted by his eyes whenever he is done pretending to be happy they drain from all life and it really just makes you wanna curl up into a ball and do nothing forever. If you are looking for a show to really just give you an existential crisis then Darker than Black is your show. CHARACTER ATTACHMENT IS CRAZY. It is so deep as well as very smart and emotionally draining. After watching it for the first time I proceeded to show it to my sister who watched it in one day and was left with no idea what to do with life. This series is so dark (the title is very fitting) with the creator having no conscious which is what makes it so good. You will also find a huge attachment to the characters that remain constant and even those that are temporary. Only thing I wish was different was that there was more to watch, really an amazing show."

    "Sword Art Online": [
        "This anime, set in 2022, opens with teenager Kazuto Kirigaya logging into the virtual reality game 'Sword Art Online' he knows what to expect as he was one of the beta testers. Computer games have progressed to a stage where it feels as though the players are really in the world of the game they are playing but there is a surprise waiting for Kazuto, or 'Kirito' as he calls himself within the game; the creator has made a game where it is impossible to log out and to make matters even worse the player will be killed in the real world if they die in the game or if somebody tries to remove their VR headsets. They are told that the only way to be released from the game is for somebody to get to the hundredth level and defeat the final boss. Kirito is highly skilled tanks to his time in the beta game but even for him it won't be easy. In the game he befriends Asuna; a girl who is also highly skilled. As time passes they progress, some players die and others settle down to peaceful lives in the lower levels of the game. Eventually, after two years, they reach the final level but even after victory things don't go according to plan; only one of them awakens leaving the other trapped in another game created by a man who worked for the creator of Sword Art Online. If the two of them are to be reunited the one who was freed must enter the new game and overcome a more dangerous foe.I wasn't sure what to expect from this series but once I started watching I was soon drawn into the story. Kirito and Asuna were great protagonists if a little overpowered at times, the other characters were pretty good too; both secondary characters and those who only appeared for one or two episodes. The worlds they were trapped in were imaginative within the confines of the game styles they replicated; they were also beautifully designed and well animated. I cared about the protagonists and found myself worrying when they were in danger despite knowing they weren't going to kill off a main character at that point in the show. For the most part it is a good action adventure with plenty of sword fighting that is suitable for all but the youngest viewers but later on there are some scenes that are more disturbing; most notably when the antagonist attempts to rape a half-naked Asuna. Overall I'd say this series is well worth watching; if it gets a DVD release here I'd certainly be tempted to buy it.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "It is time for another series of Sword Art Online and once again is consists of two main stories. In the first half of the series Kirito is approached to enter a game called 'Gun Gale Online' to find and identify a character calling himself 'Death Gun'. When he kills another player that person dies in real life; something that is theoretically impossible. Once in the game Kirito befriends a girl called Sinon who initially mistakes him for a girl. She is a sniper in the game despite being traumatised by an incident involving a gun in the real world. As the story progresses they find themselves confronting 'Death Gun' and learn how he is able to really kill people\u0085 something that will put Sinon in real danger.In the second half of the series Sinon joins Kirito and his friends in Alfheim Online. They are no longer the main protagonists though; Asuna takes a more central role as she learns new skills and befriends a girl called Yuuki. It looks like their friendship may end as Asuna's mother believes she is spending far too much time on line and is threatening to stop her playing any more, believing her online friendships aren't real. As it turns out Asuna and Yuuki's friendship is threatened by something far more serious; on line Yuuki may be the best swordswoman in the game but in real life she is seriously ill.Having enjoyed the first series I wasn't sure I wanted more in case it wasn't as good. Thankfully this series was enjoyably too although, at least for the first story, is quite different. The Gun Gale world is much darker in tone and appearance than the original worlds and the use of guns is quite different\u0085 even if Kirito continues to use a sword like weapon. I really enjoyed this story. The second arc didn't grip me as quickly; there seemed no real danger as the group took on new bosses and gained skills; then, with the introduction of Yuuki, things get more emotional leading to a tear-jerking conclusion. Overall I'd say if you enjoyed the first series you should enjoy this too.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "If this anime was characterised as a romantic one, with a love story theme, it would have been just fine. But, instead of that, it lures you in with the whole game like adventure themed story, with a so so MC and some more than capable fellow players. The story unfolds with the MC helping hopeless girls out and eventually (actually in the middle of the anime) falling in love, getting married and playing happy family (all that in two episodes, wow!) After that, I just gave up. I don't want to come out as a hater, but nothing warns you that this won't be an action focused anime. At least, if his girl kept her whole strong female appearance it would have been a bit better. But she just was lessen down to a sidekick. So, 2 out of 10.",
        "From episode 1 to 14, I really enjoyed the medival vibe from this anime. I honestly wish it didn't have to have such a sudden shift of location for the players to be trapped into instead of ending at just the medical world. I mean they were meant to \"clear\" the game within the medival world and get out alive but instead, have to go to another world as well to actually get out. Its just really confusing and totally out of sync for me on that respect...Anyways putting that aside, Kazuto and Asuna were actually pretty good teammates. Kazuto is such an intelligent gamer and pretty much a likeable one too! Asuna is like the girl who takes whatever she gets and she's pretty much a badass as well! I honestly did not expect them to kiss at the end, normally in anime I know what couples are going to be matched up or should be matched up, not Kazuto and Asuna. I don't know what to say about them as such but good for them to being a couple lol!This anime was good to watch but the background setting in my opinon, shouldn't be all over the shop. That's the pretty much exact reason why I'm only giving this anime a 7/10...",
        "The anime is popular and has flaws, but it is enjoyable in my opinion. The pacing is off, with the beginning feeling rushed and time skips making it difficult to connect with characters. Some instances felt like the anime was trying to make the viewer care but failing hard. Some characters felt forgotten throughout the series, like Klein, who is introduced in the beginning and barely seen again. This happens frequently throughout the series, with emotional moments and dramatic events having little emotional impact. The main character seems to not care much about the events, and the emotional impact is minimal. Overall, the anime is not perfect but enjoyable for those who enjoy a good story.",
        "I've seen some episodes of this show, and I just don't find the Matrix-derived world inspiring. It's nicely done with the animation and all, but the story and characters just aren't that deep for me. To be fair they're serviceable nonetheless.If I want to watch lucid dreaming in sci-fi I want to see something exceptionally unique to that story's take on the mind. Inception's done this, The Matrix did it, and even non-specifically: Terry Gilliam's Brazil did this and that wasn't a story about the mind but insanity in a dystopian metropolis. The animation's nice and the intros are nice, but there's not too much outside those areas frankly. It's noble in its scenario and imagery and kudos to the filmmakers not pulling punches with the spectacle.This show, I watch for the visuals and not the story. Some nice stuff here and there and it does it's best to try and stand out from other anime's of its ilk.",
        "It is genuinely impressive on how many levels this show fails. It has become a reference point for bad writing. This is a story written by someone who has admitted to doing no research beforehand, and made by a company prone to reusing footage. It fails on so many levels, that its popularity doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Yes, this show was released around the time death games got popular, the animation looks slick to the very untrained eye, and a few worthless characters are killed early on to give a sense of danger to the whole thing, but I can't believe that it is still popular that it has already gotten spinoffs, movies, and other series. How are people still watching this mess?CharactersNone of the characters have any actual personalities, especially not the females. Pretty much all of the women onscreen are only on the show to serve as a love interest for Kirito or to draw the eye of anyone watching for the attractive anime girls. None of them have any personality other than some of them having hobbies, and having a hobby does not equate to having a personality. The side characters also don't serve any purposes, other than to propel the \"plot.\" The main character, Kirito, is mainly just a blank slate because the writer thought that being the most overpowered character ever written is a personality.PlotThe story of the first arc had some potential, but unfortunately is it very poorly executed. None of the characters act like gamers. All the characters are very weak. The villain has no motivation. The fights are terrible (just watch them without music, without the amazing soundtrack no-one would be defending those fights). There are countless filler episodes and very little plot progression. The game doesn't make sense as a game. There are a lot more problems, but the main thing is that the author can only give exposition in a bar or a cafe. Seriously, if you have seen this, think back to any time you heard a clunky speech of poorly-disguised exposition. Chances are, it took place in some kind of a restaurant, which is a pretty lazy way of conveying information to the audience. Also the villain HAS NO MOTIVATION FOR KILLING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.Now I'm going to talk more about the Fairy Dance arc. Some of the things I mentioned previously regarding filler, exposition, and fight scenes are also here, but the plot has some extra problems. Like incest. There is an incest subplot just thrown in there and the poor writing just makes it gross and uncomfortable. If there was better writing, if Kirito's cousin had a personality outside of wanting to bang him, and if she grew over the course of the arc as a person, then it could've worked I guess. Asuna, Kirito's \"wife\" from the first arc has been reduced from a poorly animated badass to a caged damsel in distress. The villain of this arc has motivations, making the finale slightly less anticlimactic than the first, but they make no sense. If you lay out everything that he's trying to do, and think about how government cooperations work, and everything anywhere near his plan, it makes no sense as to why or how he would do this. There's also an uncomfortable and unnecessary rape scene with tentacle monsters that doesn't make a lot of sense in context and doesn't need to be there. For some reason Kirito is now friends with a mass-murderer and can walk immediately after being bedridden for 2 years.There's a lot I don't want to get into about how NOT A GODDAMN THING MAKES SENSE, but this review would just end up even longer and there are plenty of video essays on YouTube that go into more depth in much more entertaining manners.Sights and SoundsThe character designs and settings are ok, I guess. Most of it is pretty generic and bland. Like I said, there is a lot of reused footage and still panning shots. I wouldn't be as annoyed as the panning shots as they're common in anime, but panning over a frozen image can only be excused if its an establishing shot, not an excuse for a fight scene. For some reason people defend the fight scenes saying that they're the best thing about this show, but if you watch them with out the spectacular soundtrack, they're pretty pathetic. I can't believe that such a talented composer is working on such trash. Or they might not be anymore, I don't know. The music is still good. The voice acting is not. I watched this with the English dub, which is terrible. I also watched some of the original Japanese dub, and it really isn't any better.",
        "The first two seasons of SOA are some of the most enjoyable action/adventure anime I've seen. Although harem-style, its not over-the-top, doesn't focus on sexuality, and although there is game violence it is somewhat limited and artificial enough to not be disturbing. The story line and characters are excellent, both in diversity and dimension. I could have easily given these seasons 7 or 8 stars.The last two seasons, \"Alicization\", turned much darker, far more twisted, more gratuitous in both nudity and blood/gore/violence/rape, and had a story far less developed and more \"when is this going to end?\" than the first two seasons.Not sure why. Perhaps they chose new writers / directors, but seasons 3 & 4 were just over-the-top awful. The stories remained interesting... but highly predictable and full of extremely nasty scenes. It's like they lost sight of what made the first two seasons of SOA enjoyable.My recommendation: stop watching after Season 2. Seasons 3 & 4 simply aren't worth your time. All but the most jaded viewers will be turned off by the extreme nature. The first two seasons could have been considered PG. The last two seasons were rated \"PG-14\" but really should have been rated TV-MA for their extreme, over-the top blood, gore and no-sensible-reason nudity (no details shown, but one of the characters spends the majority of a major \"boss fight\" completely nude... for no logical reason at all. The character had been dressed up to that point).Overall mixed feelings: The first two seasons are winners. The last two \"Alicization\" seasons absolute losers. Overall I give it 2 stars for dragging an interesting, fun series into the manure pile.",
        "Sword Art Online (SAO) was a pretty bad anime. I know loads of people loved this series, considering its popularity, but I have some complaints about the series nonetheless. The idea of being stuck in a virtual reality MMORPG really is a cool idea. It actually made me desperate for something like it, without the dying of course. However, the cool idea is the only place where this show scores points in my book, nor is it the first anime to use this idea.The first time watching this I loved it. The second time through I couldn't even make it past the second arc. Everything was so boring, and not just because I knew what was going to happen next. The characters are so unbelievably flat, and their conversations shedding little light on who they really are. All they ever talk about is \"Ever wonder if we'll get back to the real world?\" or \"Do you ever forget that we're in a game nowadays?\" They use variations of these questions in literally EVERY conversation. Why can't you just accept that your stuck, and move on with your life? Now you may argue \"Maybe they're just the kinds of people who don't let things go easily\". Maybe, but that doesn't stop the characters from being lame and uninspired. The creators ought to show some creativity with their characters, instead of rehashing the same character traits and changing their gender.That's not to say that I hated all the characters. Characters like Klein and Agil were my favorite characters. Why? Because they almost never brought up how much they missed the real world. All Kirito and Asuna do is whine about it. Sure, they have their distinct character traits that are shown through some dialogue and their actions, but the conversations they have together aren't ever about anything else. We know generally who they are, but never go fully into their character to see smaller, individual traits. It has to come up at least once every time they talk. The conversations they have with the secondary characters are more interesting because the others actually know how to move on. Some people have said that SAO has something for everyone, action for boys, romance for girls. You may disagree with this (many people seem to), but I found the action to be quite mediocre. The sequences of action were, although realistic for a video game, weren't fun to watch. In virtual reality you'd think that they'd add a bit more strategy to how they fight over just wailing on the enemy. When there was action though it was always interrupted by something less interesting, which really took away from it. The romance, on the other hand, is pretty poorly developed. It comes completely out of the blue, with Kirito and Asuna hating each other one episode, then completely in love the next. Where did this come from? The episode limitation. The creators had to rush everything because they had to cram two story arcs into 25 episodes (that's my theory anyway). I'm not saying that Kirito and Asuna weren't the best possible couple in this show, but it just happened randomly, with no explanation as to what their relationship was between the points of hatred and love, so their relationship really isn't all that developed. You may say \"Well the show is story-driven, not character driven\", well actually it isn't considering how little is actually put into the story, and how few episodes actually have to do with progressing it. Most episodes are spent 'developing' the characters. Even if it was completely story-driven, the characters are so flat that you wouldn't even care whether or not they achieved their goal.In terms of story arcs, the first one was much more enjoyable. Many people have said that the second was bad, but I thought it was alright. It wasn't as good as the first arc, but then again, the show isn't all that great either. I wish that they'd spent more time in the first arc, as Sword Art Online was way more interesting than Alfheim Online. VERDICT: Sword Art Online is a show that fails on many levels, with the exception of its not-so-original-but-still-cool idea. I feel like the reason why the show is so overrated was because everyone was so attractive. The bad guys were obviously bad because they were ugly, and the good guys were all good-looking. It felt like this show had more development of Asuna's rear end than her actual character did. Overall, Sword Art Online isn't worth watching. It was filled with lame main characters, poorly developed relationships, and an interesting but still linear story line.",
        "It's actually viewers of this drek who are trapped in a pretend world. In this world nothing much happens even though there's a constant hint of action just over the next scene.Lame characters, lame love story, lame villain with lame motives to do what he did.Thankfully, you don't have to clear the game or watch the whole episode to escape. You just have to stop watching this drek.",
        "Well I have to say, this has got to be the hardest anime to review and rate that I have come across so far. It is one hell of a mixture. But I did had a great time watching it, was very entertaining and that is what really matters. On the plus side, I loved the setting/premise, a world where virtual reality has been perfected and MMORPG's truly come to life. The RPG gamer in me was really happy while watching this anime. DAMN I wanted to be in SAO so bad. The animation was great, especially that of the action sequences. I loved em. Coupled with amazing soundtrack, they really became epic. Protagonist was very likable and cool. The heroin was hot. :pNow on the bad side, the anime felt really rushed in the beginning. It actually felt like I skipped an episode couple of times. Would have been better if they stretched out the first arc into 24 episodes or so, would have been much better. It got a little too much lovey dovey too later on, which was off putting. The side characters were good BUT they got very less screen time, way too less. It was like the anime forgot about them. And then there was the second arc. It didn't suck as bad as many said it would but still it was nowhere near as good as the first arc. IT just didn't had the same feeling as the first arc. The setting in it was cool, had a lot of Final fantasy vibe to it. But the love stuff was lame and pointless. As for the rating, well I would give it like: First arc (1-14 episodes) 8.8/10. Second arc 6.5/10. Overall, despite its flaws, I somehow still found it to be very enjoyable and was engaged in it a lot. 8.3/10.",
        "Maybe I'm a sap but I love this show. I loved it when I watched it ten years ago and I'm loving it again watching it with my daughter this year. It reminds me of all the good times that I had playing WoW and raiding with my guild. It's smart, funny, exciting, and thoughtful, as long as you ignore the weird cousin-love thing that crops up for a few episodes(Note that I've only watched the first two seasons...)",
        "Review for Season One\nI don't understand what the hype was about, it was very so-so, nothing much to write home about. It did have a few good episodes but many more dull ones were there too.",
        "Somehow Sword Art Online manages to get me hooked every time a new season comes out with an interesting premise. And then it manages to throw out most of the rules it establishes early on in favor of action and drama. In the process it always messes up the characters and story to the point at which you just want to turn off.Season 1 one starts with the idea of locking people into an online game while focusing on the mental stress that puts on the players because when you die in the game the VR device fries your brain effectively killing you outside. After a short while it basically just abandons that concept of the stress and just goes for Kirito (the MC) being overpowered while building a harem and basically beating the creator at his own game freeing everyone. Kirito is basically cheating.Season 2 start with a new game world with Asuna from season one still being imprisoned and no one knows exactly how. Kirito starts in a new world with different skill sets but is still overpowered. He fights his way through the world somehow uniting the players behind him to beat an unwinnable fight rescuing his sweet heart Asuna. Again Kirito is basically cheating.Season 3 we go into a completely different game scenario with guns. It looks interesting at first, but gets boring really fast because the characters are boring and Kirito again is overpowered even though he basically fights with a sword in a game centered around guns. So yeah it's again cheating...Season 4 is the longest one and net yet completely done (about 4-5 episodes still missing). Still with 44 episodes done I can say that the first half is pretty good, with cool characters and a bromance instead of to much focus on a harem. Kirito is not as overpowered anymore the concepts and story are actually really entertaining. To bad that once again they throw out concepts that are established early on in favor of DRAMA! Oh and the main antagonist of the second half is just terrible in terms of concept, design and powers. Imagine jumping into a game for the first time and getting the most powerful character of the evil faction. Then pretty quickly losing that character to one of the secondary good guys. Afterwards he imports his main character from a different game and becomes way more powerful than before with stuff we haven't seen before in this world ans there is absolutely no explanation on where is powers are coming from.Also we have a secondary antagonist who comes back from season 1 and who for whatever reason has the power to influence other players that logged in from all over the world (how exactly that worked is also highly questionable). He is able to affect these people on a mental level to do what he wants because apparently he just has the power to do so. If VR devices had the power to do what has been shown in this show they would be banned so quickly for the general public because it would just be way to dangerous.Oh and btw. the writer of SOA apparently \"likes\" to use \"struggle snuggle\" scenarios. They appear a few times throughout the show but always stop before it gets to the actual \"action\" part. Even with that said - if you don't like that, then you may want to avoid SOA.",
        "I have mixed feelings about this show. It has many good things, but it also has its fair share of bad things. The first half of the show, I like. It's just pure entertainment, with absolutely nothing else, but it's watchable and addictive. The animation is great, I love seeing the world of Sword Art Online, the threat of death creates a little tension, and watching our two main characters Kirito and Asuna fall in love is sweet and charming. The second half I hate. I don't like the new world Alfheim Online. It never captured my interest the way Sword Art Online did and the threat of death is gone. The whole arc with Kiritos' sister is unbearably annoying and I really wish they had just cut that out. Lastly, Asuna, the all powerful Asuna, is reduced to the clich\u00e9d damsel in distress, which is stupid, dumb, and makes no sense. All that being said, I still enjoy the show and recommend you watch it. There are stupid things and it may not require much brain power, but you can have fun with it.",
        "I finally watched SAO after delaying it... and well shouldn't have wasted my time.I'm giving this a 3 just because of the beautiful art and the one episode where a group he was with got killed because of him (I felt for him then) but besides that I'm never going to get the hype for this.I don't mind the clich\u00e9 plot since I've watched plenty clich\u00e9 anime that I still love. Don't believe people who rave that SAO has unique plot that's like saying Disney's Frozen was the first movie to present strong independent women (*cough* Brave *cough* Mulan *cough* Pocahontas). What was dreadful about this was how it was presented. You start off strong getting the feeling like it's going to be a good action anime with the loner MC but nooooo it's actually secretly just a harem anime...if I wanted that I'll watch harem anime.You never see MC training or struggling... he's just -boom- OP. The anime's main plot is \"getting out of the game\" so you'd thought you'd see the people there actually try hard to beat the game (haha). I mean yeah sure plot armor happens (ie Naruto, One Piece, etc where MC never really dies) but at least you can see them struggle and you can feel for them and root for them. Nope, not in SAO. MC's just OP at the beginning and until the end. By the time I got into the final boss fight I was desensitized by his overpoweredness that at his supposed death (since you know getting stabbed with little to no life should've killed him but it takes minutes before he actually disappears so he can deliver a final blow to kill the boss) I felt nothing. No tension. Nothing. Not even happy for him that it's the end.Another is where everything jumps. In Episode A you're in level 50 and then for Episode B you're in another setting...Episode C you're back to the start... huh. I got so confused I had to check the wiki episode descriptions just to check if I was still on the right track or was simply watching the wrong episode.The most waste was the FMC. She was presented early on as this strong mysterious loner type but then after some episode jumps she just becomes this useless harem girl *sigh* (they even got married in- game. LOL). It's kinda laughable how some of the episodes we're shown one girl get rescued by MC and they immediately fall in love with MC..at least give us something more to root for.Probably going to get hate for this since plenty love it but I just don't get it. I tried reading positive reviews but most just say \"It's the best anime\" \"Sword Art Online is ridiculously well made with great character development\" \"Deep and moving story\" ...none of which I saw so I'm questioning if we watched the same series.",
        "The first two episodes are the best, after that, the show devolves into a FanFiction for your eyes. The protagonist is the textbook example of wish fulfillment. This guy can defeat anything, anyone and get anything from anyone no matter what. He's way too powerful for the story to actually mean anything.SOA has an interesting premise where 10,000 players are trapped in a VRMMO where death in the game means death in real life. The show does try to tackle the mental toll of what it'll be like where your life literally can end at any moment in the game, but where it drops the ball in showcasing this premise is in its protagonist.You have little reason to worry for Kirito, since you already know he's going to end up out of whatever situation he finds himself in. The game mechanics are barely there at all and the random time jumps from days to months breaks up the pace greatly.Hype is good, but that doesn't mean the story will be any good.",
        "Sword Art Online is fine show and I can say has a lot of tone problems, .The first half of the show is fun people commit suicide people kill their wife There's a fishing episode. It's just fun but this chaotic and a tone is all over the placeI must say it's hard to take suicide serious when it happens so lightly in the show.And the darker parts of the show fall on flat for me, but the Love Story I like and it was nice seeing it and the later half of the show was you know a bit more boring but more consistent, but it was more boring so it doesn't really go up at least in the last episode. They take it on to 11 by making the villain a truly creepy person.But the production was good the music animation. It was just on the technical level really good put together.As Older person, I'm not really impressed by the show but if I were younger. I would have really loved it all the tonal shift all the dark moments, i thought it was the most adult show in the world, but now I just laugh at it, but yeah, it is ok.",
        "If you want to do yourself a favor, watch just the first season. The rest are so bad, I needed to fast forward.",
        "This anime is very good, the story and fight scene is awesome. All the arc is perfect especially Alicization arc. You must watch this anime once in a life",
        "Finished season 1 of Alicization. This is still an awesome series. I can't wait to see how the next season unravels. I feel like Kirito and Asuna never catch a break. Because of SOA they are forever tortured by people trying to replicate and advance the original technology and Kirito seems to always be the ultimate test for these systems. Still Awesome!",
        "Yeah, they just keep doing it! They figure out a new plot that is just as good or better than the original. This one has been awesome all the way through. The only thing I can knock them on is they have dragged out the \"Catatonic Kirito\" thing too long. He just woke up and it took forever, but once he did it's like all was right with the world! Which led me to this thought.....I have watched so many Anime's. There are several that I tend to watch over and over. \"The Irregular at Magic High School\", \"Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\", any of the \"Fate/\" series, \"Wiseman's Grandchild\", \"Arifureta\", \"Chivalry of a Failed Knight\" and so on and so on......But let me ask you this, when you think of all the things Kirito has down and who he is as a character and all he has survived.......Has there ever been a better Hero character? Think about it. Food for thought.",
        "Sword Art Online runs under the premise almost out of a Saw film: A master programmer of an MMORPG has entrapped everyone in the game and the only way to escape is to fight your way through a series of dungeons in order to fight the final boss. Players in the real world lay in a vegetative state and will be killed instantly should anyone try to remove the virtual reality unit they are tied too. And somehow an incredible amount of time passes and no one has been able to figure out a solution to this. Sword Art Online seems to have all the elements of a potential heart racing thriller but doesn't seem to care about that.The writing is really mismatched on this series that it almost feels like there's two camps of writers on this, one team that seems more interested in making a series about a regular MMO and regular people that play them and a another camp that wants to make a regular fantasy series with a mix of science-fiction elements. Either one of these would be fine for a show, where it not for the fact that the series had set it self up to be an action thriller with people's lives hanging in the balance. It gets to the point it seems like the staff wants to be doing one of these shows but got stuck doing an adaptation of existing material by the studio.Each episode feels as disconnected as the next with little overarching connection to it. What manages to save it from really feeling like there are really two different teams of writers trying to make the show something completely different, is the cast of uninteresting characters. For being in such a stressful and dangerous situations the characters all seem strangely calm about this. There doesn't seem to be anxiety, a desire to race to the finish and get back to reality sooner or even survive. Everyone seems to carry on as normal when you expect mass races to the finish, team ups or anything more sensible. Even the main character seems to not give any kind of care about this. Seeing a bunch of character behave like everything is normal with not even the slightest inclination that all is not well just robs this series of any peril. And and there's no indication that these are troubled people who'd rather live out their world in virtual reality, so there's no justification of the strange amount of calm. It's the same kind of problem I had with Toyko Magnitude 8.0 which also found a group of characters in a very stressful and life threatening situation but didn't show any signs of it. The series really relies on you suspending your disbelief.The animation quality is pretty good it's pretty standard animation fare but I hardly think it's as quality as many say it is but it's certainly not bad either.I never thought I'd see the day when I actually found a musical score by Yuki Kajiura so boring that I have zero interest in even sampling the soundtrack down the road. This has to be one of Kajiura's least interesting scores since The Garden of Sinners film series but even those had some strong theme songs behind them, this has nothing! For being a more symphonic score outside of Kajiura's usual small musician ensemble she fails so terribly at catching any of her stylistic charm seen with past scores nor any sense of flair nor adventure that comes with a different direction. It's an even less interesting rendition version of Fate/Zero and not a single solitary piece stands out to make it worth mentioning. I've been a fan of Kajiura for many years and I've never been let down so hard before.This series is one of these most overrated series of the past year with very little that makes it worth a good watch. The series has a lot of action but very little substance to back it up and even the action isn't that fun because there's no thrill or danger to it.If you want a series that better explores the depths of MMORPG and has a better grip on what kind of a story it wants, I would actually recommend the .hack series, which does share it's similarities to Sword Art Online, such as both featuring characters trapped within virtual worlds.",
        "I finished the first two seasons now and I'm actually wondering how this show got its good reputation in the anime scene. I mean the first 6 or so episodes were entertaining and I was curious how it all plays out but as soon as they leave the soa game the show just got stuck into a boring love story and doesn't really seem to get out of it at all. The fights are mediocre and the characters are very linear and flat written. The world building doesn't really exist after the first few episodes and the story overall just isn't really exciting I feel like. I probably won't watch the next seasons since my expectations aren't really that high.",
        "This is an okay anime series. Why do people hate it so much?It is because of the supposed \"sexism\"? (Lol, as if the otaku crowd has ever cared that much about sexism) or because the main character supposedly is a \"Mary Sue/Gary Stu/Marty Stu/Whatever\"? A lot of protagonists in shonen anime are bigger Mary Sues yet people love them. Just ask Akira Toriyama."

    "Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic": [
        "Overall, this show is pretty good in terms of writing, animation, art, and literally every other aspect. I really enjoy watching it, but for some reason I get bored watching it so I'm just going to stop. Might come back to watch it eventually though. If I do. Then I guess I'll watch the second season. I would recommend watching this show, but I don't have much to say about it.",
        "This is an fantastic series to watch, where the famed Aladdin is teamed up with Ali-Baba to wander the desert and have just plain old fun. But as with all things good, it has to come to an end in a most maniacal way. By happenstance, Ali-Baba told his Mage friend that he would conquer the present dungeon in order to stop slavery in his small home town. With the help of Aladdin, they breached the gates and stopped the interiors monsters within to win. But as soon as that happened, a mysterious Djinn appeared and whisked him along with Aladdin plus an ex slave girl away to far off distant lands in order to find each other again. So as Aladdin went on his adventures he finally came across Ali-Baba once more only to find out he was head of a gang of forty thieves to stop a local king and his tyranny. However, in the background lies an old sect known as the Kou Empire, headed by a princess that has a secret love for Sinbad who is also helping to stop the tyrannical young king. With her help, or somehow begging for it some time in the future, the rebels along with Sinbad and the forty thieves must stop the king from selling his own people as slaves to quell their debt from the empire. But in the darkest shadows, Aladdin's own Djinn named Ugo had lost his eight pointed star on his flute, without it, the Djinn can use his awesome powers against anyone as he sees fit without Aladdin's consent. Now with the war looming and new adversaries in front, Ali-Baba and his crew must face horrible facts about the use of magic. And why it is so important that doing things without the help of Magi will cause them all to know victory, although the bitter taste of defeat now and again will put a strain on all of them. I thoroughly love this series, with the great action scenes, and music that fits so well. The story is top notch with new twists and turns to give the characters new ways to overcoming their fears and sadness in the face of tyranny. It's not often to see a show like this, with the old ancient cities of Balbadd and ports for which Sinbad is so well known for. It seems his role as a king is well known to all in the ports as well as the interiors of the provinces. His weight can help, and to see him stop the mysterious princess in her tracks says to me he is more than just a sailor and captain of the seas. His presence alone could win the war, and stop the king, yet it seems he is just observing the rebels at a distance, helping in small ways. Again, a great series, a must see for all ages who love magic, action, music and a really good tale to dream about while sleeping. Recommended to all ages, fantastic.",
        "I got to the 11th episode before I realized that it I stopped right then and there, I would just completely forget about this show and not care at all to finish it. I never looked forward to the next episode and I never found it that interesting. It's just extremely unmemorable. It has the vibe of a comedy isekai but it takes itself too seriously for its own good, and the action isn't that great either. It's ok at everything it does, but it's not particularly great at anything. The only character that I liked at all really was Morgiana. I would not recommend this unless you are just looking for a way to kill time.",
        "Pros:\nNice animation\nComplex storyline\nOutcomes are not obvious\nA lot of different players used well\nDecent character backgroundsMeh:\nMany fights are won because of the script instead of skill.\nUsage of Arabian Night story names can be confusing at first.Cons:\nThings are hard only the first time, then it's easy for everyone\nSome histories make no sense\nInnuendo thrown in for jokes, for the most part, detract from the story.There are three seasons and each season has its own name. Season 1 is Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, Season 2 continues the story as Magi: The Kingdom of Magic, Season 3 is a prequel about Sinbad, telling the first half of his story. Personally, i rate the first season as 8/10, the second season as 9/10, and the third as 7/10. The first season tells a decent story of its own and then sets up for Season 2, so overall, 9/10.The animation in the show is pretty standard, it's the story that makes it decent, and the intrigue and philosophical issues that make it shine. It's not deeply philosophical or anything like that, but in the course of the story it touches upon slavery, revenge, classed societies, blind allegiance, and redemption, and many other topics. Most of these are shown in histories and given as reasons for acting this way or that, and in most cases, they spend at least a moment showing both sides of the argument and how people react to them. I don't know if this was all intended to be looked at that way, though it is an impressive amount of ideas that i only noticed in retrospect.The story itself incorporates a lot of ideas. Arabian Nights plays a role in the names and a little of the background, with Aladdin and Sinbad prominently mentioned. There's the magi who guide and choose kings with hints of the New Testament and the wizards from Lord of the Rings, and of course King Solomon and his wisdom from the Old Testament. In all these cases the names and perhaps one or two of the famous attributes are used in the story, but after that, nothing is really the same. The use of the good and bad parts of magic, and even how magic has affinities is similar to the Force in Start Wars.After the background is set, a lot of the story revolves around the politics of various kingdoms, their ideologies, and how they do business. It can get hard to follow if you have a hard remembering too many things at once, but it's worth it when everything and everyone comes together. War is a fact of life in this anime, and cunning decisions are made quite well.The background stories are given as required, and part of the story is discovery. The discoveries are given at the right time, so it's not like you wonder when will they tell us this already. It's done well.There are a few points that are stupid though. Fights are won because the script says they are, and they just aren't interesting outside the graphics for the spells. There are bad guys that take forever to kill at first and after that someone can kill tens of them in one shot. It can get crazy at times as the story progresses, and you just have to accept it even though it makes no sense.Another good part of the story is who the hero is. Since you follow one person, you root for him, but there are others with good or noble causes either at first or as the story progresses. That you do not know who is \"good\" and who is \"evil\" adds a nice complexity, and it is done quite well. It isn't like the \"complicated\" backgrounds used elsewhere as a cheap imitation of depth.I don't think this series deserves 10/10 but it certainly has potential. The complexity and philosophical aspects that you come across in the story make it a good watch, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.",
        "This is such a great show! I will say that I am not finished with the series, but honestly, this show is so good; I only wish there were more episodes!",
        "Before I get into this, keep in mind that this is a review for all of Magi up to this point, not just season 2.When I was first introduced to Magi, I could only think, \"great, an anime ripoff of Disney's Aladdin.\" Like come on. It's in an Arabian desert setting, it has magical blue wish-granting genies, and to top it off, one of the main characters is even named Aladdin. How they didn't run into copyright issues for this I will never know. But the more I watched Magi, the more I saw it grow into its own. I watched it meet, and often exceed, all of my expectations of what constitutes a good piece of entertainment. But looking back, I can't say I can pinpoint any aspect of the show that truly wowed me.STORY - 7.7/10\nThere's no doubt that Magi has a very good storyline. It follows a journey through a surprisingly well fleshed out world filled with both dream-like fantasy and well-defined realism. Through this world, some genuinely interesting ideas about fate, class, and friendship are explored, and it's not afraid to get into the darker side of things. One of its most impressive features is its vast number of kingdoms, each with fully functioning governments and economies that really help showcase all the major themes of the show. But in general, the storyline seems to just wander around its world without any major focus or backbone, and it's often hard to see what it's really trying to accomplish. This also lets it drag at times, like in the middle of season 1 and and the beginning of season 2, where the pacing takes a hit. But overall, Magi tells a very impressive story, especially in the second half of season 2 where all its strengths culminate.CHARACTERS - 7.3/10\nCharacters are a bit of a mixed bag for the show. On one hand you have characters like Titus, Hakuryuu, Morgiana, and Matal, who all have very engaging arcs and motives over the course of Magi. But on the other, main characters like Alibaba and Aladdin seem to pale in comparison. Alibaba's not too bad, but his characterization's pretty stale and it never really feels like he changes much throughout the story. And Aladdin, while fun for a lot of comic relief, doesn't really have much depth to his character at all. Side characters are similarly mixed, with some being really interesting, like Gyokuen, and others being comically bad, like Abhmad. All in all though, there's definitely more good than bad going on in the character department.ART - 6.4/10\nAs far as the art goes, it's pretty good. Like I said earlier, the world has some interesting settings which look nice and colorful. There's nothing mind-blowing going on here though. The fights generally look pretty average, with some being better and some being worse. It does the job and it's more than good enough.SOUNTRACK - 5.3/10\nThe soundtrack also does the trick, but it definitely leans towards a more average quality. It isn't very memorable at all and listening to it alone doesn't do much for me. I'll give it some points for matching the Arabian aesthetic and for combining a lot of different instruments and voices. The voice acting is also sufficient, but nothing really stood out there either. Same for its openings and endings.OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 7.4/10\nSo in the end, did Magi end up being a diamond in the rough? (Heh, see what I did there Aladdin fans?). I'd certainly say so. It's really got no bad aspects, and for what little it may lack in art and sound, it more than makes up for with its gripping storyline and broad range of well developed characters. While I can't say that its ideas changed my life or that its moments moved me to tears, I'm confident that it'll satisfy anyone who's looking for some high quality entertainment.",
        "Very few people knows about magi series it is underrated that we all know but if you watch it you will not find why it is underrated storyline 10/10 character development 9/10 fights 9.5/10 and it's ost are superb 10/10 you can compare it's ost with top 5 animes also it so badass. And you will love the Djinn Equip form of everyone if anyone is a fan of black clover then you will loved this for sure watch it for weebs shake",
        "It has a deep social problems approachWorth watching.Shows us the kind of things real history books try to hide from us so that corrupt real life governants, mainly in poor countries, can continue their abusive oppression and exploiting on the common ppl w/o being questioned.The above mentioned isnt a spoiler, but a reason to continue watching it in case u think it is too kidish on the initial episodes.",
        "If you're a fan of adventure, action, and fantasy, this is the perfect anime for you! Magi starts off with a clever premise, it takes parts from some of the characters in the famous \"1001 Nights\" tales and mixes them together in an original, exciting story that will keep you always wanting to watch the next episode to see what happens. The animation is very good, and the dubbed voice acting is solid. If you're familiar with dubbed Anime, you'll recognize a bunch of the voice actors. Magi even has some good messages about friendship and choosing not to hate those who have hurt you.Overall I would recommend Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic to any Shonen style Anime fans, Anime fans in general, and to anyone who just enjoys a fun, adventurous tale of fantasy and friendship.",
        "I love anime and manga. This anime was recommended to me, I first watched the prequel, Adventures of Sinbad and I fell in love with those characters. Then I started Magi. The main characters were different from AoS but I also loved them. I love the Arabic theme and how it actually ties into some ancient history. It's so interesting and unique. Then once I finished the anime I read the manga and OH. MY. GOD. I could NOT stop reading it. I read about 132 chapters in a week. Every free moment I got I was reading. This story is SO good and it gets even better in the manga. I really hope this gets another season because it will be even better!",

        "I liked it from the start but after 10 episodes everything started to seem a little dull. Eventually I was irritated by Alibaba as a character. He is strong but weep for everything. Every episode he says he's useless.He does everything except to try to become strong. As a whole i think the emotion in the character was overdone and unnecessary. Though I like all the other characters. But the story was fantastic.",
        "first i want to start off with all the not so good things about they did with the series. first there were a few points were i felt like the arcs and overall story were rushed. secondly some of the good characters we did not get to see them as much as i wanted to.what really makes this series deserve the rating of 8.8 is that the story was well planned out and at no point so far (episode 24) i haven't seen any fillers. the soundtracks and opening also add to this effect. most of all it is the characters and the overall goal that both became properly established in the second season than the first season. the new abilities and ideals in the second season the characters get in there world makes this series that much more enjoyable.there are so many more reasons why i would give this series and 8.8 but i don't want to spoil the plot for you.",
        "This show/manga is amazing. Easily one of my favourite shows of all time. I absolutely love and adore the characters, storyline/plot, ART, and sound track of this series. The creators are incredibly talented. This story couldn't have came to me at a better time in my life and I absolutely cannot express how grateful I am for this masterpiece. I will recommend this to all my friends and continue to show my love and support in any way shape or form. If I could have one wish, it would literally be to see a final season for Magi: the Labyrinth of magic. Either way, Thank you for this <3."

    "Samurai Champloo": [
        "Fuu is a humble waitress when she finds herself in the middle of a battle between two samurai, who are battling a shared foe when they meet one another for the first time and start their battle of skills. Mugen is a wild warrior of little discipline but plenty of skill to match his arrogance; Jin is a disciplined samurai whose self-control only compliments his prowess with a sword. Sadly for them, their desire to fight to prove their superiority sees them captured by their foes and sentenced to death. Fuu rescues them but asks the condition that they put their fight to one side for a while and help her to find a samurai who smelt of sunflowers. They agree and set out on the road to their goal, with a dangerous journey ahead of them.I love the style of anime but I am not a massive fan of the genre and don't watch a great deal of it. The Samurai Champloo DVD's came into my mailbox with little in the way of fanfare, mainly because I know nothing more of Cowboy Beebop than the name, and so had no specific ideas about this series. The opening hip-hop grabbed my attention but I was also aware that this is all part of the style and packaging that the genre now has, so I didn't assume that cool credits would equal a cool series. The opening episode is a little jarring in the early stages as it cuts back on itself, makes \"errors\" in rewinding and other little gimmicks that distracted me, however these do not dominate any episode \u0096 they just stuck in my mind as they were part of my first impression and didn't totally work straight away. From here we join the quest, which is not really spoken of that much, allowing the series to be more episodic and about the adventures of the wandering warriors and Fuu.As a narrative this is perhaps not the most flowing way to go but one could say the same about the A-Team, Littlest Hobo or any series where a journey produces a different story each week within the same framework and approach. Some of the episodes are not that great but mostly they are enjoyable. The main reason for this is the characters, who are cool, funny and stylish in the way that all animated samurai are. The dynamics of the three characters work well and I found myself interested in them as much as any specific tale. The big draw though is of course the style of the series and in this regard it delivers. While it may be very much genre stuff, it is still very well done. The hip-hop music is not just plastered on but is mostly sparingly used while the visuals are impressive \u0096 and never moreso than in the fight scenes that are slick and exciting. As with many anime, it would be possible to freeze frame a lot of this stuff and hang it on your wall as a picture.As with any genre product, Samurai Champloo will perhaps not be \"good\" enough to appeal to a mass audience and it certainly will not win over those who simply dislike anime. However it is a fine example of the genre with an episodic narrative producing mostly good episodes, engaging characters and cool style for miles. Not perfect but enjoyable and cool throughout.",
        "This anime series follows Mugan and Jin; two very different samurai, who join Fuu; a young woman on a quest to find the 'samurai who spells of sunflowers. Mugan is a somewhat wild character with a brilliant but unconventional fighting style while Jin is the epitome of what a reserved samurai should be; these two unlikely travelling companions are travelling with Fuu because she saves them from execution in episode one. Their quest takes them through Edo era Japan and on their way they come across many interesting characters and various dangerous situations. It may come as a surprise but most of these encounters are also very funny.Coming from the creator of 'Cowboy Bebop' I should have expected something special but I was a little unsure if hip-hop in the time of the samurai would be anything other than silly\u0085 as it turns out there isn't too much of that and what there is is frequently hilarious! The three protagonists are each great and distinctive characters. There is a fair amount of action; some of it fairly bloody and as the series approaches its conclusion there is an increased sense that the characters are in real danger. There are plenty of laughs to be had; usually due to amusing situations rather than gags and one-liners you might expect in a sitcom. There is a small amount of swearing, some of it in English, but not enough to spoil the series for older viewers\u0085 the bloodshed already means the series isn't really suitable for youngsters to watch! The animation looks great with good character designs and backgrounds that seem to capture the feeling of the era. Overall I think this is a great series and heartily recommend it to anybody who enjoys anime; in fact I suspect even people who aren't usually anime fans may enjoy this.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "Samurai Champloo (whatever a Champloo is I can't say) is one of those truly nifty late-night anime shows that pop up every now and again on Cartoon Network. It took a DVD viewing though, with four episodes back to back, to get a real taste of the storytelling panache that goes with the rugged saga of bad-ass samurai. The two main characters, one who is a little more scrawny but with enough power to kick a few heads in at once, and another who is more conventionally well-built but with a pair of glasses to assist in his travels, go through a series of events while on the search- by pay/bailing out/demand of a feisty girl- for the \"Sunflower Samurai\". While the revamp for American audiences includes a slightly annoying theme song (is it hardcore samurai anime or a basketball commercial?), there's always good voice-work going on, and an adherence to certain traditions that are a main-stay in samurai storytelling (the old samurai who feels his time is done and does seppuku after a card game; the ideal not to kill someone if there's no pay involved; grudges that come from the hot-headed never leading well; the feisty and strong-willed young girl meant to but doesn't quite match the guys). It's also a lot of fun; plenty of humor rests on moments that seem like they're meant in poor taste for laughs, like when the girl gets sacked- literally- by some guys who put her up to work as a slave/dancer in a bar. Or just in the attitudes of the main two samurai, who are ready at a moment's notice to fight one another, and begrudgingly stop because of hesitation or, of course, they get caught by some p-o'd warlord. It's a cool series overall, one of the best that's playing still from time to time on TV, and should be essential viewing for those that eat up action-filled anime like cotton candy at a good amusement park.",
        "I was really into it at first, but then it seemed to go into filler more with unrelated stories. some were good but most i didn't care for. and i like the style and the cool things they do with altered history, but it got tired after a while. (1 viewing, 2/13/2020)",
        "First some disclaimers. I came to anime late in life, not completely understanding the power of this art form in the right hands. I have since compensated for this untoward behaviour by watching about 50 of the genre, both full length and series, sequentially, in a very short period of time. Like, days. I am currently not sure what year it is, or what country I am living in, but I know for a fact that anime is no less an art form than the stuff you stand in line for at the museums. Second disclaimer, after watching this series, I made a beeline for Cowboy Beebop -- oops sorry for the pun -- but could not get past the first in the series. (This may or may not lend credibility to the other IMDb reviewers who maintain the two series are as different as they are similar?) Disclaimers aside, this is a wonderful treat, fun, action-packed, great music, fascinating themes, and a lot hidden irony (and other treats) buried deep in the dialog for those with very sharp ears. The characters, who form a brilliant ensemble cast, are as good anything in mainstream media. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE English AUDIO. The hip-hop sub-theme is fun, never too distracting. Highly recommended. FOOTNOTES: After watching a highly concentrated mix of Japanese and American anime, my conclusion is that the Japanese product is better crafted to an entirely higher order of magnitude. My favorite so far is APPLESEED, which, no coincidence, had, I believe, the strongest story line and script to support the wonderful animation. My criticism of Japanese anime generally is that the stories tend to be considerably weaker than the animation, leaving the viewer with an \"A/V high\" that last for a few hours, and then you forget why you liked the product in the first place. (oops) American product is better written, period. I consider the LAST AIRBENDER series, and the feature OVER THE HEDGE, to be two of the best productions ever done in America, regardless of genre.",
        "I have to say, I quite enjoyed the anime. It was really hilarious in a scene from episode 9 where the character Mugen was always bumping into the jogger (voiced by the great Vast the Stompade from Trigun,Johnny Yong Bosch) and my god that jogger made ya laugh xDLoved the action with the incredible fighting scenes, the characters and the gorgeous animation! I give this 8/10!",
        "What really made me love \"Cowboy Bebop\" was how it was able to mix genre, culture, style, and music that seemed almost like an unlikely mix but turned out to hit the right notes. It's done the second time around but directed this time toward the samurai genre and hip hop music, which on a side note I'm not a fan of either one but this show is one of the exceptions I make. And this is also another of my personal favorite anime TV shows.Unlike \"Cowboy Bebop\" this show actually does have a plot but isn't entirely concerned about it since it's really more of a motivation device. This is a show where style over tops substance.It's just great seeing an alternate version on ancient Japan which is a blend of both old and current customs making it all the more interesting and humorous. The hip hop soundtrack is awesome it really blends in well with the action and what currently happens as the show progresses. But of course as usual it's the characters and what they do that really drive it, their colorful and three dimensional enough for us to actually care about them.Mugen whom looks like he could be an ancestor of Spike Spegel is basically reckless, irresponsible, arrogant, tough, rough, not altogether bright, a rebel without a cause and has a bit of an inflated ego complex where he at times he brags he's killed lots of people though I highly doubt it is really everything he builds it up to be. Deep down though his heart is in the right place, he is capable of doing what is right whether he wants to or not. He sort of represents a more modern western school of action since his style of fighting is sort of your conventional swordplay mixed with break dancing.Jin who looks like actor Christian Bale is sort of the passive aggressive type. A man of very few words, he really doesn't say much in the show sometimes and when he does talk it's a very soft even voice. He's a silent rebel, doesn't bend to anyone and does the right thing when needed. He's represents the old school type of action since his style is based on the martial art Bushido, his moves are more precise but always quick as lighting.Fuu is naive in a good or bad way, worst of all seems to be a magnet for trouble even though she's not looking for it. She of course is sort of the mediator for the two, but whenever she turns her back both of them tend to duke it out. She's very sweet, feminine, smart'clever making her at times one step ahead as well as helpful or unhelpful for the two.The dynamic between all of them is sort of like any buddy buddy/buddy cop film, a road trip movie, or heck even a noir film since all three of them have hidden motives that we see as the show progresses. It's just fun and funny seeing the interplay between them all, despite their disagreements and grief they give one another subconsciously they are all close friends. Indeed it does show since despite the time both Jim and Mugen fight they never land one blow on one another as well as get untimely interrupted (may'be that's fate's way of telling them something). Both always work together to rescue Fuu whenever she's in trouble even though they didn't have to. All three of them seem to hold more conversations then the other people they talk to, but most of all they can trust one another the most. These characters really don't have anyone else in their lives which is why they mix; most of the people in their past or even present either have used them or betrayed them in some way.Dance to this Samurai Beat.Rating: 4 stars",
        "Fuu, a waitress who works in a teahouse, rescues two master swordsmen, Mugen and Jin, from their execution to help her find the \"samurai who smells of sunflowers.\"This anime is an excellent example of a master piece from start to finish with characters that you would remember forever each with unique personalities.The music was entertaining and it fitted the setting very well. The animation and art style was excellent. The dub was fantastic Steve Blum, Kari Wahlgren and Kirk Thornton were excellent as the three leads. The story was also well written without getting boring or uninteresting.If you are into animes with raps and action you might enjoy this.",
        "Can pointlessness ruin a story? And must a television show have an ultimate goal to be compelling? It's hard to answer these questions, especially in an age where the popularity of episodic sitcoms is on the rise and the formerly dominant serials and dramas are struggling to stay afloat. In the past decade, anime has experienced the same upheaval, and many of the most popular anime series of late have been so-called \"slice of life\" shows with virtually no unifying plot and, in some cases, no commitment to continuity. One might ask whether the tendency to literally \"lose the point\" is bad, but whatever the case, I've seen plenty of good sitcom-style series, and I have to admit that it's sometimes quite refreshing to see anime stop taking itself seriously. We get a crisis, however, when a show does present us with a central story and then spends almost no time developing it, leaving us with a half-formed idea entirely smothered by diversions and distractions. This turned out to be the problem at the core of Samurai Champloo, an entertaining but flawed pastiche of Edo-era Japan that is brought down by over-the-top antics and commitments that the series unfortunately never quite fulfills.Samurai Champloo comes to us courtesy of Shinichiro Watanabe, a director famous for his close joining of setting to a given era's musical culture, and in this case he presents us with an anachronistic fusion of 20th century hip-hop music, a quintessential anti-establishment genre, and 18th century Japan, where the once-unshakable structures of the samurai and the shogunate were just beginning to totter. But while Watanabe may have advertised the show as a seamless fusion, the touches are in fact few and far between, which is a pity considering that the ones he does include hit the mark quite well. For example, we get a hilarious episode depicting \"tagger\" culture as an offshoot of a dojo, and in the first episode a record \"scratches\" through time, stopping briefly in the 20th century for comic effect. Aside from the sometimes-seen presence of boom-boxes and shorts, however, (along with some \"colorful\" language that is quite entertaining at times), there really isn't much else. I was disappointed by how little the show seemed to try, and even when the pastiches worked perfectly I only came away wishing that the show had given me more of them.What frustrated me most about Samurai Champloo, however, was that it spent almost no time on its purported \"story\", for aside from the occasional flashback or secondary account, we learn very little about this \"Sunflower Samurai\" for a very, very long time. In what is the show's most damaging mistake, the action never brings us any closer to him, nor, for that matter, does it give us much indication of who he is until the last quarter of the show. After a while, as the show seems to lose sight of its purpose, it begins to feel like an excuse to have sword fights, and indeed, if the show gives us nothing else, it gives us lots and lots of bloody, bloody, bloody combat. I'm not squeamish, but I have to admit that I found the amount of violence in this show to be a bit gratuitous, for while we at least never see organs flying or bones being pulled out, we do get a virtually endless river of blood. While I originally enjoyed Mugen and Jin's fighting, finding their charismatic style to be quite impressive, after a point, when the two had slaughtered an army and come away unharmed for the umpteenth time, I became somewhat disturbed. I will also say that I was bothered whenever the show ended an episode with a violent death and then began the next episode with the trio traveling on their merry way, and while, on a cultural level, it may make sense for a samurai to be detached from his kill, I personally found this detachment to be a bit too nihilistic for my taste.The show is, frankly, also way too ridiculous for its own good, and while it makes the smart move of performing an onscreen disavowal of any claim to accuracy, this move does make it puzzling as to why it insists on tackling historical subjects with the degree of seriousness it attempts. Samurai Champloo is too sedate to be a parody but too devoid of substance to be an analytical examination, and when the show half-jokingly examines subjects such as the persecution of Christians and Japan's economic isolation, it becomes a boring and confusing mess. The results are utterly embarrassing at times, particularly during a \"baseball\" episode that is so filled with cheese, bad-execution, morbid but unfunny jokes, and stereotypes that it made me want to abandon this series (and the fact that this followed an abysmal episode involving zombies ... yes, I am serious, zombies ... did not help in the slightest). And as if the show doesn't already feel off-kilter, Samurai Champloo makes the mistake of giving us a smattering of weak two and three-part arcs in the midst of its episodic plots. These arcs typically give us a new character, knead a reasonable (if none-too remarkable) story around them, and then expect us to care about the events that play out, which usually involve some half-baked tragic elements and plenty of violence from our Samurai friends. While I may have faulted the show for being too episodic, it was, ironically, these multi-episode stories that really grated on me the most. They move too fast and have too little subtlety for me to take them seriously, and they unfortunately feel like poor apologies for the people originally drawn in by the promise of a solid plot. While I found one of them, a story about warring clans, to be quite entertaining, the others proved to be irritating, and my enjoyment was generally not helped by the presence of equally annoying characters and a complete lack of satisfying resolution. Placing dramatic weight on these stories was a poor choice on Watanabe's part, and they just don't hold up to that weight at all.But while I may complain about this show, I won't call it a total loss or even a great loss at all, for there were still some things I loved about it. The main trio works quite well as a set of comic foils, and even in the most abysmal episodes I often found myself laughing at the interplay between them. On top of everything, Jin is quite compelling as a character, and his backstory as an exiled swordsman (\"ronin\") suits his lonely and stoic personality perfectly. At times, he feels like the only person in the show with much of a conscience or a believable personality, and he is the only one who undergoes any noticeable revelations; I must say that I enjoyed almost every episode that focused on him. And while Fuu is a little too ditzy for my tastes, she's funny and intelligent enough to make me feel some warmth for her, and the jokes centering around her and her voracious appetite are some of the show's very best. I can't say the same about Mugen, sadly, and I don't think that the show ever really takes him out of being the violent, angry, and borderline-psychopathic \"berserker\" archtype. His snarling voice and his endless taunts and obscenities become quite grating by the end, and he, in truth, is the one weak link in a show that otherwise had strong characterization.The show is, all around, also quite impressive in terms of technical achievements, and I was particularly pleased by the musical score. The background music, a mishmash of light beats and appropriately atmospheric keyboards, suits the show perfectly, and the opening and ending themes (which are both accompanied by beautiful art) completely hit the mark in terms of the show's intended style. In particular, the ending theme, a spunky but soulful minor-key tune, was perfect for ending a viewing and, at times, forgetting about the show's more irritating moments. The animation is also solid, and I appreciated the touches of Edo-era art, especially the woodblock prints in the opening sequenece. However, the backgrounds are surprisingly dull (if reasonably detailed), and while the main characters have excellent designs, almost everyone else is unbelievably ugly. And while I won't fault people for wanting to make fun of Americans, I do have to say that none of us are anywhere near as grotesque as this show makes us out to be.\nI have to admit that my opinion of this series suffers from the fact that it feels depressingly inferior to Watanabe's other work, and I believe that it completely fails in its stated goal of being the first \"hip-hop\" driven anime. It certainly won't be the next stepping-stone in anime storytelling (as some critics make it out to be), and it's way too inconsistent, devoid of drive, and off-kilter to be taken too seriously. But having been entertained and brought to laughter a good amount, I don't feel like my time was wasted. Samurai Champloo is not a bad show; it's just little more than an enjoyable but pointless romp that doesn't hold up to the high expectations I originally had for it.",
        "Created by Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop fame, Samurai Champloo brings a similar style to the late Edo period Japan when a wandering ronin and a vagrant clash, only to be saved by a tea servant. Bound to help her on her quest, the three reluctantly set out to find the samurai who smells of sunflowers. A bit slower paced than Cowboy Bebop and swapping jazz for rap, the series can't help but draw comparisons to its predecessor. Two wandering warriors taking on bad guys with the aid of their female friend, and one of the lead warriors in the english dub is even voiced by Steve Blum who is famous for his portrayal of Spike Spiegel in the original Cowboy Bebop. Similar characters aside, Samurai Champloo has the same use of cool angles and fast paced cuts during fight scenes, and speaking of which the fight scenes are very cool. This series also makes significant more use of an overarching plot, its less episodic and generally leads towards a finale of sorts. If you want to see a cool anime about samurai and ninjas that still has some mysticism / magic but isn't as far gone as Naruto, Samurai Champloo has you covered. Would highly recommend as a classic for anime fans, but not near as high on the list as Cowboy Bebop, it is superior in my view. However, this is still quite good.",
        "\"Action packed, thrilling, and the music is like sweets to your ears\".I just can't put in words how amazing this anime was. The intro of this anime is legendary.The animation and artwork were smooth and fluid. Especially the fight scenes they were outta this world. The plot was quiet simple but it was very good, especially the ending which did not disappoint. The pacing was perfect, it wasn't too slow or too fast. They would give you a break in between every hype moments and let the viewer take a breathe. The tone or the vibe of this anime was amazing, it had its moments to be happy and moments to become sad and the moments that made me laugh, and especially the hip pop mixed in with it which got me hyped up. The music and sounds were absolutely amazing, the music producers did such a great job on that part. Samurai Champloo did a pretty excellent job representing Japan's Edo period and nothing seemed confusing or odd except for some of the technology. The characters were good and most characters were only one time characters except for the main trio.So overall I enjoyed Samurai Champloo very much, the consistency of this anime was amazing each episode has its own meaning and themes and I felt like most of the episodes were used to their full potential except for one or two. And I felt like some things were left unanswered. It did feel a bit too comical at times, and also I think we could have been brought closer with the main cast by having more emotional scenes and more about their origins.Memorable: So so Rewatchable: Likely..",
        "Take a rude crude breakdance-fighting dude with a bad attitude, a stoic \"by-the-book\" ronin and a spunky young waitress who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Throw them together into the sizzling wok of a world where ancient meets modern and stir in a wide array of other interesting characters.The entire structure of Samurai Champloo's setting, characters and story mirrors that of the Okinawan stir fry dish the show is named after. Mugen (the breakdance-fighting dude) and Jin (the ronin) are recruited by Fuu(the waitress), after she saves them from execution. Together they must journey through this intriguing new world of a stylized Edo Period on a quest to seek out a mysterious samurai who smells of sunflowers. The narrative follows more along the style of American TV series; episodes are largely stand-alone but with an overarching storyline to tie one episode to the next. Each episode gives a glimpse into this unique world as envisioned by director Shinichiro Watanabe while developing our 3 main characters' back-stories.On their own, each ingredient tastes great; each character has their own unique charm that really grows on you within the first episode alone. But it is their interactions with each other and the different situations they are thrown into what this \"dish\" is really about. The marvelous script weaves the 3 different personalities together in and out from one misadventure to the next, making for a wide mix of funny lighthearted moments with darker and even sad ones. The voice actors bring such chemistry to the the characters that it is easy to lose oneself in this show.(this is one of those few anime where the English dub actually sounded better than the Japanese voice track).To complete the dish, Shinichiro Watanabe garnishes Samurai Champloo with some of the most awesome animation, stunning action sequences and artwork seen in an anime series. Though not up to the standards of a animated movie, Samurai Champloo's animation is along the lines of a high budgeted OVA; fluid, smooth and with almost no reliance on the usual animation \"short-cuts\". A stunning achievement for the new anime studio \"Manglobe\". The artwork combines modern anime aesthetics with a style similar to the traditional Japanese paintings. A few action scenes look a little \"flat\" thanks to the stylized minimalist shading, but they do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the show.So once again, master \"chef\" Shinichiro Watanabe managed to produce one delectable delicacy of an anime series. A lip smacking blend of old and new, funny and serious; there is something to satisfy everyone in this series. A true spiritual successor to his 90s hit \"Cowboy bebop\" and easily a time honored classic in the making. This is a \"must have\" for any anime fan with a taste for great stories.",
        "There are very few anime that I love more than Samurai Champloo. I find every bit of it perfect, from the OST, to the characters; and in my opinion, it's Watanabe's best work. So, to start off the review, I want to talk about the best part about the show.Easy the best part of Samurai Champloo are its characters. There are three main characters, Jin, Mugen, and Fuu. Jin and Mugen are both samurai, and that's the only similarity between the two. Jin's fighting style is quick and orthodox, whereas Mugen is erratic and unorthodox. Both also have very different personalities, Jin being calm and stoic, Mugen being devious and disobedient. Both characters complete opposite, but both being equally cool and likable. Fuu, is the character that holds Jin and Mugen together to help push the plot. She's bossy and naive, which plays well to her character.The plot of Samurai Champloo is quite simple; it's about the journey of three characters to find a samurai that smells of sunflowers. Samurai Champloo is all about the journey; who they meet and the stories that come with those strangers. My favorite episode is ep 11. It has all the best parts about Samurai champloo into one episode.The OST is one of the best in all of anime. It's lo-fi hip hop, which surprisingly works perfectly with the samurai theme. It's slow and calming, and when added to the melancholic atmosphere, you get a tone that you'd only get from Samurai Champloo.In the end, Samurai Champloo is one of the best anime of all time. Seeing the friendship build up between the characters each episode is so satisfying, and at the end of the show, it's bittersweet. Samurai Champloo is an anime that I'd recommend to someone who doesn't even watch anime, it's that good.",
        "\"Samurai Champloo\" a very good anime to watch casually.Often not much happens, except that the 3 main characters roam through the countries.In between, an adventure awaits them and then their journey continues.The story is simple and quite easy to understand.The character developments aren't really there either, but that's not all that bad, because Samurai Champloo doesn't really want to be any of that.Like I said, it's just an anime to sit back and let it sink in.I also really liked the drawing style, because it stands out and thus provides something new for tired eyes.I got through the 26 episodes faster than I would have liked.If you need a break from \"heavy\" series with umpteen plot twists and a number of fights with exhaustingly complex animation, you're well served with \"Samurai Champloo\".",
        "Lovely show will recommend this to others, great ride.",
        "I wouldn't really consider myself a big fan of anime, having only seen about 50 titles to date (mostly theatrical films). I have enjoyed a majority of the ones I've seen (especially the Studio Ghibli line), but most of them haven't blown me away. I'm one of those blasphemous fiends who finds great enjoyment in anime that *real* fans of anime don't like very much. You know, stuff like \"Vexille\" (2007), \"Appleseed\" (2004), and \"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\" (2005) \u2013 movies that everyone likes to rip apart even though they're far more entertaining than most of the artsy fartsy stuff that finds its way onto everyones top lists. I've also disliked and even hated a number of highly acclaimed titles. You know, stuff like \"Akira\" (1987), \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" (1995), \"Grave of the Fireflies\" (1998), and \"Princess Mononoke\" (1997) \u2013 titles that get endless reverence for reasons that I simply do not understand. For myself personally, anime is like a mine field because I really have no idea whether or not I'm gonna hit a pretentous, irritating mess.This past weekend I had no Asian dvds to watch, which is a rarity. So I did some online research and came across a series by the name of \"Samurai Champloo\" (2004). Like every other anime series, it got really high ratings and everyone went on and on about how awesome it was \u2013 yada yada yada. I rolled my eyes. Then I noticed that it was created by the same team that brought us \"Cowboy Bebop\" (1998), an anime that I recently finished and enjoyed very much. On that fact alone I decided to take a chance. I purchased the Complete DVD collection at a local store, and ended up finishing the entire series (a 10 hour project) in one day.Fuu, a waitress who works in a teahouse, rescues two master swordsmen, Mugen and Jin, from their execution to help her find the \"samurai who smells of sunflowers.\" Along the way they meet a lot of people and get involved in various conflicts. This is one of the few anime that I've seen that exhibits superior quality in every single aspect of film-making. The animation itself is stunning, with incredibly beautiful environments on constant display, and the Japanese voiceacting is top notch. The two biggest positives, however, are the character development and the swordfights.With regards to the former, I must give some serious props to the scriptwriter, who crafts some fantastic characters here with very distinct, engaging histories. These are expertly developed characters who come to life. As much as I enjoyed \"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex GIG 1 & 2\" (2002, 2004), I always felt that the characters were too dry and textbook. Not so in \"Samurai Champloo\", which introduces its characters in a very warm, endearing manner while using a hefty amount of witty comedy that bonds them with the viewer as well as each other. It was also an excellent decision to have a very slow, methodical bonding process that basically takes the entire runtime before culminating in a family-type relationship. This makes perfect sense given their cynical histories, and comes off as entirely convincing. By the end the viewer will have no choice but to be emotionally invested in their lives, which maximizes the impact of the final 6 or 7 episodes when they confront some formidable opponents.That brings us to the swordfighting scenes, which are without question the greatest I've ever seen in an animated film or show. The quality of the action choreography is high throughout, but the last 6 or 7 episodes will completely blow you away. We're talking multiple showdowns with bad guys who are so intimidating that one questions the well-being of the protagonists, who are considerably talented in their own right. What results is what I call \"superlative awesomeness\" that will have the viewer on the edge of their seat for virtually every single second. If you thought the swordfights in \"Ninja Scroll\" (1993) were good, you've GOT to see this! A truly magnificent, exhilarating experience.I still have much to see in the realm of anime, but it's gonna be tough to top \"Samurai Champloo.\" I'm completely and whole-heartedly in love with this the same way I'm in love with \"My Sassy Girl\" (2001, South Korea) as a romantic comedy or \"Kairo\" (2001, Japan) as a horror movie. A must see by any common definition of the term.10/10",
        "As a kid, I saw bits and pieces of this series on Adult Swim when I used to sleep over at friend's house who had cable. Although I saw the English dub first, I have to say that the Japanese dub is the superior and more fun dub of this series. When you have the voice of the Japanese Zorro that's one of the main characters it's bound to be good.The action, the writing and the pacing of the series is beyond great. I honestly can't believe how good is this series is, and even how it ended. I'm not going to spoil how it ended. But I will say that this series is by far one of the best animes that has been put out there since Cowboy Bebop. It's offbeat, fun and extremely entertaining as well as motivational and uplifting at times too. The character development in this series is just perfect. I really wish that American directors, that make film and television would take a note from Japanese anime and understand that people can deal with complex storylines, and that silence is golden and very useful. Directors used to understand this, but unfortunately the number of directors that understand the power of Silence, good writing, good direction and great characters as well as character development are dwindling in number, but hopefully we'll have better series oh, but who knows? All I know is that I find myself watching more and more foreign language films and series and finding that they are more interesting and intriguing then most American TV and film.",
        "Oddball anime that should be plain annoying, but somehow manages to captivate. Fuu, a young girl, encounters two Samurai whilst in a small tea shop. They are as different as can be, and intent on killing one another, but Fuu manages to convince them to go on one last quest before slicing each other up. The mission? To find 'The Samurai who smells of sunflowers,' a figure Fuu is desperate to locate, for reasons that I don't want to spoil here. The characters are well crafted. Fuu: sweet, world-innocent yet precocious. Jin: a traditionalist, proud of his martial arts abilities and utterly focused. Mugen: a layabout who just happens to be gifted in the ways of Samurai swordplay, mainly due to his ultra-competitiveness. Their quest takes them the length of Japan and this reveals their adventures along the way. Mixing old world stylings with ultra-modern sensibilities this is an odd mix but, on the whole, it works, monks singing hip-hop notwithstanding. Classed as a comedy, at times this is laugh out loud funny, whilst at others the humour, for a Westerner at least, falls flat and simply irritates. Indeed, the episodes I rate as lowest are without exception the knockabout, zany episodes. Likable and charming, though not without a healthy dose of violence and bloodshed, I sense this is one only for the anime initiated. If just starting out on your anime adventure, I'd look elsewhere before sampling this curio.",
        "A largely episodic narrative, Samurai Champloo follows an unlikely trio comprising of a teenage girl Fuu and two samurais Mugen and Jin as they engage in a quest while encountering numerous adventures along their journey. While it does have an overarching story, the anime specifically shines in its blending of characterization, fight choreography, music, art and animation in the many independent subplots. The contrast between the colourful characters is brought out beautifully through the diverse scenarios and settings that also reveal individual backstories. Elements of Japanese history are woven well into the writing. The soundtrack and its use to heighten emotion as well as hype action scenes is especially noteworthy.While it was entertaining enough, the show also lends itself to many criticisms. The culminaton and resolution of the quest are both predictable and unsatisfactory. Most of the episodic plots are formulaic and repetitive - a representative storyline goes as follows: the group is hungry and must earn money for food and lodging, Fuu is kidnapped, hotheaded Mugen fights and defeats some petty thugs and villains, stoic Jin finds less confrontational solutions, Fuu is re-united with her comrades and they escape. During these events, characters also don't seem to have significant growth but remain their one-note selves even if they learn to confront their past demons. Furthermore, perhaps due to the show's episodic structure, the lack of a notable antagonist is apparent. Lastly, as more of a pet peeve, the rapid snazzy camera cuts are more of a detriment to the presentation than adding any cinematic appeal.Despite these personal gripes and grievances of mine, Samurai Champloo is an enjoyable adventure story. Its strengths are its memorable character cast, excellently-animated action elements and melodious soundtrack. If those aspects appeal to you, then you are likely to find the show a captivating and rewarding watch.",

This unlikely and volatile trio begin a road journey through post-shogunate Japan (ca. 1780), brought together by circumstances best seen to be believed.\"Champloo\" means mixed-up or stir-fry, and that's what this series is: a stylish blend of old school values and situations, meshed with more modern sensibilities, fighting styles, and visual design.Champloo is many things: a mature drama, an action series, an uproariously funny comedy and a visual feast. You will not be disappointed, despite how radically mind blowing it is.Just watch it.",
        "Samurai Champloo proves director Shinichiro Watanabe to be a fantastic anime creator and will be remembered as some of his best work. It's an easy series to watch (seeing as it's only 26 episodes) and is a must-watch for anyone that's a fan of great storytelling through Japanese animation.The series focuses on three characters: Fuu, Mugen, and Jin as they travel across Japan in search of samurai who smells of sunflowers. Each episode, for the most part, is a story in and of itself about a little piece of their journey. The word \"Champloo\" is an Okinawa-based word for \"stir-fry\" and my does it fit! The series is a wonderful \"stir-fry\" mixture of samurai/characters with great depth and style of its own.What makes Samurai Champloo a great series isn't just the variety of characters and stylistic story-telling. It's the compelling nature of the plots and the pure enjoyment a die-hard anime fan will have when watching these colorful characters interact and clash with each other. Each episode never fails to leave room for boredom and although some episodes don't dive deep into character's back stories/connect directly to the main story arc, it's unceasingly fascinating and enjoyable. The series also manages to not only successfully mix up a variety of characters, but also a variety of genres so beautifully and seamlessly. One moment the viewer could be on the edge of their seat with a thrilling action sequence, the next they could be laughing aloud to a joke a character told. The stories blend action, adventure, comedy, and drama beautifully while giving some seasonings of horror, fantasy, and maybe noir. While the show is fantastic it does have some arguable flaws that not everyone might agree on. For instance, from episode one, the viewer jumps right into the fun and action without knowing too much about our three main characters. Waiting for back story in future episodes, fans might be slightly let down by that promise being fulfilled. Adequate back story is indeed present but maybe not as much as some might be hungry for. Some episodes also feel out of place and could potentially not be necessary for the overall story arc. As state before however, these episodes are still always entertaining and very fun to rematch. Flaws one could see in this show might cause it to not arrive at the number one spot of every anime fan's favorites list but the series is still incredibly cool and worth watching (and probably owning) for any fan. It's never dull and it's a great series that comes highly recommended. Some of the best 650 minutes you'll eat up by watching this wonderfully animated series.",
        "The anime has the setting of the Edo time period of Japan and it is surprising how perfectly the Hip hop music matches with this kind of a setting. Not only the opening song, Battlecry gives you the elegant vibes, the other songs like Small Circle of Friends and San Francisco are just as catchy. Even the non-hip hop songs like Shiki no Uta, Who's theme and Obokuri-Eeumi in the Okinawan dialect give you the feelings of the 90s nostalgia. The OSTs which are played during the fight scenes or the deep conversations are really well made and perfectly suit to those respective scenes. Nujabes has been widely praised for the Samurai Champloo soundtrack and very rightly so. In terms of quality, this soundtrack is second to none(Okay, maybe second only to Naruto's). This anime has made me appreciate the Japanese Hip hop even though I have never found the conventional Western Hip hop interesting.Having the setting of Edo Japan, the anime has several historical references. While there is some accuracy in it, most of it is just for fun. The story revolves around Mugen, Jin and Fuu as they journey across Japan trying to find \"The samurai who smells of sunflowers.\" In their journey, they experience all sorts of crazy things, get into trouble and try to make money or find the means to survive as long as they are traveling together. As the show progresses, the mysteries of the characters' pasts are slowly revealed. The anime has a bittersweet ending. Once their motives are all achieved, the three characters go on their separate paths. Yet, it doesn't really intend to make us feel emotional. In an elegant manner and using the Hip hop style, they just ask us to carry on whilst playing the song 'San Francisco.'The characters are so damn interesting. I was shocked to see the character of Mugen. It was nothing like any other main character. As a self-taught and ruthless swordsman, he just doesn't know how to hold back. Not only is he arrogant but always looks to pick up meaningless fights and wouldn't mind brutally injuring or killing others. His past is beautifully explored though. You would understand from where he got such beasty personality. Jin has noted that it is surprising how a reckless and impulsive man like him is still alive. Despite traveling together and having minimum hatred for each other, Mugen and Jin wish to kill each other someday. Despite Jin being just as cold on a contrary, he is much wiser and calculating samurai. Rarely losing his stoic exterior, he doesn't bother sharing his past, his motives, his mysteries or even his basic feelings with Mugen and Fuu. He does however manage to fall in love with a woman, who taught him how to cook Eel. Fuu, despite being cheerful and a foody woman, too has her own motives. In fact, the main storyline of this show entirely depends on what she is upto or on the factors responsible for her actions or decisions. Fuu seems to be much more sensible than Mugen and Jin, something that allows her to trick even such cold men and make them work for her.Few episodes are only for the references sake. So don't be shocked when you see the main characters apparently dying just for them to appear well and alive in the very next episode as if nothing was happened to them. I am pretty sure most of the people won't take it positively. Nevertheless, the things that matter the most are fabulously done. For instance, the scene in which we see Mugen drowning and we get to see the glimpses of his past life. Not only was the scene emotional, nicely animated and perfectly executed, but the song Obokuri-Eeumi makes it look even more beautiful and deep. The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed as well. Some of those managing to trigger the characters' philosophies or deep thoughts really make the show look more interesting.The elegance of Samurai Champloo has managed to amaze me and even the ending was done in such a way that the completion of the anime feels totally satisfying. I will praise it endlessly but on the other hand, I will also have no complaints if it doesn't have the season 2.",
        "Shin'ichiro Watanabe did it again. After He already proofed his own style of art in \"Cowboy Bebop\" he nailed it again few years later with \"Samurai Champloo\". I could never decide which one of them both I prefer but it's sure to say that Champloo doesn't need to hide and can easily keep up with its big brother. The visual style is top notch and just so is the musical background. Where \"Cowboy Bebop\" relied on old jazz and blues \"Samurai Champloo\" goes for Hip Hop and does that in a beautiful way of using old school lo-fi Beats to underlay the scenery of old edo Japan. The Story is great as well I don't want to spoiler anything but let me say that this isn't your average Anime story about fighting and being the best at it. It covers deep philosophical topics and does that with brilliance. I loved all characters featured in this show and the humorous style they often display.\nThis show just got it all great characters, good storytelling, and a beautiful visual frame that captures all of this. This show made my laugh and cry, both in one episode in some cases.\n10/10"

    "Nodame Cantabile": [
        "One thing I can say about this series is that it's an expensive production with no efforts spared to improve the quality of the show. The actors are top notch, and music is portrayed accurately with interesting points captured to highlight the talents of the performers.Shinichi Chiaki (Hiroshi Tamaki) is a talented music school student studying piano. His reputation is near cult level amongst the students. Combined with his good looks, he has many girls (and even a boy) enamored with him. One day under duress, he finds himself in his next door neighbor's apartment. His neighbor turns out to be Noda Megumi or Nodame (Juli Ueno) also a student studying piano in his school. She a perfect slob and her room is filled with garbage, and can't even find her own bed. Nodame was a child prodigy and can play almost any music without reading the music, but due to unfortunate incident during her childhood, has no aspiration to improve on her talent. Her goal is to become a preschool teacher. They meet, and Nodame comes to rely on Chiaki. She visits his apartment for food, to borrow a bath (because gas in her apartment has been stopped for non payment of monthly fees), and any excuse to be close to him. Chiaki has one weakness - due to a childhood trauma, he can't take a plane or a boat trip. This prevents him from going aboard to study in great European conservatories. One day a great conductor Frantz Strezemann (Naoto Takenaka) shows up at their school. He's a terrible womanizer but his true reason for coming to their school is - to teach Chiaki (On behest of the school's headmaster). Chiaki is a senior but he decides to change his major from pianist to a conductor. Strezemann starts to collect a rag tag team of flunky (but talented) students to form an orchestra and puts Chiaki in charge as its conductor. Chiaki while disgusted with the lack of discipline of the orchestra, with his talent and devotion, makes it into a credible ensemble of performers. In the mean time Nodame's talent is also discovered and she gets the training that she really deserves, but the only one who's not too excited about it is Nodame herself.This is a delightful love comedy played on the back of an inspiring story about two talented musician's way to becoming world class performers. The show is both entertaining and inspiring. Hiroshi Tamaki captures the mood of world class composer in training perfectly, and Juli Ueno plays the unlikely partner to the perfectionist Tamaki portrays. One of best comedy drama to come out of Asia of all times, it's highly recommended for viewing along with its \"Europe TV Speciall\" and the two \"Nodame Final part 1 and 2\" movies. An English subtitled version is available for all audiences.",
        "Variety of plot is what japanese drama excel kdrama. This time it is music and drama. Not only is the plot enchanting, the acting of leads is amazing. Female lead is magnetic. She fits perfectly to the role of a fussy piano student. Together with the cool male lead they makes up a perfect pair.A must see for Jdrama.",
        "When I started watching this I didn't have very high expectations. But this is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable TV series I've ever watched. It is based on a manga, and a lot of the manga aesthetic -and even acting- comes through.Chiaki is an extremely talented, motivated, efficient and arrogant piano player whose real dream is to become a conductor. However, his fear of flying means he cannot travel to Europe to study under the masters. Oh, Chiaki is also extremely handsome, making him the hottest boy in school.Nodame is his next-door neighbour. Although she is equally talented, she has no inclination to be a professional. She would rather raid people's lunch boxes, play silly songs on the piano and live a carefree life in her extremely messy bedroom.They study at the same music school, and alongside them are a whole range of characters: Chiaki's girlfriend Saiko, perverted conductor Strezemann, the eccentrically gay Masumi, rock violinist Eita, calm & cool beauty Asami, and at least two orchestras' worth of characters.As the story develops Chiaki learns to become more human, and Nodame learns to appreciate her exceptional talent.The series fits into the \"achievement\" genre, a bit like all those sports films where the underdog eventually wins. But the fact that it's done through comedy makes it much more enjoyable and far less presumptuous. The use of music is also inspired, and if I may say so, very informative. Until I saw this series I really thought a conductor simply moved the stick to the rhythm of the music. I have also learnt to appreciate classical music much more than I ever did before. I may even go to see an orchestra now.Anyway, all in all a very enjoyable series. Overall the acting was excellent, technically the film is great (apart from some odd sudden changes in the colour correction), and it is a delight for the ears.",
        "'Nodame cantabile' is a series that will sweep you off your feet. This is an anime that actually does not follow the drag pattern that a lot of other anime seem to follow. It's fresh, different and completely entertaining. The series is based on western classical music. I think the makers were really trying to help the ignorant modern audience see the brilliance of classical music. If that was their goal, I must say, they have achieved what they set out to achieve. Sure the series is about the characters and the story. But as we progress through the episodes, it becomes more and more about the music. We find ourselves watching the episodes to listen to the music, while we follow the story. I did not think it was really possible to give the 'cliffhanger' treatment to this kind of a story. It is genius. My advice would be, watch the first 12 episodes and stop, give it time to sink in, then go on to watching the rest. I happened to come across the anime in one of my extensive web searches, when I frantically look for anime that actually make sense. I am so glad I decided to give this one a shot.",
        "Nodame Kantabire is a live action off shoot of the manga by Tomoko Ninomiya, which also has an animated counter part.Overall this series keeps in the spirit of both the original work and the animated work in comical antics and gags, which are quite enjoyable to watch.The cast is full of incredible actors, Ueno Juri portrays the unique and often times quirky Noda Megumi with the up most talent, while Hiroshi Tamaki does a an excellent job playing Chiaki Shinichi. The most notable actor is Ogawa Shinji, his over the top performance of Franz Von Stresemann is a sight to behold and most memorable in my opinion. The cast gives a great performance to bring out each individual character. You can not help but fall in love with the characters in the show.The live action series deviates on some musical pieces that are performed and selected from the original work and animation, but nonetheless are great musical pieces to hear. Should not pose a problem in watching the series.Tomoko Ninomiya does her homework with musical history, references, and technical term. Unless your an uptight classical musician you would learn a thing or two about classical music and be happy with it.You will not be disappointed if you decide to watch this series. I highly recommend it."

    "Ergo Proxy": [
        "I did take notice of the 2006 Anime back when it was released, but I never actually got around to watching it before now in 2023.And it turns out that I hadn't been missing out on anything grand. Sure, \"Ergo Proxy\" was watchable, but it wasn't anything outstanding, and I actually found the narrative a bit slow paced and somewhat boring. And that made it a rather difficult task to sit through 23 episodes of it.The art style in \"Ergo Proxy\" was good, as was the animation they used.I watched the original Japanese released version, which I prefer, because dubbed versions usually lower the overall enjoyment of something for me. And I will say that the voice acting in \"Ergo Proxy\" was good. I wasn't familiar with the voices of any of the performers here.This Anime series is not something I will return to watch a second time.My rating of \"Ergo Proxy\" lands on a four out of ten stars.",
        "Set in the distant future this series is centred on Re-L Meyer; a member of the 'Citizen Intelligence Bureau' who is investigating a series of brutal murders. It is believed that they are being carried out by robots, known as 'auto-reivs', that have been infected by the Cognito virus which gives them self-awareness. While investigating she comes across a powerful creature that she learns is called a 'Proxy'; determined to discover what it is she follows immigrant Vincent Law as he leaves the domed city of Romdo. He has lost his memories but believes he can find out about his past if he goes to his old home; another domed city so he heads there along with Re-L and an infected auto-riev called Pino.If you are looking for a fast paced action packed series then this is not it; the pace is slow but this serves to allow the viewer to soak up the atmosphere and get immersed into the story. The animation looks stunning; giving a sense of beauty even to the desolation we frequently see. It also blends 3D elements with the 2D almost seamlessly so it didn't jar at all. As the series progresses we gradually learn more about the world we are watching; from the different nature of humanity to the mysterious Proxies. The three main characters are interesting; Re-L has a fragility that we don't usually see in a female protagonist; Vincent is mysterious and conflicted and somewhat surprisingly young auto-riev Pino feels the most human of all the characters. While these three are the main characters the secondary characters are also well fleshed out. Overall I'd say if you like your anime dark and dystopian you should love this.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "The problem with this anime is continuity. The first episode is very techy, political and confusing;a few others are going towards mystical; some others are introverted mind incursions or little more than travel episodes (they went, they saw, they left). The atmosphere changes as well, from scary and dark to weird or cute.But the show is innovative and worth watching. A thing I liked and I didn't really see in other animes is a little reference at the end of each show with the symbols used. I mean, they incorporated their vision of different artworks or opinions into specific episodes, then they explain it. The presented world is very fragmented, so in each episode they get to do different things. That's not particularly a good thing, but if you liked StarTrek... ;)The soundtrack is not some silly Japanese-American adolescent song, but sung by RadioHead. The atmosphere can be really dark and I liked that. They manage to create psychological discomfort without strange sounds or lots of blood, which is also good.All and all, a good attempt, but I am really wondering how and if it's going to end. The scope of the story is so vast that I can't imagine a satisfying end yet. Also some premises (mainly the Proxy thing) I don't like/get yet. But hey, it's only been 14 episodes. Keep the faith! :)",
        "So here we go again with another piece of Japanese animation (Anime') that serves a purpose as a total mind-f**k experience. I just got done watching the Japanese Anime' series \"Ergo Proxy\" yesterday and I'm up right now, at 7:00 A.M. writing about it, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around some things.First of all, it goes without saying that this is a very intelligent Anime', produced by the studio Manglobe, and skillfully written by Dai Sato and a team of other writers, and directed by Shukuo Murase. When watching \"Ergo Proxy,\" it helps for the viewer to abandon all known concepts of reality and straightforward storytelling to focus on a confusing (but intelligent, wow-oh-wow) storyline. (Can't think of many Anime' pieces that don't have some sort of absolute gosh-wow factor.)With accompanying beginning and ending theme songs by Monoral (\"Kiri\") and Radiohead (\"Paranoid Android\"), respectively, and an out-there creepy sci-fi soundtrack by Yoshihiro Ike, \"Ergo Proxy\" is set some time in the distant future, when planet Earth has become so uninhabitable because of a worldwide ecological disaster that human beings are forced to live in massive domed cities. One of these domed cities is Romdo, where inspector Re-L Mayer is investigating murders committed by auto-reivs (robots built by humans to help with everyday tasks) infected by an out-of-control virus called the \"Cogito Virus,\" which causes machines to become self-aware. Since machines aware of their own existence are seen as a threat capable of upsetting Romdo's delicate social balance and order, disposal units are given the tasks of destroying any and all infected auto-reivs.In the course of her investigation, Re-L is attacked by a hideous, deformed humanoid monster in her apartment, after the creature had scrawled a cryptic message on her mirror. In searching for answers, she learns that the creature, called a \"proxy,\" may have escaped from a government facility where it was being experimented on because it is believed that this being holds the key to the survival of mankind. Re-L later finds herself (along with her Entourage auto-reiv Iggy), by events too complicated to reveal here, linked to the mysterious Vincent Law and the Cogito-infected Companion auto-reiv Pino, and on a journey outside the city's walls into the wastelands of planet Earth.Just to get pretenses out of the way, \"Ergo Proxy\" is a visually astounding Anime', mixing two-dimensional cell animation with computer-generated imagery and special effects. The plot-line is even more astounding, with a number of deep philosophical undertones meant to question the role memory plays in developing individual identity. There are plenty of moments when you sit back and say, \"What the f**k?\" - just as characters often find themselves questioning who they are in long, drawn-out soliloquies (like those in any play you can think of written by Shakespeare).I've been watching the \"Ergo Proxy\" series for almost a year now and I still find it to be uniquely entertaining stuff. The series at first appears to be another typical Anime' with humans and androids living together and an inevitable conflict arising from their tensions of coexistence, but then a curve ball (more like, curve balls) comes at you fast from left field, catapulting you somewhere you didn't expect to be. Tensions can rise between the viewer and the confusing storytelling narrative, with a number of episodes that seem sporadic and out-of-place (such as the characters appearing as contestants on a life-or-death game show, or Vincent Law experiencing a bunch of random flashbacks in one of the most confusing episodes of the series). But upon closer inspection (more like, deep meditation) of those \"questionable\" episodes, I've found that they serve a purpose just as the main storyline does, perhaps, sometimes, even more a greater purpose than the general episodes.All of this adds up to a \"What the f**k\" mind-blowing experience and what some may call a rather cheap and confusing ending. But what \"Ergo Proxy\" has going for it is a deep and intelligent narrative, properly fleshed out because of Dai Sato and his legion of skilled and thoughtful screenwriters.10/10",
        "Ergo Proxy is an animated, cyberpunk, Japanese, Sci-Fi TV series (which was created by Manglobe Productions in 2006).Set 1000 years (??) in the future (in the domed city of Romdo) - Ergo Proxy's bleak, creepy, sinister story (where pale, ghostly citizens abound) tells the tale of humans coexisting with robots.An unknown virus called \"Cogito\" soon infects the robots which (guess what?) gives them self-awareness and, with that, they inevitably resort to murderous violence. (natch)Mixing 2-D cel-animation with 3-D computer modelling - \"Ergo Proxy\" was, overall, fairly entertaining, though its story-lines did tend to be somewhat uneven and pretty predictable in the clich\u00e9d realm of Sci-Fi.",

Also, the voice cast was also good.That is all I have to say.",
        "The animation is beautiful, the voice acting so so, but the serie for 23 episodes failed to entertain in a big way, from the looks of all the high ratings lots of people like boredom. The first few episode where very good, until they reach the desolation land and then its slips into a very boring, time wasting series where almost nothing happens and by episode 10 you lose total interest in the series.I fast forwarded the rest of the episode and until i reach the end at episode 23 where i was already tired of this failure.",
        "Written by Dai Sato (Cowboy Bebop), Ergo Proxy follows Re-l, a detective set to investigate a series of murders committed by AutoReivs, the city's robot inhabitants that have recently started acting independently of humans due to an infection with the cogito virus. Things turn suspect to a new immigrant in town, Vincent Law, when this strangers appearance begins coinciding with appearances of a new Proxy, a god-like being little is known about. Seemingly in the dome city created for the protection of mankind from the now destroyed wastelands of Earth, Re-l must travel to new lands to find the causes of these murders and unravel the mystery of the proxies. A long winded description sure, this series blew me away. Heavy dystopian, grungy, and gnostic vibes, the series asks a lot of heavy philosophical questions about identity, consciousness, and the purpose of god. Quite slow and methodic, and certainly very dense, this is a series you must pay close attention to, they do very little hand holding for the overarching plot, often with key information being conveyed a single time in a seemingly throwaway line of exposition. Dramatic and tense throughout, I loved the series art style and subdued approach when compared to many other more flashy anime of the time. If you're looking for something thats designed to really make you think, and don't mind a lot of dialogue, I would highly recommend this series which must be considered a classic.",
        "What struck me most when i started watching this was the art work, it was beautiful. But very quickly the story really sucked me in. This is a classic anime and is a much watch. The story conclusion is not the strong point, but the mystery was. It keep you wondering, what was this all about. The ending can be confusing and you are always thinking, if i was that characters i would not be doing that. But that means you are fully engaged.",

        "Normally, I don't like much Anime because most of it is either kiddie soap opera, or worse, soft Kiddie porn, or even more worse-- Nasty Kiddie Porn. Ergo Proxy first off-- Has Absolutely NONE of the usual penchant for Kiddie porn, graphic violence and even worse-- graphic sexual violence that usually permeates Japanese Anime. So for those of you for whom this matters-- there it is. This series is CLEAN.What Ergo Proxy does give you is a complex layered story filled with terms and concepts that, by design, hearken to philosophical, intellectual, and literary tenets for which I can only describe the creators as being perfectly ARTISTIC Ivory Tower Snobs.The saving grace from the snobbery is the fact that the creators were totally skilled in the ability to layer the story in such a way that the unfolding of the story reveals the connections. And these connections go beyond the up-front mysteries of: WHAT happened to the Earth and What ARE Proxies?Re-L and Vincent Law -- (Note the allusions already?) -- are traveling from RomDo to another failed city to find answers to what Vincent is. And along the way, they will meet other creatures, proxies, strange entities and wild 'entourages' (Note another allusion) And for those of you who are scratching your heads over the weird little girl android: The fact that she's feckless, fey and plays an electronic pipe should ring a BELL. If you can make that connection-- You.Are.SMART. Give yourself a Star: You ARE an Intellectual. The beauty of this series is you go from episode to episode to hear another piece of the puzzle explained. And as each puzzle piece is revealed the growing picture becomes stranger and stranger. In short-- this is not your average Post-Apocalyptic adventure. It's a weird, wonderful exploration of a strange new world.Note I call this an adult anime not because of x-rated content: there is NONE. I call it adult because this is Animation for THINKING Adults. And even better-- this Series works seamlessly in English. So watch it and enjoy.Oh-- and this Anime series IS a Deadly Girlfriend Test. Use it with care, guys!",
        "Terrible watch, very confusing, I was trying to make sense of it till the end but everything was muddled. It starts off on an interesting dystopia world having lots of mystery but I feel the writer didn't know where to go from that point on. As the series progressed it becomes duller and I had to force myself to watch it so as to complete the series. The pacing is very slow, for a 23 episodes series it has to many fillers, the middle episodes had no relation to the main plot and the ending ones seemed rushed. The whole series seemed to be full of discrepancies, even the animation of the protagonist, the way his face changes from chubby guy to chiseled face just didn't make sense. I watched the English dubbed version and it has one of the worst lip sync and dialogs ever written for an anime.I don't know the reason for the series having such a high rating as I felt it's one of the worst stuff I have seen.",
        "\"Ergo Proxy\" (2006) = 8.6\nVery interesting show. My only real problem with Ergo Proxy is that the pacing is a bit outta whack. The plot advanced way, way too quickly in the period before Vincent left Rondo, taking a good six or seven episodes of content and mushing it into three. From there, the pace just got slower and slower. Occasionally, the plot would seem to jump very suddenly, only to reveal that whatever new plot seemed to have occurred was merely a hallucination or a dream or a god damn'd game show that remainex completely unexplained for the rest of the damn show. However, I prasie this series. It made me think and conveyed new ideas to me, which hasn't happened in far too long-not because of an anime, at least. Ergo Proxy made me further consider the concept of God, a sole creator, and the properties of such a being-his duty, his solitude, and his anguish-and the concept of creation itself. This is a very, very thoughtful story with an equal thoughtful theme, and I walk away from it with nothing but satisfaction and gratitude.\"The shadow knows. The shadow knows the price to pay and the fate of those who demand a god for a godless world.\"",
        "The anime is about the journey of a woman, Re-L Mayer, who is an important member of the Intelligence Bureau and a mysterious man named Vincent LawThe plot is weird. In the middle of the series, some of the episodes are confusing and don't add any useful information to the plot. I personally think that that they are still very enjoyable and contains the best epic of the series. The last two episodes is a mess and it does a messy job in concluding the story. I think the plot is also great because it is very experimental, and this anime is not afraid to try new things. I also think it's very entertaining.The characters are interesting but not very likeable. Most of the characters and irritating and pompous. Pino is the most likeable character and even she is annoying sometimes.The animation is average and is good enough for me.I prefer the Dub to the Sub. The Dub's Voice acting was excellent and it has one of the best voice acting, I have ever seen, in Anime.I would recommend it to people interested in Cyberpunk.",
        "'Ergo Proxy' at first appeared like an edgy SciFi thriller, a true child of the 2000s. We got the protagonist with an attitude, vivid blue eyeshadow, a black outfit, and a cat-ear haircut; we got the post-apocalyptic setting with a seemingly utopian dystopia; we got the bleak colours and bleak atmosphere; we even got the Radiohead song as a main theme. It was perhaps not truly excellent but certainly interesting, and I liked the first seven episodes well enough.Unfortunately, the series quickly devolved into pseudo-philosphical discussions about gods and pain and despair. There's anime-typical fights where people are thrown into walls to leave a crater, where inhuman looking creatures growl at each other through their sheer anime-ness. At one point, a literal angel makes an appearance, white wings carrying her to Heaven.Reading the other reviews, there seem to be many people who liked the transition from a SciFi thriller to a poastapocalyptic road story to a pseudo-theological melodrama. I can't count myself among them, but even if I did accept this flawed change of genre, there're still a bunch of episodes that add little to the overall plot. Three of them stick out in particular: episode 15 without any rhyme or reason is a Quiz show; episode 19 is a Disney-esque (fever) dream sequence, and episode 16 is a legitimate masterpiece of dry humour.Do I recommend watching 'Ergo Proxy'? No. Nevertheless I didn't find the time spent on this series completely wasted; the female protagonist was at least refreshingly new and interesting (unlike the male protagonist), the worldbuilding was well executed and sensible (unlike the plot), the backgrounds were gorgeous if a bit too desaturated for my taste, and a few episodes were genuinely good. In total, the many flaws piled up too much for me to truly appreciate 'Ergo Proxy'; in all honesty, I'm glad that I'm now finished and can watch something a bit more entertaining.",
        "Ergo Proxy owes quite a bit to the 1960s series The Prisoner. This becomes apparent near the end of the series. It also utilizes elements of Ghost in the Shell, Logan's Run, and Blade Runner.The art style is excellent and so is the music. Pacing's good, characters are interesting, and the sense of atmosphere helps to create an immersive world for the viewer to dwell in.Lots of references to mythological and historical figures, along with some notable philosophers and thinkers. They even visually explain (near the end) why Daedalus has the name he has as his creation flies 'too close to the sun.'For people who enjoyed Ghost in the Shell and the atmosphere of manga/anime like Blame!, I think you'll also enjoy this one too.Both the Japanese and English versions are good. However, if you want a darker experience, try watching it in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "Very well done and worth watching! At least for us who like this anime genre. But truly story, artwork, characters... Very well rounded altogether!",
        "I am not an avid anime consumer and to be honest I don't like a lot of it - maybe it's a cultural thing because I am not Japanese - but I have seen enough anime to know Ergo Proxy stands out in a big way. The animation, writing, and title music is excellent.'Ergo Proxy' is cyberpunk Sci-Fi, i.e. dark dystopian future - High Tech, Low Life. It is gritty, it has action, it has interesting characters and it contains significant psychological and mystery elements. The female lead-character 'Re-L Mayer' is well written: she has a good blend of humanity, brains, and edge. 'Vincent Law,' the male lead-character, is also well developed and complements the other characters.Another selling point for 'Ergo Proxy\": Very Few goofy characters injecting sophomoric humor or otherwise acting very emotional and strange- a couple exceptions, but overall way above average for an anime. Enough said on that score.In closing, if your like me, and you like anime to have a serious edge - i.e. anime that has more sophisticated/ realistic dialogue, animation, plot, and theme - ( ex. Ghost in the Shell, Darker than Black, Mardock Scramble, Claymore, Hellsing) - you will probably like 'Ergo Proxy.'",
        "Ergo Proxy was an animated TV series that had the 23 episodes and was televised on the WOWWOW satellite network between February and August in 2006. This story is one of the most literal productions, and it has a higher rating overseas than Japan since its themes are literal, mythological, and philosophical ones. The characters, various themes that are taken up in each episode, and above all things, the screenplay and the background concepts, go above and beyond their intended purposes, and each permeate into the plot enhancing the themes explored in the anime. As it were, together with the principal axis of the main storyline as a fiction, the foreshadowing based on the solid theme is heavily tinged with.Unknown viruses circulate in the air, the land is reduced to ashes, the sunlight is obscured by dust, and people have to live inside a futuristic domed city called \"Romdo\". The citizens who live peacefully under this total management system keep clinging to the compliant \"fellow citizen\". They coexist AutoReiv, very human-like androids, which perform the duties in which humans are otherwise incapable of. Meanwhile, immigrants are treated as lower classes in Romdo, so they are forced to live their shadowed lives, struggling with becoming the \"fellow citizen\". One day, a virus plaguing androids called \"Cogito\" flourishes in Romdo, and then the infected AutoReiv get out of control burning up or harbouring a human-like emotion. Whilst Re-l, the granddaughter of Donov Mayer who is the Regent of Romdo, investigates the AutoReiv infected by \"Cogito\" virus, she comes across a mysterious monster, the \"Proxy\", in her room like an abandoned building.Vincent Law, an immigrant coming from Mosk, travels with Pino, an infected companion type AutoReiv, after he saved her from being scrapped due to her infection by \"Cogito\". Vincent is falsely charged with a mass murder by the \"Proxy\", and then he escapes to the outside world of the dorm with Pino. Whilst Re-l doubts that there is somehow a relation between Vincent and Proxy, she also goes out of the city following him. The illusory journey to look for the existential reason of \"Proxy\" and Vincent starts...An unexpected ending is led by pursuing, \"What is Proxy\",\"What is the pulse of awakening\", and \"the psychological, philosophical, ideal and mythological keywords which are accumulatively imprinted over the episodes\".The screenplay is stupendously provocative with the great scenario. Also, \"Paranoid Android\" by Radiohead, continues to fascinate the audience whilst sneering for the expansive delusion-ish story, and asking the existential reason of Gods (since there is another interpretation that \"Rain down\" can be deemed as \"Reign (down)\" in the lyrics).",
        "2006 Anime 23 episodes. In a future world where the earth's environment has been decimated, the only living places are enclosed cities which have little to do with each other. In Romdeau city, robots are becoming infected with a virus that makes them self aware and some end up killing humans. Even stranger is a monster that is appearing and chasing a man named Vincent Law. Re-l Mayer is assigned by her authoritarian yet decrepit grandfather and the talking statue leaders to investigate. This series is at times exciting, mysterious, and confusing. Some of the confusion becomes frustrating when it is apparent the writers have the characters be deliberately vague or cryptic with their answers or when explanations are slow in coming. The series slows down towards the end and adds some episodes that are out of character with the series. The final episodes explanations are not believable when you think about it. The main character created the enormous Romdeau city. How exactly?Don't let this review discourage you from watching and enjoying the best parts of Ergo Proxy. It has some very good episodes. Favorite Character: Pino. Irritating characters: everyone else. And what's the deal with the talking statues?",
        "Ergo Proxy is the kind of work that catches us off guard, the less we know of the work the more surprised we are. When I thought about watching it I figured it would be a police investigation anime with the futuristic theme, and I wasn't wrong about that but fortunately it's a lot bigger than that simple premise.The way the anime works philosophy, politics, science and beliefs is very high level, with each episode I was more intrigued by the plot, I had no idea where it was taking me and I think it is very important for the viewer to trust what the series wants to go through and embark on the journey to enjoy the storyI would like to talk a little about the characters, starting with Re-I, at first glance she seems to be the typical badass character, without patience who likes to go straight to her goals, but it is interesting to see with the passage of time that in addition she is also spoiled, annoying and rude, because of the life she had always been flattered, so has trouble understanding that not everything is black and white as she always thought. The anime does not try at any time to give her a reality shock to the point that changes from one day to the next, this change is gradual, the more time she spends with Vincent and Pino the more she understands about aspects of life that she had never realized before, which makes us create affection for the character she becomes at the end of the journey.Speaking of Vincent, I can quietly say that he is one of my favorite characters of all time, a fragile character who was literally thrown into this world with no idea what to do or where to go, at certain times it's as if we were him, lost in this alternate and misrepresented reality. As the plot progresses, it is not a wonder that his character gives meaning to the name of the anime \"Ergo Proxy\" (I think, i soon exist). His search for the reason for existing and who he really is is what moves the plot so peculiarly.And lastly, Pino, who in short is the comic relief of the series, the character for being an android, does not understand anything of the world, whether with regard to the situation or people, and even in serious moments treats everything with a passivity and innocence that ends up making us smile, which makes perfect sense since she was designed to be a child , his innocence is charming. Fortunately the anime not only leaves her in this position of humor but works as well as the previous ones, perhaps Pino's plot is the most emotional of all after being revealed.And this is Ergo Proxy, an anime about finding our reason for existing (raison d'\u00eatre), which we all seek and can identify at some point. All characters, including the most vague are important for work and full of message to pass, all other aspects of the series are also of quality, both artistic and technical. The only thing that can shake a little the experience of those who watch it is its ending that as the anime itself says, \"Deus Ex Machina\".",
        "Ergo Proxy is one of those things (including everything in the world) that will make you go \"What the f**k?\" I want to say this at the very beginning: This show isn't for everyone. If you are a fan of Naruto/Bleach and like mostly action based anime with some or none major questions, you are best far away from Ergo Proxy. Some will say that the show is as slow as the Slowpoke from Pokemon franchise, but it is simply the best way to make these types of show. Just as with Steins;Gate, at the first half you are introduced to at least trillion questions you can't answer. And just when you think you've reached your limits, the answers slowly begin pouring out. And, after all is said and done, you are just sitting there and thinking \"Well ... f**k\". Ergo Proxy is a wonderful masterpiece - from the art, characters, sound and the very story, everything fits extremely well. After re-watching the show, you will actually notice that all of the answers were right in front of you from the very beginning - it is simply due to fact that we rarely pay attention to details during the beginning of a series that you couldn't grasp it all. If you hate shows without 'OMGWTF THEY BLEW UP THE MOUNTAIN WITH JUST WINKING', then you shouldn't watch Ergo Proxy. Despite of its dark nature, gloomy appearance and particularly anguishing revelations, Ergo Proxy brings forth dozes of questions about life, society and the very human nature. It borrows themes from the famous philosophers of the past, brings up the questions that are best avoided and it makes you think - yes, it will make you think. I can't say that everything in this show is perfect - nothing is perfect for perfection does not exist - but this is one hell of a masterpiece. I didn't find it boring - never. Not even during those 'filler' episodes or at its beginning; somehow, I knew everything makes sense even though nothing made sense. There are a lot of questions left unanswered and that is why I'm hoping there will be a second season of this show - if there is, I'll watch it even if I have to move to Japan and learn Japanese language. 10/10.",
        "I have a problem with Ergo Proxy, and it is that I feel that I do not enjoy it. I saw it superficially and I did not get to interpret all its philosophical background that is the main thing in the series.I also felt that the series at times did not know what to do with the story, even so the last episodes are very good and give a good closure to this story that, in another situation, you may enjoy more.\nAlso, pino seems to me an amazing character and this anime is worth watching just for her.",
        "Having watched the whole thing made me instinctively go to the wiki to see what people have pieced together out of this mess.The first few episodes you just don't know what's going on; the middle is where most of the character work happens (and the best part) and the ending is a huge, incoherent exposition dump.",
        "Ergo Proxy is an oddity among it's own genre. It seems, at first glance, like a typical dystopian/cyberpunk series. But the heart of the series is even darker than it's Blade Runner-esquire early episodes suggest. The series focuses on Re-L Mayer, the beautiful, spoiled granddaughter of the head of the city of Romdo. Romdo is a self-sufficient domed city, one of human-kind's last remaining safe havens after a cataclysm makes the outside world unlivable. Re-L is investigating a series of bizarre occurrences, and becomes entangled with Vincent Law, an immigrant who is working to stamp out a virus that causes the normally agreeable android companions of Romdo's citizens to bug out and act on their own free will. Re-L and Vincent both have terrifying encounters with monstrous and mysterious creatures we will come to know as \"Proxies\".Vincent runs afoul of the legal system and is falsely accused of murdering his android companion (or \"entourage\" as they are referred to). Because he is an immigrant he faces grim consequences. With the help of an infected little-girl android named Pino, Vincent escapes the dome, and finds the outside world is not as unsurvivable as he had been led to believe. Re-L eventually sets out to find Vincent and subsequently begins to discover the dark secrets behind Romdo, the Proxies, the androids and even Vincent himself.The series transitions from a fairly standard detective/noir story into a grim and melancholy take on epic fantasy, enveloping those viewers who are willing and patient deep into a world of existential angst. Despite it's intellectual bent, the series finale has a reasonably satisfying emotional payoff.Ergo Proxy's animation is atypical for anime. The characters are rendered in a much more subdued and realistic style and there is beautiful use of rich backgrounds and digital color grading, elevating the series near to the quality of feature length anime. However, there are a few episodes early in the series which are wildly inconsistent in terms of animation quality.The series is mostly leisurely and meditative. There are not many big action set pieces. There is violence and gore, but it's used sparingly and often to greater effect. There is very little humor, and what's there is very dry and quite bleak. There is somewhat of a love story underneath all this, but sex and romance take a backseat, although some episodes play up Re-L's sex appeal. There is a sense of experimentation with several episodes and occasionally the plot thread gets lost when an episode focuses more specifically on the existential angst I mentioned earlier. Sometimes, the series feels overreaching and a little pretentious but it has it's heart in the right place.If you are willing to take the time and invest in this series, Ergo Proxy will reward you. It will challenge you intellectually and occasionally flabbergast you. But it's worth it for the viewer who pays close attention and has some working knowledge of Renee Descartes, Greek myths and progressive rock (trust me, it helps)."

        "I have to say, Greg Ayres can certainly sing and this is my first time hearing him do this. The rest of the English dub cast were quite good as well. The storyline was good but I personally think the songs were really easy to forget, this includes the opening theme song. It wasnt that they were brutal to listen to but I think the way they sounded for me, it seemed there weren't catchy enough to get my attention. Now this is my personal opinon and I could be wrong, but that's how I felt from this anime.its a pity that i didnt think this anime was my taste since it has gotten a lot of postive reviews here. However, I do recommend watching it if you feel you'd like the songs on this anime!",
        "a very solid story about a group of guys wanting to make it as a rock band. Koyuki is the shy, nice kid who befriends the intense, enigmatic Ryuusuke for this purpose. There are other parts of this story which provide, if not comic relief, but a diversion from the actual story. You get to meet a few young girls in Koyuki's wife, including Ryuusuke's rough around the edges but compelling Majo, as well as go through band politics and the struggle to be good. A few parts of this I did not like so much, namely Leon Sykes, whose part in the story is unnecessary. However, they are minor quibbles in a story that manages to entertain greatly. Some profanity, but thats okay. Good music, too. I recommend it as an anime that sometimes feels extremely real.",
        "Based on the manga of the same name written by Harold Sakuishi and written for television by Osamu Kobayashi, Beck: MCS follows 14 year old Koyuki Tanaka as he meets Ray Minami, a former musician and guitarist, leading Koyuki down the road of rock music and stardom. Often a bit of a subdued, slower series, we follow the rise of Koyuki's new band, the troubles it gets into, and the friendships and relationships of all the members. Being a show about music, the music in this is of course great, I don't think I skipped the opening theme a single time over its 26 episode run. And at only a single season with 26 episodes the story is fleshed out and ends well rounded, tying up any threads, and building to a big finale. It was fun watch, and for any fans of anime and alt rock I would highly recommend.",
        "This is my first anime series based on music & slice of life theme, it's the most realistic anime I have seen and I loved it. I had already read the manga it's based on so I had high expectation and still, it was able to deliver. The surprising part was the anime was made in 2005 and it still has an appeal to it. The story revolves around the formation and struggle of a rock band, it takes its time with the process so it does feel slow at times. The main protagonist is a 14-year-old kid, he is an introvert who gets introduced to the rock, we see his growth both as a singer and a guitar player, adding realism to the story is his otherwise everyday life such as him getting bullied at school and such. The other highlight of the anime, his bittersweet love life. In the second half of the story, the involvement of Mafia and goons to control music business did feel a bit overboard, well this is anime and it can only get realistic to a limit. The animation itself was great, very different from what we are used to, the colors used were muted dull & dark, going with the underground music theme. The music is good and does grow on you over time, still other times it felt repetitive. Not sure if it's meant for everyone, but I for one really enjoyed it.",
        "Wow so nostalgic! I first watched this show when I was 13-14yrs old, I haven't thought about it since. All I remembered about it was their was a dog that was all mismatched & it was about a band, I knew I loved it back then but I honestly had no memory of what was so good about it. Well having stumbled upon this hidden gem again I decided I should check it out and see if my judgment would have changed from having seen so many more shows since then. I'm very happy to see that my taste was still good even for this being like the second not main stream anime I've ever seen. The story is pretty straight forward, ordinary bullied kid meets a guitarist by chance. Becomes friends, starts hanging out with him & his band, then decides to pick up guitar. And thus the story unfolds, the life of a struggling band. This shows got tons of action, kick ass music and even a bit of romance. Its pretty solid. My only sorta complaint is that the show is clearly \"finished\" as of the last episode, I would have really liked a second season but tbh I'm not sure they really could have done another season. The animation isn't bad, its not winning any awards but for its time it was definitely pretty good. Now the music is what really makes this show shine, every song is kick ass! No other way to put it, you just want to sit their singing along with the op & ed every single time. The songs the bands play throughout the show are great. I haven't picked up my guitar in years & right in the middle of episodes this show had me wanting to just bust it out and get to practicing! Its pretty inspiring haha. The English dub is really good, all the characters match really well. I'm pretty sure everybody who watches this will like it, make sure you watch at least 3 episodes or so. The beginning might seem a little slow but this is a solid show.4.5/5 Why? Solid story, I only wish we got to take it just a little farther. Animation is pretty good, good for its time. Music is top notch, awesome songs all throughout this show!! Dub is also really good, all the characters match great. If this show doesn't inspire you at least a little then idk your just a miserable person lol.",
        "Boy, i could talk for days and days on end about Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad, but doing a review... that's a bit more of a challenge.Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad is probably one of my favourite anime series. Despite having so many flaws... it's a very slow moving anime, some plot devices get lost, and the instrumentals of the songs sometimes don't match what is being played on the guitar... despite these flaws, i find myself watching Beck, and being in complete awe and amazement at the story of one band's struggle to make it big.I could easily agree, that lovers of rock legends such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and even Radiohead and Rage Against the Machine, will love this anime.One warning though, if you watch this anime, you will most likely want to learn how to play the guitar.",
        "This anime has many, many flaws.But as a musician no anime, tv series or even film has ever portrayed playing in a band as this anime did. I love how real it feels and the struggles the characters face. Obviously there's some spicy stuff added which would never happen in real life, but at its core it stays true to the hard times one has trying to break through as a band.You can see the genuine love for music the people behind this anime in the anime. From the knock-off band shirts, to amazing guitars being shown. The moments that pay respect to the underappreciated members of most bands (the rhythm section) are something that I love dearly as a bassist myself.Again objectively it could be 6 or 7 at best. But because it feels like the story is tailored for me personally and I see the love and effort put into it by its creators I have to give my favourite anime a perfect score.",
        "This is the most impressive anime-movie i've seen in my life. Perfect theme to write the script makes \"Beck\" the best between the youth and new generation of musicians. I've noticed that authors know a lot about rock-stage and music, in fact even about Guitars (Gibson Les Paul, Jaguar and Acoustic Guitars by Martinez are really good). Also they used really good songs, that have given some atmosphere to the project... The script is awesome, just because of its variety of mini-scenes, that makes serial more watchable. You will see romantics, some detective scenes, sports and of cource daily life of Rock Musicians! I've even heard that some people began to play the guitar after watching some series... Heh good luck to them ;)",
        "I love this show so much. I always knew about it, but never give any chance. Now, in the end of 2021 (December 30th), I finished beck and already begin to read the manga. Such brilliant show, characters are so relatable, the romance is very natural and complicated like real life, most teenagers experienced romance like in the show in some degree. The soundtrack is so good, I can't stop listening. The journey to make a band famous is so cool to witness, each time is a different obstacle, but they keep going no matter what. The journey was incredible, I will not forget this show! Beck is unique!By the way, I already bought my guitar!",
        "Beck is overall an entertaining animation by Harold Sakuishi.As everyone has felt and will feel, the story progresses on the slow side. This should not be an issue.There are an array of diverse characters to enjoy throughout the series and much of the character development is done quite well. Or well enough so that you know the role they are suppose to play in the plot.Some of the animation is a little on the skimpy side, but in animation you can play it off as to give the series atmosphere the art was rendered so (but if you read through the original work you can tell the animators for this anime were slacking or you'd question budgeting as the art work in some places drop big in quality). It is nice to see a real place get animated into this work (I.E CBGBs,-I was sad when they shut down-, other venues).Guitar enthusiast, might love or hate the guitars that are show cased in this animation, I for one loved the idea that they used Gretsch (I love this company, sad they were bought out by fender)guitars instead of just sticking with Fenders and Gibsons. Harold Sakuishi also incorporates a \"legendary\" guitar or a well known guitar in the blues world, into the storyline which is entertaining in itself.Music is great. I am a big fan of the Beat Crusaders and they did the most of the major musical work in Beck. The Husking Bees vocalist was used as the main singer, which wasn't too bad. I would venture to say that all the music used are quite \"catchy.\" This is a great story told through a great medium.Also, like one of the other reviewers noted, this anime will make you want to learn the guitar. I agree 100%.",
        "At first I was kind of skeptical about Beck. I saw the opening and later downloaded the mp3 of the opening \"Hit in the USA!\". I passed it up a couple times at my local store, thinking I should wait for a dubbed version, but now I'm glad I didn't. The story of Beck offers a good telling of a junior high school aged boy who finds his passion in music. The kind of music happens to be very good, guitar driven rock. (There's several influences here, Rage against the Machine is very pronounced in some parts, and others will remind you of your favorite rock ballads (new and old)) There is also some romance involved, which will have you yelling at the screen one moment and laughing out loud the next. There's not much more to say without giving the story away so you have to check this series out.",
        "This anime will possibly change your mind. Very delicate.. with a powerful soundtrack!\nEnjoy!",
        "Story: a story about bunch of Japanese teenager make their way to the top as a rock band. unfortunately for them, they make a wrong enemy in the music industries, which make their way narrow and steep. reality bites. talent alone is not enough.. persistence and perseverance are needed. they have to deal with many daily issues like money, school, love life, society acknowledgement, and even personality issue between band members, etc. only their deep passion in music could get them there.thru the obstacle and challenge, better they become as a band, and take them a long way... even a gig in America!a common story for a regular rock band :)dislike :1. the music don't live up to my expectation, mediocre... even quality of the vocalist is so-so (which described to have a very stunning voice). the rap music? argggh.. save me please... actually, the music is not bad.. i kinda like most of it. but (once again) just not good enough to live my expectation... as a very talented rock band. not ROCK'IN enough. ruins the magic of the manga, i think it's better if the manga is left alone without the anime :D2. err yea, the English voice actor is VERY BAD.... so flat... there's no soul in it...likes: 1. the story is about rock music in a real world, no magic/ hocus-pocus music skill. not your average robot/fighting/magic anime 2. have a true passion of the rock music 3. the author have a good music knowledge, to bring you a good experience of a regular band's lifebut overall, i think it's a good anime, worth your time :)",
        "It's a classic story of a young group forming a band and wanting fame.But it's much more. The music is great and the characters are very likable.It's also an interesting look at the life of a teenager fitting into his culture/social environment in Japan.When I was in my teens I had a dream of being in a successful band, and now being close to 50 BECK is a fun flashback as to what it might be like.The pace of the series is slow, the story could have been told easily in half the number of episodes. it may take 5 or 6 to get you hooked. But the slow pace really adds to the texture of the story.I do hope a DVD of the series is planned.As a life long resident of Seattle the final episode is a real treat.",
        "I don't know if 9/10 it's too much, but I don't really care about that. I started watching Beck because I was getting into rock and learning how to play electric guitar, so I decided that watching an anime related to a rock band would be a great idea... And it was. From all the anime lists related to rock bands, Beck was the only one that could show amazing rock soundtracks that makes us want Beck to really exist, and how life is hard for every one, and that real fame is something not easy to get. I love the story, it's the same world as ours, there are lots of references to popular bands like Rage Against The Machine and the Beatles (so in the end it also adds more knowledge to the viewer that knew little about rock history). In the manga and movie there are no vocals so it's always great to hear the main character sing in the anime. The characters are full of emotions and each struggles with something different but in the end all want the same... \"To be an hit in America\". And this series just show why Rock is the genre of music with the best back story ever, full of legends. But the most important thing to me is that every time I was giving up at learning the guitar I watched an episode of Beck, and after watching it my motivation would rise like a Phoenix. This is why Beck will be a legendary series, because it has a great story, but above all it gives us motivation to become great musicians.",
        "Based on a manga of the same this anime is all about Tanaka Yukio, better known by his nickname Koyuki is a 14 year old who feels disconnected from life in general. Through the act of saving a mismatched dog, he meets guitarist Minami Ryuusuke, and becomes involved in Ryuusuke's new band BECK. Koyuki's life starts to change as the band struggles towards fame.Along the way he encounters many awkward and new situations, things he has never had to deal with before. If you've ever gone through things similar to what he's gone through, you'll immediately connect with this anime.Beck relies heavily on this connection with it's viewers, so if you do not make the connection, you will probably not like the anime. It's not the standard slasher series, and focuses much on the viewers emotion.So if you like music (Has an awesome rock soundtrack so good I even imported it) and storyline and want a break from the overplayed bloodshed scenario, this anime is for you"

    "MAJOR": [
        "After the departure of Brenda Leigh Johnson, Sharon Raydor (Mary McDonnell) takes over the Major Crimes unit in the LAPD. It's the TNT spin-off of the TV show, The Closer. She takes an interest in street kid Rusty Beck who witnessed a crime committed by serial killer Phillip Stroh. The group from The Closer is maintained. It's essentially the same show with a different lead. The addition of Rusty brings a different tone to the chemistry. Often, the serial killer overlay is disruptive to these types of police procedurals. The difference is that Billy Burke is a really compelling actor and he's not the common masked unknown killer. Mary McDonnell is solid as a replacement. It's simply a very functional police drama. The last season is more binge-worthy as it consists of three multi-episode stories. Provenza continues to be the fun comedic side although Flynn's domestication has tamed his character. I wonder if there will be a third incarnation of the franchise. That would be nice.",
        "I've got to admit I will miss Kyra Sedgwick, but for the past couple of years Mary McDonnell has been honing and refining her character of Captain Sharon Raydor so that we are familiar with her. As Sedgwick left the LAPD, McDonnell was poised to take over.I do love Captain Raydor, she stays in control no matter what, completely unlike Brenda Lee Johnson who occasionally liked to cowgirl it up and cut a few corners in the pursuit of justice. Cutting a few too many corners is what forced her to leave. Raydor will never cut corners, she's all about the rules.Like Sedgwick this first season and probably for some time after that McDonnell will be gradually winning over, Tao, Flynn, Sanchez and Provenza,those who hold over from Brenda Lee's crew. Brenda Lee's crew took a long time to warm up to her and even though McDonnell rose from the ranks, the squad views her still as the woman who was investigating their methods from The Closer.I'm not sure that bringing in Graham Patrick Martin a street kid who was a material witness to a murder left over from the last episode of The Closer is a good fit. Clearly he's brought in for two reasons, to get a younger audience watching the show and to develop a personal life for Captain Raydor. She's got two grown children and I'm sure they'll visit from time to time which will provide plots for future episodes.I like what Mary McDonnell does with her character of Captain Raydor and I hope the show lasts.",

Raydor/MaryMcDonnell is a single-minded head and stubborn in her pursuit of suspects and the truth . She believes in being thoroughly prepared and knowing more than the suspect in an interrogation . She is a well trained interrogator and has a great ability to get confessions . Sharon well played by Mary McDonnell who is introduced to the Priority Homicide Division universe as the Captain of the Force Investigation Division , taking over the renamed PHD , which looks into officer-involved shootings , including one involving Detective David Gabriel .

She and Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson are initially antagonistic , although each is very dedicated to her job and believes in following the truth . Subsequently Raynor commands Major Crimes . She adopts a problematic teen called Rusty Beck/Graham Patrick Martin who causes a lot of troubles . The team is formed by a motley group , most of them are politically incorrect , chauvinistic , protesters , likable , but also hard-working and intelligent police inspectors .it is formed by the following members : 1- G.

He is of Chinese descent and his wife Kathy is Japanese . They have a teenage son . Before being transferred to Priority Homicide , Tao was a member of the SID . He is a true geek and loves to explain the science behind everything, even when a short answer will do . 4- Raymond Cruz is good as Detective Julio Sanchez , he is an important member of the Priority Homicide Division , later being called Major Crimes under direction of Capt. Raydor. He is a widower and an expert on Latino gangs . He has a quick temper and often plays the \"bad cop\" in interrogations, getting in a suspects face or threatening violence .

Keene plays as Buzz Watson , he is a Civilian Service Coordinator who provides technical support to the Los Angeles Police Department's Priority Homicide Divisi\u00f3n .

Taylor loves addressing the media . He encourages people in his squad to continue their education . 7- Jonathan Del Arco plays Dr. Morales , Deputy Medical Examiner for the Los Angeles County Department of the Coroner .

He is openly gay and sometimes serves as a resource on the gay community. 8- John Tenney interprets well as Fritz Howard who is a special agent with the FBI and is part of the Crimes Unit in Los Angeles . He knows Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson/Sedgwick from when they both lived and worked in law enforcement in Washington D.C. He has been in L.A. for three years when the series begins and has a sister, Claire, who believes she is psychic. He knows about Will Pope and is uncomfortable around him .",
        "I loved The Closer. Major Crimes is almost as good. The only thing missing is Kyra Sedgwick as Brenda, who was so fantastic.The energy is different now, with the less volatile Captain Raydor taking over. Refined and soft spoken, she runs the department with a velvet glove. Mary McDonnell is a fine actress that I've admired for years, so it's good to see her all the time.There are a couple of things about this show that make it a cut above the norm. First, the ensemble cast is one of the best around, almost on a par with NCIS, with plenty of banter and strong working relationships.The other thing is the follow-through from The Closer. Jon Tenney is still around as FBI agent Fritz, Brenda's husband. He mentions Brenda all the time, and people in the department ask him to say hello to her - in other words, it's all normal. So often in shows, a spin off never mentions the previous characters again. I just wish she'd make a guest appearance. I am still getting caught up on episodes, so I'll keep hoping.I notice reviews on this board don't think much of Rusty. I guess he was thrown in to give McDonnell's character more background and more warmth than she had when she was driving Brenda crazy. I don't mind him. Is there a little too much emphasis on him? Probably. But for me it doesn't detract from the show. And I liked the addition of Tom Berenger as Raydor's husband, from whom she has been long separated. Berenger has certainly changed a lot -- when I was a youngster, he was compared to Paul Newman in the looks department and was the next hot guy. Well, age happens to all of us.Flynn, Provenza, Tao, Sanchez, Sykes, all do a wonderful job and keep the show both humorous and dramatic. Robert Gossett, now Assistant Chief Taylor, is very good, as is Jonathan Del Arco as the relaxed, tell-it-like-it-is coroner. Different DDAs pass through, some more difficult than others, but all solid.Really love the show and hope it keeps running.",
        "Continuing a popular television series such as The Closer with a powerful headliner like Kyra Sedgwick is a tricky risk. But in the case of MAJOR CRIMES that risk was most assuredly worth taking. Even in the final episodes of The Closer the new leader of the police group was introduced and the adjustment by the staff was shared with the viewers - a smart factor in adjusting to a new start.So now Captain Sharon Raydor, portrayed but the cool, assured, soft spoken Mary McDonnell steps in to guide the cast of characters well known and loved by viewers - from the crusty to the feisty and the devoted including G.W. Bailey, Tony Denison, Michael Paul Chan, Raymond Cruz, Phillip P. Keene, Erin Cummings, Samantha Cutaran, Kearran Giovanni, Robert Gossett et al. One character introduced in the final episodes of The Closer as a troubled kid - Rusty Beck (Graham Patrick Martin) - provides not only a sense of continuity that made The Closer so compelling, but his presence as the waif for whom Captain Raydor agrees to provide foster care allows us to see both the tender side of this somewhat enigmatically distant woman while offering some solid psychological coaching for Rusty that shows us more strongly how she has sculpted her role and serves in her lead role as head decision maker of her squad. The manner in which she manages the ongoing story of Rusty who is contacted by his estranged biological father Daniel Dunn (Ian Bohen) is particularly well handled by every member of the cast, proving that this first class squad of policemen/women have a lot more going for them than just the usual point and shoot! MAJOR CRIMES is a successful series, a fact honoring all who made The Closer a special program. Welcome to Mary McDonnell. The shoes fit very well! Grady Harp",
        "THE CLOSER, let's be frank and give it credit, was a phenom.Like other rock-solid shows (CSI VEGAS and Miami come to mind) it is almost timeless. If you should ever end up on a deserted island (whether by choice as part of a reality show, or accidentally) you could do worse than have the complete set of CLOSER episodes to watch.Sedgwick's role in making CLOSER work was unusual even by TV standards. She was of course the \"star,\" but she was also the \"glue\", ie, the presence that kept the episodes working from scene to scene.In most shows the star is NOT the glue. That Kyra was able to carry a dual burden is a testament to her talent.Which brings us to this forced spin off, where, clearly, the producers looked at a bunch of broken eggs and decided to make an omelet.McDonnell has both charisma and talent (Dances with Wolves, BSG) but her power in the original Closer was as a foil to Sedgwick. On screen, they created sparks. By herself, she is a little lost.They are trying to give the rest of the cast more dialog and more personality. Doesn't work. G.W. Bailey for example was a character actor for years and was fine on Closer. On Major Crimes, he punches each line of dialog like a young George Foreman but to no avail.And the writer's attempts to differentiate the shows by making the theme in the spin off about \"cutting deals\" -- that's just wrong.I don't expect the fans to agree but I calls em as I sees em. One of the worst spinoffs ever.",
        "It is not very often where you have one crime TV series cancelled only to be replaced with many of the original cast members but excluding the major star (Kyra Sedgwick) of the original crime series and to have such an enduring presence for years to come.I must say that week in and week out Major Crimes generated a suspenseful and entertaining crime program in which each of the detectives and their new leader Captain Sharon Raydor (Mary McDonnell) all played significant and independent thinking detectives with an eclectic personality. Mrs. Shullivan and I have discussed this TV series on many occasions and we both agree that theirs is an all star cast, second to none.If I had to pick a single favorite detective I just could not. If I had to pick a favorite episode from the series 105 episodes spanning six (6) seasons I just could not. I will however say that the Major Crimes unit were all unique personalities and during each episode I just was never sure what to expect, which detective(s) would leave us with an inspiring ending, with a humanistic approach to crime solving because there were just far too many great stories to choose from.This group of detectives especially Captain Raydor whose husband Jackson Raydor (Tom Berenger), she was seperated from due to his drinking and gambling problems as well as just not being a good husband and/or father to their two (2) now adult children. Unlike many TV series the producers allowed the audience to recognize that Captain Raydor was a devout Catholic by religious faith, but always struggled with her decisions amongst her family members (divorce isa dirty word for Captain Raydor) including the adoption of a near adult named Rusty who was under her direct witness protection in a murder case, as well as in her methods of capturing the criminals.I must say that the \"like father and son\" relationship that the curmudgeonly detective Louie Provenza (G.W. Bailey) and the 17 year old witness under police protection Rusty Beck (Graham Patrick Martin) shareded was very endearing. The emotional and \"take no prisoners\" approach that the tough as nails, wild eyed detective Julio Sanchez (Raymond Cruz) displayed was also one of my favorites. But having said that, each of the detectives including detective Mike Tao (Michael Paul Chan) their technical data guru, detective Amy Sykes (Kearran Giovanni) with her military surveillance background, recovering alcoholic detective Andy Flynn (Tony Denison) who followed his captain Raydor around like a love lost puppy dog, and their videographer Buzz Watson (Phillip P. Keene) all were such interesting characters. All the supporting cast such as the police chief, deputy district attorney and coroner played key roles a well.Without question though this series is rated a 10 due mainly to the high quality team of the series writers who are far too many to mention and the show creator James Duff who also created the predecessor crime series \"The Closer\".I give this series a perfect 10 out of 10 with such an amazing cast from book-end to book-end and without failure, a suspenseful and dramatic series with superior quality writing throughout the series lifespan of an amazing 105 episodes. I will definitely be looking to purchase this \"complete series\" when it becomes available to purchase.",
        "This show... what do the writers love about Rusty? He's an annoying whiny brat and I was unaware that a child (what he was when the show started) had such access to a police station? Mary McDonnell was way better on Galactica. Here she kisses this punks butt which I'd understand if she were single, but she has kids of her own already. The show kept most of the cream of the crop from The Closer, Provenza, Flynn, Tao and Buzz, but not the compelling story lines. If I were Taylor, after listening to McDonnell's unemotional and Rusty's over emotional deliveries, I'd want to be killed off the show too. Rusty's 'relationship' with Gus, whose really a creep, goes on way too long and way too far. And can people simply walk in an out of any police station in LA? No pass or anything? Stroh had the same problem as Hannibal Lector. If he's so damn smart how does he finally get killed... by RUSTY? Really? Are you kidding me here? The Closer was way better and I think Kyra left because she saw it was going to become the Rusty show. Also, what's with killing off so many of the cast in the last few episodes? Strange way to end a series. They should have dumped Rusty and Raydor quickly and made it the Provenza show.",
        "This spin-off is getting off to a great start. Most of Brenda's crew remains in Major Crimes and as to be expected doesn't warm up to Captain \"by the book\" Raydor, to say the least. I like the Raydor character and McDonnell's deadpan delivery style which often results in pithy and/or humorous observations. Like when she says to Provenza, in the second episode, something like \"Why don't you stay with the department until you find a job where everything is always fair.\" This was not said sarcastically but ruefully for she has just been cheated out of a promotion - so no, life in the workplace is not always fair. McDonnell's character is so different from Sedgwick's - and this is good because they're both interesting. It's great that so many of the cast from The Closer moved over to the new show (Corey Reynolds' character didn't but Gabriel was my least favorite character so that's okay with me; besides given the attitude of a couple of the team members towards him, it would have made no sense to keep Gabriel in the Major Crimes department). I'm not too taken with the material witness kid yet but maybe he'll get a little less annoying. I liked the first episode of Major Crimes as much as I liked the first episode of The Closer. Here's hoping it will last as long.",
        "This series struggled to keep my attention after the fourth season. It seems most of the actors got their jobs because of their looks and certainly not their acting ability. Admittedly some of them do feel like legit cops such as Sharon, Louis who is the old man with the put on voice like someones drunk uncle trying to be like Caruso in CSI Miami and the over acting that is Julio Sanchez.Originally it was ok, nothing ground breaking. Everyone accepts things too quickly such as Sharon's biological children accepting Rusty after having one or two things to say back and forth. But by the fourth season Rusty had almost nothing to add to the story. They just put him in his little suits like a dollar store version of Neil Patrick Harris without the humor or likability. I was so glad when he got a different haircut that didn't make him look like a Back Street Boy reject. However to a degree what was going on with the LAPD and their pet Rusty which was really hard to believe someones \"son\" could be allowed in the police station the way he is. Even doing homework where Buzz (the tech support) was helping him instead of focusing on crimes. Yet somehow it revolved around the story. By the 6th season it finally started to have cliff hangers and everything. However I feel the actor who played Andy Flynn and Sharon had no chemistry. Granted it's not an A list show and hardly anyone remembers this but I just shuddered. Thankfully the show wasn't \"woke\" or \"preachy\" yet the cast is surprisingly multicultural. At least Amy and Camilla were easy on the eyes compared to this one woman around season 5 and it surprised me that Nadine Velazquez who was in My Name Is Earl among other shows was in this.Mary McDonnel can't act to save her life. It's like the South Park episode where the boys are diagnosed with ADD and want to see Phil Collins. That level of enthusiasm! I often try to imitate Mary in this show how iconic her bad acting is. The few times she shouts or puts even a slight bit of effort to earn her pay it just comes off as hilarious. She is so monotone and stiff it's unbelievable she got the role. Sure she looks the part but when she opens her mouth it astonishes me anyone would hire her. She reminds me of in a Steven Seagal tv series True Justice which is not to be confused with his reality show in Louisiana. The pretty blonde woman Sarah. Of the two which should would I slog through again if I was on an island and would not get rescued for 2 weeks? True Justice. Mary is easier on the eyes especially when she was younger before this show as she was about 60 in this but Steven takes my vote as his silliness and over the top makes it a winner. This is one of those awful shows you watch between good shows waiting for new stuff to be produced. Either way skip this show.",
        "I thought I was a Mary McDonnell fan but the more I see of her the less I want to see of her. Her acting is flat and dry and unconvincing. She's poorly cast in this role. The rest of the team are good actors well cast, except for one irritating exception. The plots and production values are good. So why three stars?Wesley Crusher. I mean, Rusty. It's the annoying disposable teenager interrupting adults doing interesting things problem from Star Trek all over again. The kid shouldn't be in the room. Why are we subjected to him. After a while I started fast forwarding any scene with him, because the plot is on hold anytime he is on screen.Seven stars for the cast. Minus three stars for Ensign Rusty. Minus one star for Mary McDonnell. Three stars.",
        "The ensemble cast of the Closer carries over to Major Crimes.The lead character changes over, but the general feel is more of a group/ensemble cast than in The Clooser.As in The Closer, the plots/scripts remain brisk, the acting is excellent, and this is a procedural of the first rank.Excellent, highly recommended.",
        "ha ha ha! I came here to check to see if maybe they've finally killed him off. I LOVE the show but had to stop watching' cause I absolutely cannot stand him. So I checked the reviews (as I do periodically) chronologically and look what I found right off (from rosig- 55535 from Canada):'The Rusty character has high jacked the show; a kidnapping has occurred. The story line is awful, the incessant whining is infuriating and his acting is awful . . .May I ask if others feel the same way? I have seen other sites where the primary write-ups are virtually all \"negative\" Rusty based. Do the producers and writers not read these. The minute I see him come into a shot I fast forward. Not fun at all.'YES! others feel the SAME WAY!I feel EXACTLY the same way. PLEASE get rid of this guy. I WANT to watch the show and can't.Update. Season 5, Episode 1: So . . . SPOILER ALERT . . . SPOILER ALERT . . . SPOILER ALERT . . . Rusty is now gay. Watching the show I am reminded that I truly enjoy it. Rusty at least looks a little better. Still sets my teeth on edge, but I fast-forwarded through his scenes and I really enjoyed the other parts of the show . . . SPOILER ALERT . . . he'll be moving out and somebody else will be moving in, so maybe he'll slowly ride off into the setting sun. LOVE the show . . . PLEASE get rid of Rusty once and for all. Some kind of tragic accident. Or a murder . . . !Sigh . . . episode 10ish . . . they're keeping him. I give up. I just hate even seeing Graham Patrick Martin in the frame. Sorry Provenza and Sanchez, funny as you all are I give up. Good-bye.",
        "This series has had its moments. Like many of those who watch this show. I've been watching since the first episode of \"The Closer\". And since that show was so good. Major Crimes was bound to succeed, since they kept the original cast nearly completely intact. And while this episode is well written and well acted. It suffers from the same problems that most of the offerings from Hollywood in last 20 to 25 years. A lack of back guys. This is the middle episode of three that involves one of few villains left to writers and producers these days racists. And not just any racist. These are Nazi's. And they'rea large group of people who are aggressively breaking laws all over LA. And openly showing civil disobedience in demonstrations. Something Nazi's rarely do. This is like the movies where racists, businessmen, and the American Government are the only enemies of peace and freedom. Major Crimes does not present even a slightly realistic look at crime and law enforcement in the city of Los Angeles. Or anywhere else for that matter. I still watch it because most of the main (original) characters are endearing and fun to see woven into most of the story lines. Hardly a week goes by where it doesn't seem that the content came directly from a place with a name like \"The Ministry of Propaganda\".",
        "This is a case of terrible decision making, getting rid of Kyra Sedgwick was bad enough but getting rid of Corey Renolds in the same swoop? Here's the problem while the cast is still pretty good the show has lost all of its drive. The main actors put those elements in place, and after watching the first episode I just don't see it. Having said that the show itself is pretty much the same as it always was, there are bad guys who kill people. Then major crimes is sent to investigate, some banter ensues at the crime scenes but the missing element is the interrogation. That has somehow taken a backseat in this show which was the most focused element in the closer. So we shall have to see how that pans out, although if the first episode is any indicator not too great. 7/10 wait and see.",
        "This derivative, unlikely, ham-handed, illogical piece of breaking-no-new- ground television is why I have never owned a television in my adult life. I assume this was on one of the \"big \"networks as it is so awful. I watch all my television either free via streaming or on DVDs from the library. I only made it through one DVD. I don't know what else to say. The characters are shallow, one-dimensional, old school. If you have a smart grandmother who reads books, and a really stupid grandmother, your stupid grandmother might like this. That's the best thing I can say about it.",
        "My wife and I were big fans of The Closer so when it went off the air we gave Major Crimes a chance. I'm still not a huge fan of Mary MCDonnell but she's alright. The rest of the old cast that made it through to Major Crimes is just great, and the few additions are fine as well. But we just can't stand the Rusty character.For us the Rusty character ruins the flow of the show. We enjoy one Major Crime per episode and find the Rusty story to be a disturbing diversion from what is going on in each episode. It was okay for four or five episodes but it should have been killed a long time ago.We don't feel the Rusty character adds anything to the show, on the contrary we are bothered every time he shows up. I'm sure the actor Graham Patrick Martin is fine, its just the character we don't like. I'm getting more and more irritated by Rusty every episode.Every time the Rusty character shows up we go into smartphone mode with one eye on the screen to see when we should refix our attention on Major Crimes instead of the weather, email, Facebook, or news on our phones.Please Please Please lose the Rusty character and don't replace that character with another side story.",
        "Thanks to the marvel of streaming I had the opportunity recently to re-watch The Closer and appreciate how good it was, apart from the somewhat disjointed final season, so I thought I'd give Major Crimes a go. Now it's not a disaster but neither does it reach the regular heights of The Closer and after 3 seasons I had to give it up. On the plus side the team has much more to do and is not trailing around after the bosses coat tails as they tended to be in The Closer; G. W. Bailey as Provenca leads the squad as he would do and the character and the episodes benefit from it, also Raymond Cruz as Sanchez has more to do and his flaws are well played, the introduction of new girl Sykes played by Kearran Giovanni works and isn't just an inclusion tick box exercise. The negative side however outweighs the positive; the most obvious is Rusty Beck probably the most annoying character ever played in a police procedural drama and after 3 seasons I still couldn't work out whether that was because Graham Patrick Martin is a poor actor or the script he was given was written by someone with no clue about teenagers/young males; much ink has been spilt about how annoying the character is but of far more importance is the ridiculousness of his involvement in every single episode where his 'drama' distracts the viewer from enjoying the episode and the absolute unrealistic character arc of having Captain Raydor as his legal guardian and then being adopted by her as if by magic with no repercussions - watch the adoption episode and ask yourself just how creepy the whole damm thing is. Which brings us neatly to the next big negative and that is Mary McDonnell as Captain Raydor; this character worked well enough as a foil to Brenda Johnson and as an ally in the final series of The Closer but that character in charge of an elite squad of detectives just does not fly and as the series goes on her criminal insights become increasingly farcical. This is not helped by McDonnell's performance which is largely given in a flat monotone and the 'emotional' scenes are false and unbelievable; maybe the unfortunate resorting to botox and the such which seems to be the go to for older actresses accounts for the lack of facial expression, who knows. There are other problems, the super villain status afforded Phillip Stroh, the cringeworthy 'comedy' episodes and the nonsense of a Captain ordering around completely independent departments of the (squeaky clean) LAPD like SIS and SOB but ultimately I couldn't take any more of the Rusty Beck/Sharon Raydor love in so be warned.",
        "The characters already created in a show that I found to be quite excellent with Kyra Sedgwick still has those characters I really like. I find it very odd and distracting that there are so many scenes which contain nearly all the characters. It is difficult to imagine that in police work you would ever find so many on a case. It is especially distracting with so many in a room, some staring at computer screens, all standing and facing the camera so they can easily be filmed. It's almost as if it was prearranged they would all get near equal screen time. There is no comparing Kyra and Mary McDonnell. Perhaps she has had so much botox she can't make but one expression. Kyra Sedgewick has the unusual skill of almost limitless numbers of facial expressions and almost contortions. Whatever the script, Kyra has been the master of it in The Closer. I also agree with many reviewers that Rusty is far too involved in the series. I have never seen any other series where a young actor/character appears as much as he does! He's very handsome and a pretty good actor. I just don't know why he is such a large part of the series. I do enjoy the further development of the characters who remained with the series, as well as new characters. So I enjoy the series even though I can't ignore the flaws.",
        "\"The Closer\" had the insuperable advantage of being centred on an unforgettable character played brilliantly. But Major Crimes falls down not only in this but in so many departments -- slow pacing, exceptionally weak jokes with bad comic timing, unimaginative camera set-ups, generally poor writing and directing. Until now I have only caught snippets of the show and it could never hold my attention longer than 10 minutes at the outside. This evening I stumbled on a Christmas episode about a Santa killed in a bank robbery, and I gave it around 20 minutes in hopes. I don't know if the commander's family of teenagers are a regular feature but they made the whole thing far worse, as just a diversion from the crime story, and a specially uninteresting one at that. \"Criminal Minds\" used to strike me as ludicrous when they often had a group scene and everyone has to have a line to say -- like \"Scooby Doo\" but without the supposed cuteness. This episode of \"Major Crimes\" was worse because there were scenes with up to 10 people, all having their turn to say something (which usually amounted to nothing).",
        "It's best to watch The Closer first then Major Crimes. It's not a requirement just a suggestion.\nMostly because some of the jokes and/or comments will make more sense. Plus you'll understand their special division, the characters quirky nuances and about those in charge.\n> I wasn't sure how the show was gonna feel without Chief Johnson in charge and her talent/tactics with getting the suspects to talk. But it seemed almost the same. Captain Raydor is in charge and her character is toned way down from the internal affairs version of her character from the early days. She is much more likeable and caring and gets the job done and the team eventually rallies behind her.\nBasically, it's almost exactly like The Closer, with a few changes that after a few episodes you don't even realize anything is different.\nRusty can seem kinda annoying at times early on but it gets better as it goes.",
        "I watched a few episodes of this series, with high hopes for its success, but it was not to be.Those members of the cast who are holdovers from The Closer do their best, but without the character of Brenda Leigh Johnson to bounce off of, there just isn't any chemistry.Capt. Raydor has a face of stone, and displays no emotion at all. One has to wonder if she is capable of expressing emotion? Kyra Sedgwick was smart to quit while she was ahead. The Closer was one of the best-written series to ever grace the tube, but this spin-off, continuation, or whatever you call it is a dud.",
        "I cannot believe how much every one hates Rusty.He was a material witness to a crime. That is why he was at the station all the time.Then became the son of the commander - the boss.He was suppose to be annoying.. He was 16. And when the show ended it was 6 years later. He grew up and his character grew as well.He was very annoying when he was first introduced. But he grew up and became a ADA because of Philip Stroh.Overall, I loved this show and so did millions of other people.",
        "Mary you did wonderfully but no.....just.....no. Like rubbing salt into a wound seeing more of Rayder after the removal of Brenda. There are few less enjoyable to watch characters on tv. She plays the bad guy so well, its unshakable and feels like a real foist into this show. Provenza got robbed just sayin!",
        "Like almost everyone, I came to major crimes from the closer, big fan. I had no real expectations. in my mind it was yet another spin off. I actually liked major crimes even more than the closer. both were excellent. with closer, as much as I loved 'brenda', i got tired of that fake southern accent, they had WAY too much of her parents, and because of the focus on her family life, there was not as much focus on the squad at the precinct.\nMajor crimes really let tao, and provenza and flynn blossom. and, gotta say it, i love sykes. so for those who have just finished the closer and cannot decide if you should go for major crimes, I highly recommend it.\nre: other criticisms:\nmany have written that they could not stand rusty and he had too much attention. i understand that. perhaps they over did it with him especially his love life. but he did play an important role. they needed something that the closer did not have, some conduit between home and work.\nre: Sharon.... I really don't understand what some have said about her. she is every bit the equal of Brenda. they were an even exchange, both great stong female characters.\nfinal thing without giving out any spoilers, at the end, yes, S6 got a little obvious, but eery show really does when they know it is the end. sopranos, breaking bad, mad men, all had the same issue. i totally figured out the end of the arcs in s6, but that really doesn't make it bad. enjoy."

The two are also next door neighbours and inevitably they gradually become friends. Soon after becoming friends they discover that each of them secretly fancies the other's best friend.This series is a real delight. It has elements of comedy and drama but ultimately it is all about the characters. The two leads are fun to watch and so are the secondary characters; particularly their aforementioned best friends; a young model who joins their class and Ryuji's mother. The humour never feels overly forced and the characters are believable. Over the course of the series we see various highs and lows for the characters as they interact and do the sort of things high schoolers do in anime. The animation is decent and the character designs are good. Overall I'd recommend this to all anime fans looking for an enjoyable little story, great characters you care about and emotional moments.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
        "Usually I don't go for romance anime, let alone school life ones. But this one was interestingly good. The main positive of this one was the two main characters. These two were so different and yet they had great dynamics that made the anime entertaining and produced some funny moments. The romance story, however, was a little weak, though I personally didn't mind that much. But, because the last episodes were dedicated to the love story and they were kind of tiring, it has to be mentioned. Moreover, the art was okay, could have been better though. Finally, the soundtrack was nice and cute enough for the concept of the anime. So, 7 out of 10.",
        "I really liked the two main characters Ryuji and Tiaga because they pretty much matched well. I kinda feel sorry for Ryuji because he doesn't have a bright mother, his father left the family and the fact for what he looks like, people just tries to stay away from him. Add to that, he always gets beaten up by Tiaga haha. Although as the series went on, they ended up being friends and became a couple (I guess?).Really likeable anime to sit back and put your feet up! I'll give it 8/10!",
        "I went into this show with relatively high expectations. Based on the way that people talk about this show, I was expecting some kind of masterpieces. I will give it this, the animation and visuals are good, and I like the theme song. My compliments end there as episode one of this show is so uninteresting that there is almost nothing to talk about. The start of this show is mostly boring filler and while the art is good, nothing that is being shown is actually visually interesting. Maybe later episodes are fascinating or something, but I have little tolerance for shows that start off so boring and bland.",
        "It's simply amazing!\nThe way it faces with characters' emotions and personalities is simply amazing! You'll be completely captured by the story from the beginning.\nIt is mainly about love story but has also a lot of funny, sentimental, deep scenes. I cried. This anime can shake your feelings like only Japanese's stuff can do (well, in my opinion).\nThe animation is also very well done. I love these drawings.I recommend it to everyone and in particular to everyone that loves romance, sentimental or slice of life things!",
        "Rating: 8.0Favorite Episode: DoshitatteActually really engaging slice of life. It has a few logical holes and I didn't like the end pairing but it's not far off from how highs-schoolers really behave.",
        "There is a bit of bait and switch in this anime. The first two episodes play with your expectations setting you up with a light-hearted rom-com and cliched side characters.Then it turns around and adds layers to said characters, good writing that mocks anime cliches, arcs that force character development.It does drag in the middle with all the drama but it's the somehow rushed and forced ending after that that lowers it's rating for me.Make no mistake, this one set the standards for romance anime going forward and with good reason. A must see and never forget anime.",
        "It's your typical \"Will They Won't They\" for the majority of the episodes, and by \"They\", I mean everybody. It's not a love triangle, it's a love circle, and that's probably one of the things that make Toradora! so entertaining and fun to watch.Toradora! does fall in its genre's tropes sometimes, and there are times when things get a little bit too predictable story-wise. But in the end, I felt like there were a lot of things that it did right, and the story was overall satisfying.",
        "Yes, it's another teen coming of age / \"slice of life\" anime, it has many of the classic character stereotypes represented, and yes many of the classic tropes are represented, but unlike so many others it's well done.What surprised me is how naturally the series develops.The characters are simple but not one dimensional, depth is obtained through flawed but very human choices and the consequences of them.\nTropes are present but instead of being shoehorned in they exist as integral parts of the story, often noticed after the fact instead of standing out like the \"fan-service\" we've come to expect (and often dread).\nEpisodes flow well, without the gaps and jumps I've grown to expect and when the end is reached it felt natural.It would be easy to go on, but in the end it's an enjoyable series that makes me interested in taking a second look at the \"Slice of Life\" genre.Pro's:\nQuality story telling.Fairly consistent animation.Characters that feel natural.A compete story arc.Good depth and growth.Con's:\nSome animation inconsistencies at the end.Ending arc could have used another episode.Some over the top silliness.Fairly predictable (still very enjoyable).",
        "\"Since the ancient times, it has been decided that only dragons are worthy of standing next to tigers.\" The relationship between the two main character is almost identical to \"Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi\". Aisaka Taiga (AKA \"Tiny Tiger\") basically abuses and bosses around Takasu Ryuuji (\"Ryuu\" is dragon). And just as Haruhi series, she eventually falls for the guy.I really enjoyed the Haruhi series, but this series was even better. The characters were very interesting and developed extremely well. Even the supporting characters had great depth.I've always found it difficult to cry in anime compared to live-action because let's face it, they're just drawings. But I really connected with the main characters in this series and the scenarios really touched me. This is probably the first TV anime series where I actually cried.Unlike the pure conclusion-per-episode format of Haruhi series, \"Toradora!\" had somewhat more continuity between episodes and therefore characters developed much better. Music was exceptionally well-made and touching, and although the quality of animation was average, the character design was really well done and memorable.Although \"Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi\" was more of a fantasy and \"Toradora!\" being coming-of-age school romance, I thought they were very similar and \"Toradora!\" was superior in every way. The previous reviewer says this is \"The greatest anime i have ever seen\", it is for me as well, and I have enjoyed every moment of it. Highly recommended.",
        "The first and the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. A love story, of true and young feelings. The first time I saw the series was a couple of years ago, together with my family. We were very attached to this anime. In this last period I have reviewed the whole series with great pleasure. I love Toradora! The soundtrack is also pleasant. An anime to see absolutely that you are passionate about and makes you fall in love... Is a pity that the series ends, the end warms the heart. Sincere love will win and fate will be fulfilled. Love and friendship always win.",
        "It is very difficult to put this anime into words, it brings so much to the table. The name Toradora is off putting - but it is made clear - its the union of a tiger and dragon - and just this concept is wonderful when you watch the outplay of this wonderful anime.I am trying to describe what I felt for Toradora and it is really confuses me - as it is so emotional. It was such a beautiful and sad trip at the same time that it left me with a warm feeling of having seen a story that caught me from beginning to end. I know that Toradora may seem to some the development of a toxic story and it may be true, but you have to look beyond that. It is, for me, a story of unions, of fitting in somewhere, of belonging, of learning to feel important for others and for others, a story that is and will be precious to me.Beautiful, sheer joy and sorrow.",
        "I can usually find lots of things to complain about in everything I watch, but toradora gives me very few. There is more than one person who likes the main character, but you always know who he will actually end up with so that doesn't matter as much. The girl is a tsundere, but they become friends quickly and that doesn't impose on the story too much. I'd like to say that they took too long to get together but really that's just personal preference and I don't think them getting together sooner would have much positive impact on the story, unless we were to have an arc where they were already together.One thing I do wish was different is that I wish they would have realized their feeling sooner, so that there wouldn't be as much drama or people being sad in the end.Overall, if you like slice of life anime, or drama anime, or comedy anime, or romance anime, there is a very good chance that you will like this show.",
        "Due to the fast (and quite good) storytelling, I would suggest to whatch this episode by episode, so not all of them at onceWhat I liked:The clash of adult mindset (represented mainly by Ami) and the childish one (mainly by Taiga).Unfortunately Ami does not appear immediately in the series, but please be patient, you will not regret, she often define herself as \"mature person\" and also her friends recognize this to her, of course with \"mature\" she means \"adult\" (she is still 17years old too).In one episode she tells him \"I think your kind of friendship with Taiga is not \"normal\" but you are too stupid to understand it\": off course adults usually try to drive relationships instead of running in the unknown, Ryiuji on the other side don't care so much about these things and never properly understand Ami.Ryuji care a lot about Taiga as he grew up without a father so he likes to behave like kind of father to her (although he never explicitly say), and Taiga unconsciously like it because she hate / do not recognize her real father.To the viewer the decision what is better or worse.What I didn't like:1. Minori: The realism is usually one of my main driver, I met many teenegers with a kind of \"foggy\" mindset but she looks really artifact to me, a puppet moved in order to create some \"mess\" to make the story more twisted.2. The quality of the drawing: don't get too much stirred by first intro, the quality get worse and worse till the end.3. There is basically 0 use of pauses, which is a shame as this is usually one of the major advantage of Anime over Manga.",
        "Loved it loved it loved it....\nJust finished with 21st episode and don't know how to react....It's just amazing....\nI'm just blushing, crying, laughing and guessing what would happen next?\nIt's hard to predict .....\nToRaDoRa .....\nNailed it...\nAnd this one is family entertainer nothing's over shown .....Except some characters outfits.....",
        "Boy is dragon and girl is tiger that most episode mention but boy is look scary but girl is do scary stuff and very violent.\nAnd they met and find out they are neighbour and get along with each other to get there interested ones to fall with them but both are just chock when their love interest appear front of them. that happen too much.But show try to tell that love is not nervousness it confrontable with someone kind of thing. Hard to tell good to see what is there.",
        "Last episode almost made me cry too, one of my most favourite romantic animes \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude22",
        "When I first heard of this anime, I was given a link to the site with episodes and a series summary. I didn't watch it then because even though my friend told me it was the best anime he had seen, I didn't see a potential for greatness. It looked decent. He had mentioned it other times since then but didn't push me into it. I think it was mostly a \"why not, I'm curious\" attitude that got me to see this show. I watched the first four episodes, not long after I was tempted to see more, and then only stopped because I required sleep. Then I got up early, started again, stopped only because a friend wanted to see me, then finished the show. In short, I was hooked and by the end as close to crying as any anime got me.The story is about an odd boy named Ryuji and a delinquent girl named Taiga, the palm top tiger. Their first meeting doesn't go well. Then Taiga accidentally leaves a confession letter meant for someone else in Ryuji's bag, then goes to his house to make sure he can't use it against her. Instead he calms her down and agrees to help this unruly girl get together with Ryuji's eccentric best friend Kentemura. Their first attempt fails and Ryuji is free to not help Taiga but he decides to continue helping her, and soon enough Taiga becomes an honorary member of Ryuji's family.First off, we must mention the ungodly pacing. The amount of content packed into a single 25 minute episode without having to rush it is mind boggling. A typical Toradora episode has the content of two to three episodes of another anime yet flows naturally. This also ensures there aren't any pointless filler with every episode contributing. This is the only series I can think of where there isn't a single bad or lack luster episode. Every episode is high quality, and you'd be surprised how hard that is even for a twenty five episode show. This pacing also gives immense room for characterization and development, where the show shines most. The five main characters all get a good chunk of development, with the main two getting the most of course, and they all get it every episode in some form or other. This results in the anime becoming a home away from home, with a sense of familiarity and adventure in even their most common activities. The humor, while involving some slapstick, is mostly from the character's personalities, be it Taiga's spiteful snarkyness, or Kentmura's zannyness or Ryuji's habits.This series also boasts amazing drama, and it does so without gimmicks that other highschool romance shows use. We don't see Taiga or Minori getting kidnapped by some biker gang with Ryuji needing to come to the rescue. We don't see attempted rapes or psychotic people trying to murder one of the love interests so they can move in like many highschool romances(and I honestly expected at least one of those to pop up in this show at some point) Now there's not necessarely anything wrong with those plot events, but it says a lot that Toradora can create much more powerful drama with events on a much smaller scale, and don't think this show can't produce some intense moments despite it's light hearted tone.There are still some highschool romance conventions here but they're all played well. Toradora is up there as an all time favorite of mine, with only two anime I can think of that can compete with it. If you've never seen a romance anime before, I'd start with this one.",
        "I must say I liked it better the first time I saw it,but I guess that's because I was younger then.We have a story about normal kids and their everyday lives.They are around 17 years old.The protagonists are a male character living with his mother and a small female one,with broken family,living alone next-doors.They meet and start taking care of each other.At first they constantly fight and mock each other but as time goes by they grow into each other.Their friendship began with a deal.That deal dictated that one should help the other with their love life,since they could not confess their feelings to the people they liked.Of course they always fail miserably,getting into all kinds of trouble,creating funny scenes.There are also some scenes that can get you nervous,thriller and warmed up....The design is beautiful.Characters are portrayed quite good.Even those who are introduced later in the series.I liked Ryou but I would like him to be a bit more steadfast at certain points.His \"holding back\" thing gave room for many misunderstandings,bad behavior towards him and dragged things along.I also liked the Ami character quite a bit.I would like to see some more development there though....I would maybe even like her better than Taiga as Ryou's partner.Minori was really annoying.The later council president proved nice,I did not like him in the beginning.He seemed soulless,always fine with everything.I also liked their single female teacher and Haruka(something like that),their classmate that was always creating laughter for everybody.Taiga's design is a bit weird for a 17 year old girl,I think I would like something closer to a real woman,like some of her classmates and I am not saying she should be like the hottest ones,just a bit more developed.I also did not like the fact they would leave many lines from the dialogues half way through and let you assume and struggle to understand the characters' true emotions.Sometimes that is necessary in a story,but here I believe they used it a tad too much.Towards the end,it gets pretty moving.Ryou's family scenes are really something.Their school friends and their inner wishes and dreams about staying together forever,like that,having fun and talking,being a part of each other's life even as adults,was really sweet....It was so sweet and innocent....It was maybe the most touching concept of the series for me.It made me think about my old life,friends and classmates,how we were always together,never thinking those years would be ever over,playing,running around,fighting,falling in love and experience the sweet anxiety of these emotions while you are still discovering even the most basic parts of yourself....That was beautiful...It's definitely worth a watch,especially if you are a romantic,under 23 person.If you are older you may still like it,but could also strike as a bit light or simple.I has been more than 5 years since I first saw it.Then it made quite an impression on me.Now I liked it pretty much but was able to notice many things that would push me out of it,ideas or scenes I could not relate too anymore.Still,a very decent,beautiful and touching light story.",
        "I've waited so many years to finally watch Toradora, and finally seeing it on Netflix has made me so incredibly happy beyond words!! Now I have seen other love story anime (SAO, Nana, Angel Beats, Your Lie In April) but those don't even compare to Toradora!! I've seen clips of this show on social media, but being able to actually watch the entire show, it is incredible!!! Seeing the character developmental arcs for Ryuji, Taiga, Minori, Yusaku and even Ami is amazing. Seeing both Ryu and Taiga admit their feelings for each others best friend and helping one another, but instead falling in love with each other in the end is just so beautiful and heartfelt, it really speaks volume saying \"one day you will meet that one person and develop feelings along the way, just be patient\" I do wish there was a movie of Ryu and Taiga getting married. But for now, just enjoy the show and let the feelings flow. I highly recommend Toradora if you want a feel-good anime to watch!!",
        "To be honest I never liked anything that has romance in it but Toradora proved me wrong. It's honestly one of the best anime I've ever watched. Oww man I wish there was a season 2. I loved all of the characters. I binged it in 3 days and it's so fun and light hearted. The motive behind this show is really great. In the end I came to know to know there are people who loves me for the way I am. I have never cried for a show but I seriously need Toradora season 2..I am 100% sure that you'll love it. Go and watch this show :)",
        "I am trying to describe what I felt for Toradora and it really complicates me, it was such a beautiful and sad trip at the same time that it left me with a warm feeling of having seen a story that caught me from beginning to end.\nI know that Toradora may seem to some the development of a toxic story and it may be true, but you have to look beyond that.

Because that's the way it should be",
        "This started with such potential and then characters went downhill fast. The boy characters have the depth and insight the girl charactures degrade so badly by the middle of the season that I get angry watching the blatant boy bashing.When conniving girl rivalry creates one escalation after another and the boys who know better put up with it and allow themselves to be pushed around to a point where you can no longer hope they find a connection. You know the series has jumped the shark an is a waste of time.Trying to remember the last time that I despised characters in a series so soon after it started when I did genuinely care for them at first ...Nothing this horrid comes to mind. I still cant reconcile the guys being referred to as dogs. This was an unfortunate waste.",
        "I feel as though RomCom's aren't able to sometimes implement the emotional pull or realistic themes without feeling corny. Fortunately, Toradora is able to do just that.The characters feel realistic as compared to a few other anime RomComs, and their personalities, and deeper thoughts and stories paint a view of characters that the genre needs more of.",
        "I'm embarrassed to admit that I watched the entire series in less than 24 hours, so I did enjoy it very much. I might be in the minority here, but I was actually hoping that the main characters would end up with different people. They definitely loved each other, but it always felt more like a brotherly/sisterly kind of love. Plus, Taiga was too mean and ungrateful to Ryuuji. She never apologized for yelling at him or hitting him or thanked him for cooking all of her meals, cleaning her apartment, doing her laundry, and all of the other thoughtful things he did for her. He was just way too nice to her and I wish he would have stood up to her crap more. Even so, I don't mind that they ended up together because I knew it would happen from the moment they bumped into each other in the hall in the first five minutes of the first episode, but it was still a little weird to me when they finally did. It would have been very interesting if they had done something a little different and surprised everyone.I would have liked to see a little bit more of the fate of the other students and a more satisfying ending, but overall, I enjoyed it.There was a lot of \"fan service\" in this (giant boobs, cleavage, almost naked buff guys, etc.), which is was unnecessary and distracting.Overall, worth the watch. It's light hearted and fun."

    "Psycho-Pass": [
        "I heard great reviews about this anime and had it on my watchlist for a while, so I gave it a watch! It wasn't an easy watch at first cause I was literally convinced that it's only just a Ghost in shell type of anime (not a fan of it btw) and that I was gonna drop it after the first episode. However as I kept watching the show, I was glad to not diss it altogether because it was so darn good! Shinya, Shougo and Nobuchika were the characters I found pretty interesting. They are such badasses like honestly I liked each of their \"tough guy\" attitudes but rather in a more likeable way.Definitely yall if you like your sci-fi, crime, police, thriller and mystery genres, this is definitely for you!",
        "Psycho-Pass stands as a thought-provoking and gripping journey into a dystopian future where technology governs justice and morality. Set in a world where a system called the 'Sybil System' monitors citizens' mental states to identify potential criminals, the series explores the ethical dilemmas and consequences of such a society. The intricate narrative weaves together elements of cyberpunk, psychological thriller, and crime procedural, creating a compelling and intellectually stimulating storyline that challenges viewers to ponder the nature of free will and societal control.The character development in Psycho-Pass is exceptional, with the protagonist, Akane Tsunemori, navigating the complexities of her role as an enforcer in this high-tech dystopia. The show's animation, coupled with a haunting musical score, contributes to the atmospheric tension, enhancing the overall viewing experience. Psycho-Pass succeeds not only in delivering suspenseful crime-solving but also in sparking discussions about the ethical implications of a surveillance-driven society. It's a standout series that leaves a lasting impact, blending thrilling action with profound philosophical themes.",
        "I love anime that put my brain into gear such as: Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost in the Shell... even though most of the time I don't understand the hidden meaning behind the anime it still left a deep impression on me so it no surprise that after discovering Psycho-Pass a few days later I managed to marathon the hell out of the series and now it has become one of my favorite anime series of all time. There 2 season, each one deal with a different anti protagonist and each one ask the character and the audience a good question about what is right and wrong in our beliefs but in my opinion season 1 is superior because the main villain Shougo Makishima honestly is the best anime villain I've seen in a long time while Kirito Kamui of season 2 is just okay. I also don't flat out hate the main character Akane despite her self-righteous personality got herself and the team into big trouble because after all she is the one us audience supposed to be related the most but to see her make the same mistakes over and over kind of annoying not gonna lie",
        "In the future, technical advances have made it possible to see a person's potential at first glance. A person's psyche can be screened through the Sibyl system. The result is shown in color and in numbers and is called Psycho-Pass. This can be scanned anywhere and anytime. Depending on the color of the numbers, it can be estimated whether a person is potentially dangerous or not.\"Psycho-Pass\" shows a very interesting vision of the future and this vision could definitely have been embedded in an amazing anime, but unfortunately that didn't really happen here.Yes, you can watch the anime, but like many, I think the main character just needed more depth.(I didn't finish the anime though because season 3 isn't dubbed in my language yet)Season 3 update:\nI liked it surprisingly well, even if the main characters were almost completely replaced. The new main characters form a likeable and coordinated team.Nevertheless, I stick to my opinion that the concept could have been implemented much better.",
        "I've watched all three seasons of the show and the first season is still the best, in my opinion. I liked it the best because I grew fond of the complex characters that were introduced. It was thrilling and really fun to watch as Akane and Kogami developed an interesting relationship with one another while fighting crime and learning more about themselves. I even cried when Masaoka was killed in action because it was such an emotional scene. And the pace of the show was just right, compared to the 2nd season which only has 11 episodes and the 3rd season which has 8 episodes. Although I must say that I enjoyed the 2nd season more than the 3rd even though Kogami wasn't in it, because at least there were some familiar faces such as Ginoza and Akane had matured in the 2nd season.",
        "The premise is that society built a machine that can measure human aggression and can predict criminal activity before it happens. Basically similar to Minority Report. Also, humanity has become so dependent on the technology that they have become stunted and oblivious to common sense similar to Demolition Man.The problem is the perspective. The show simply takes itself too seriously pretending to be deep and mysterious. It isn't, almost everything is obvious and you knew from the very 1st episode how this would end. The premises are absurd and unrealistic and the plot holes are so numerous that you cant even count them, and yet, the writers continuously try to explain themselves to make it logical which actually makes things worse. Demolition Man was excellent because it knew it was absurd and made fun of the fact through comedy. There is no comedy in this show... it literally believes its own hype.Minority Report was a bit better than this show because it did not drag on for so long. The story here is actually very shallow yet they try to delve into psychology and technology to make it more believable. As stated above, this strategy did not work. It actually worked against the show and made it less believable and characters less interesting. This is no Law and Order nor CSI.Give it a shot if you like. I would say that normal folks might find it interesting but if you are of tech background or have an above average intelligence, this one will bore you to death. I had to fast forward the last 4 episodes in season 1.",
        "Without spoilers it's safe to say Psycho-Pass isn't a \"happy\" anime, but the synopsis and art gives that away.\nIt has Solid characters with good development, thought provoking story arcs, closure while still leaving room for more, really what more could you ask for?",
        "Psycho Pass 2 is way better then season 1 as the first series was a bit if a shonen show overall (all the manga are published in Comic Garden or Jump SQ and a chibi version also exists) that looked and sounded like it was seinen but retarded detectives, a nonsensical and inconsistent world, complete sh*tshows like the high school killing arc, Saturday morning cartoon villainy (MGS Rising robot dog represent), an inconsistent amounts of mostly off-screen violence and bland action men (or men with vaginas) characters made me drop it after 16 episodes. A borderline 6/10 because of the production values. Worst of all i got to read for a year straight how \"cerebral\" and intelligent it was while actual sci-fi seinen fare as GitS: Sleepless Eye never crossed the border.No more sitting between the chairs this time though as the new team decided to turn Psycho Pass it into a 90s OVA! The companion manga is still shonen but the violence is directly on screen and in your face. It is also admitted that only incapable idiots would get to be cops so a bunch of Gendo Ikaris and their children would be able to run the world while sitting in dark rooms and playing war games. Society would need to be evil to actually function and now it is! I love it how come idiots continued to play the witch-hunt game after they found out what it was about and the bad guys are now finally glorified rock stars. I also like that they gave big bad Frankenstein-senpai a cute slasher girlfriend. The music is ace too (what an ending!) and right out of Deus Ex. Best of all there is no rape appreciation like 90s OVA'S used to have and the female characters get to be as capable (or hilariously not) as anyone and why does everyone on cyberspace hate Freckles-chan? She may be heaps dumb and corrupt but so were most of the cast. Well done IG as your series now gets to sit besides Gantz, JoJo and Terraformars as fun escapist manly men entertainment without any of the pretentious crap from season one. Sure intelligent shows like Ergo Proxy, GitS, Lain or Texhnolyze are better but this was still an exciting ride and the ending was highly conclusive and calmer than i expected. My biggest complain is that the story felt a bit cramped and at least 2 more episodes would have given the show more air to breath but the show put the \"punk\" back into cyberpunk so i am happy overall. The action focused movie look fun too and i could use an OVA miniseries to close off if the direction of season 2 is followed up upon.",
        "I enjoyed both the seasons, well made, very cleaver in using paradox's to build up the superb plots. The mind game between the police and criminals along with the justice theme reminds me of Death Note, just instead of magic we have technology this time around. The series is based on a future where technology has progressed so much that by a Psycho scan the state of mind of an individual can be predicted and action can be taken to prevent them from becoming criminals. Further to maintain the sanity of the detectives, they are encouraged not to do the killings, instead latent criminals who are already considered to be criminals do it for dirty work and are called enforcers. Psyco Pass got a lot of philosophy with deep meaning underlining the plots. Philip K. Dick, George Orwell and Jonathan Swift work are mentioned and discussed. The series start slow, building up pace gradually as it moves forward and by the end we are entertained with an excellent plot, realistic characters and gruesome scenes.",
        "\"plz maintain the status quo, because maintain it\" , which is hilariousTruly we live in the times of revolutions - for such an uncharismatic defence of an existent society, which has some advantages none of which are shown, is probable only, when people in power are out of arguments regarding why they have to keep their power.Not really a cyberpunk anime, but a weak social meta-cricitism one.",
        "*please keep in mind that I have only watched season 1.Psycho-Pass is a Sci-fi Police Anime. It first aired in 2012-2013 and is animated by Production IG.The anime story was good in the first half but then it got worse in the second half. I would have preferred if the Sibyl system wasn't so prevalent because I did not care about it that much. I definitely would have preferred if it was just about catching criminals and then had some sci-fi undertones. The main villain was quite boring and I was not interested in him. Other then that the story was great.I didn't like how the screen time was divided among the characters. The inspectors/enforcers screen time wasn't divided fairly and it bothered me. Akane Tsunemori was the main character and she was the focus a little too muvh, in the anime but besides that the characters were well written and were plentiful.The animation was quite unique. It was very nice looking and was fitting. The backgrounds were amazing and it didn't overshadow the focus. The character designs were all great, especially Akane.I watched the sub and it was fine. Both OP and ED was really good but I'd prefer only 1 ED/OP but its the norm to put 2 in a 20+ episode anime so that's fine.In conclusion, I found it entertaining but with some serious problems. I might or might not continue this series in the future. I would recommend this anime to anyone wanting a Sci-Fi crime anime like GITS.",
        "It's mix of police drama, murder mystery and dystopian fiction. The characters are fun and likeable. The animation and art style are nice. The soundtrack is fitting. I think the world building was very well done. Its always nice to have a female protagonist in anime who isn't overly sexualised, victimised or obsessed with men, she's a pretty realistic character who is fun to follow. Likewise the villain is interesting and commands attention from the audience withouy being neddlessly dramatic or flamboyant but cold and sinister. I never thought that the characters had plot armour and the story always felt as if the stakes matter. Too bad about the second season though.",
        "After Death Note, Psycho-Pass is yet another Animation series that kinda deserves full ratings as it put your brain into gear. The show is more than just a murder mystery thriller; it's comprised of Philosophy, Psychology, Society's true nature, Freedom of individual, Merit-Demerit of Technology,y, etc. It has strong and intelligent characters and the way they refer to the quote of famous authors to prove their points is just Astonishing. Great Music, Gripping Screenplay, Beautiful Animation, Deep and Intellectual plot, and Awesome Dialogues/Quotes. Do Yourself a Favor and Watch this Masterpiece on Netflix! Highly Highly Recommended! \u2764",
        "The story line is good but it all ends up being anti climatic. It doesn't make you care or feel connected to the characters. Thinking about the plot it makes perfect sense to have the characters do what they do but watching it.. It all seems so boring. Which is weird considering the good plot and story line it has. The character Akane Tsunemori is the only one you can feel a connection with everyone else just feels like an background noise or a means to an end. Sybil is alright as a character but it too seems anti climatic.Overall it is a visually beautiful with a good story line but that's as far as it goes.",
        "Although I enjoyed this show the first time, I think I'll enjoy it even more the second time around. Definitely check this anime out. It's something very unique that I think everyone should experience.Style/Aesthetic: This is one of the stand out aspects of the show. The futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic of the show is fascinating to look at. Rich in detail and full of style, this anime is a feast for the eyes. The art style is beautifully and intricately stylized. It's got this sort of bleak, moody and gritty style to it sort of reminiscent to Death Note. The overall tone of the show is quite bleak, grim and serious. And this is my biggest problem with the show - it's too serous! It takes itself too serious and I'm not a big fan of that. There's not enough humor or comic relief to break up the tension that persists throughout the show and I need that. Especially in a show where the world is so bleak and grim.Story/Plot: The premise of Psycho-Pass is fascinating. The concepts and ideas are innovative and groundbreaking, and of course thought-provoking. It's the reason why you continue watching the show. The whole concept of the Dominator and Sibyl system is pure genius. Some ideas in the show will leave you speechless, asking yourself how in the world did they come up with this? This show really puts into perspective how twisted and unstable society would be if everything was dependent on a faulty and unreliable technological system. It completely warps people's way of thinking and you see it clearly throughout the show. Psycho-Pass poses some very significant questions about society, humanity, technology, criminals, the human psyche, existentialism, moral judgment and the laws that are integrated into society. The show also does a great job at creating suspense and mystery. The pacing felt like it dragged at times but overall it's fine.Characters: I honestly don't remember much about the characters lol. I do remember the different character arcs being interesting and there was good character build up and development going on. I just don't remember specifics.World/Setting: There's nothing like the world and setting in Psycho-Pass. It truly feels unique. It obviously takes some inspiration from Minority Report, but still, this show has it's own thing going on. Now, although the world feels very fresh and interesting, it does tend to be more on the darker and bleaker side. There's parts of the city that are completely inundated in water and uninhabitable. And the overall tone of the setting feels very unforgiving, hostile and unwelcoming. Very synthetic as well. There's nothing really organic going on, other than humans.Dialogue: Dialogue is very important in this show. If you're not paying attention and just so happen to dose off, you might miss something crucial. At times, it felt like there was too much dialogue instead of visual storytelling.Soundtrack/Music: The show's ending song is so frickin good and fits perfectly. Overall, the soundtrack was great. It compliments the shows tone, visuals and style. It's synthy electronic goodness.",
        "As with a lot of these reviews there is an awful smell about them! That said after working out what the person was going on about and the self imposed \"cool\" abbreviations(GITS SOC) I agree that PP(sic) is one of the best I have seen for a while. Intelligent writing, terrific character development, a plot line that leaves you the viewer to work out what's happening, just the right amount of suspense and excellent graphics. Not so sure about the robotic/hologram assistant with the pubescent high pitched voice but that comes with the territory I guess .Give it ago and see for your self.",
        "This is the type of anime that reminds me why I love anime's - you just can't put these things into a real show or movie, well, not in the next 50 years or so anyway.Cyberpunk, dystopian, futuristic with a dash of nihilism and other social problems, experiments, inequalities, psycho pass is such an incredible anime, especially when you consider it does not have a manga. The universe is huge, potential is unlimited and I love what the producers and studio have created.While I admit that the movies and other seasons are not as good as season 1, just because of the two main protagonists and their charm, the other seasons and movies are definitely worth your time if you love this universe. Season 1 was close to a masterpiece, lightning in a bottle, and I just have a glimmer of hope that I might see it again in the future.Watch everything, the 3 seasons, movies - they're all connected and you will have a good understanding of what is happening in psycho pass. The world is hard, beautiful, characters flawed, not black and white, but different shades of grey. I'm just hoping the quality maintains or even better, goes back to S1 levels, but cheers to many more seasons.",
        "\"Ghost In The Shell,\" \"Innocence,\" or \"Blade Runner\" fans, those who seek thought-provoking realities into a story, or people who like watching stories that make you think about technology and humanity. Then, you may also like to watch \"Psycho-Pass.\"Technological advancement and lack of humanity is an open question all- time throughout the history. While we are seeking to enrich our lives by using gadgets and machines, we may lose something important as human beings. What if we are born in a safe society where criminals and even potential criminals are managed and isolated from the society in order not to harm other good citizens, and they are guaranteed to live in the society with given happiness. We may not even have questions about morality.In the story, a person's mental state is simultaneously measured, and the value is determined whether the person is potentially a criminal and is killed depending on the state level. The police officers use a gun, but the gun is only fired if the targeting person's mental state is measured as dangerous, seemingly it also helps them avoid shooting the wrong person. Akane Tsunemori is a novice officer who is in charge of solving crimes with other members.One of the things that astonishes me is the dialogues where characters talk, referring to quotes from famous authors such as Philip K. Dick, George Orwell, Gulliver Travels, Wiliam Gibson, Macbeth, Humlet, etc. The lines that characters speak casts philosophical questions as to what is justice and what is an ideal society.I really like the story in which it depicts a different aspect of the technological world from Ghost In the Shell or Blade Runner, yet somehow it reminds me of those epic anime and films.",
        "I can only say for 6 episodes I have watched, after that I couldn't take it anymore. I was looking for good anime detective show after Death note. Sadly this isn't the one. The writer tried really hard to create a dystopian society where everything is judged from psycho meter. If this is how medicine advanced, it has actually regressed. The other thing I hate about it is that instead of subduing criminals, they execute them on sight. What about the information you could obtain from them? What about law and order? Many crimes which were committed make police looks more incompetent. Writer forces his own ideas in the show. When Rikako's father dies from low stress, I said that's it. Stupid writer is just making stuff up. People life span reducing coz of low stress stupidity. If you have made a world consistent with real world, please put real world elements! Don't stupidify the show by putting what you think is right. I won't be surprised if writer later on put stupid elements like brain wave communication or aliens. Not worth it. I should have watched Detective Conan instead.",
        "The show is remarkably well made. I personally felt that season 1 was more enjoyable had very fleshed out characters and I felt for each character. So when it comes to season one I would rate it 8.5/10 but when it comes or season 2 it all kind of felt off the antagonist was not as convincing and the whole plot felt kind of boring. When actually shows that Shinya Kogami was very important character to the show and because of Shinya Kogami not being part of season 2 they were no interesting characters in the show. Season 2 was more of like a 6.5/10z",
        "Psycho-Pass is a fantastic anime with a great story and great English voice acting from Robert McCollum\nKate Oxley Alex Organ Lindsay Seidel Josh Grelle\nScott Freeman and Jason Douglas.The show also has great animation memorable characters and great dialogue scenes, especially with\nShogo Makishima.I also enjoy the chemistry between Shinya Kogami and Akane Tsunemori.I also thought it had entertaining action sequences and two great hand-to-hand combat fight scenes that are probably one of the best hand-to-hand combat fight scenes I've seen in anime so far.I also thought it had a great score by Yugo Kanno.",
        "A psychological experience in the truest sense, with character mystery and mystery around the systems governing the very world that the series is predicated on.If you enjoy things like that, this show is for you.",
        "There is probably nothing I like more than stories that further develop and question sociological and philosophical ideas of freedom, justice and prosperity. And when the concept is entirely turned around like in this anime, it is bound to get me interested.\n\"What would happen if our society was ruled by an allknowing device that judges who is bad and who is good?\" is the question this anime answers, and it does it very well.To start off with the negatives...\nI didn't feel like I wanted to continue watching after the first few episodes. In the beginning, a lot of exposition gets splashed at you, making it a bit hard to follow and slightly confusing. The good thing is though, that the protagonist Akane is just as confused as you are, and you get to experience the conflicts in the story together with her. I was also put off by the gory presentation of how the main weapons in the anime work, thinking it was a bit too exaggerating for an anime focused on solving crimes. However, once you really start to grasp what kinds of twisted things happen in the background, the gore of the weapon is the last thing that troubles you.And now the good parts.\nThe writers did an outstanding job in evolving Akane's character. Through interaction with her fellow colleagues, both inspectors and enforcers, she questions her job, the validity of the system she had sworn to serve and her own purpose in this world. At the end of season one, on the very last scene, I believe you will find yourself extremely satisfied with the way the story has done a full circle and with the way Akane has developed into a respected inspector.The villain? Picture The Dark Knight's Joker; remove the silly costume, add more philosophy into his criminal intents - and Shogo Makashima is born. The same chills you get by watching Heath Ledger's performance will pass through your spine once again, perhaps even slightly amplified due to the fact that this show doesn't hold back on gore. However this time, there will be no one who can pass judgement on Makashima; and that is the spark that lights the fire of this anime.This is the first crime-related anime I've seen, and I can say I am satisfied with the way it ended. And should you be interested in answering the question above, or just want to find a nice way to spend your in-front-of-the-screen time, I will recommend it to you. Enjoy.",
        "This anime is brilliant! Psycho-Pass is a very smart series that deeply analizes freewill and whether or not a person's \"hue\", when cloudy, can determine if they will become a threat to society. Using a special weapon known as \"The Dominator\", detectives are able to continuously read and send psychological data to determine a persons crime coefficient. Depending on how clouded a persons \"hue\" is, they will either receive mandatory rehabilitation, or an execution on the spot.At first I was not going to give this anime a chance, but I am thrilled I did! I love the dark, mysterious, and serious atmosphere of this anime. Additionally, the logical questions postulated regarding aspects of freewill and whether or not a person can be judged before they commit a crime were magnificent! Furthermore, every character added a significant element that made them both likable and unforgettable. Finally, the animation was beautiful, and the music significantly heightened every situation. In many ways I would say this series is already comparable to a series like \"Cowboy Bebop\".In short, Psycho-Pass is a juicy sophisticated anime that will appeal to many mystery/sci-fi fans. It is animated craftsmanship and definitely worth the watch.",
        "Psycho-Pass is set in the near future, in which the ability to detect the \"state\" people's mental through simple detectors it has effectively eliminated the crime.Any thought \"turbid\" is detected by the so-called \"sibyl-system\" which in theory is then able to detect in advance any criminal action, and to put an early correctionThe \"arm\" of the system is the body of \"public security\" of which we follow the events. The \"perfect\" society will prove deeply flawed and very \"sick\" (as you might expect). However one of the strengths of the series is to not demonize this \"idyllic society\" is not without its flaws but it is not the worst possible.Of each of the changes bring you an \"sibyl\" fact They are finally well weighed the pros and cons, perhaps leaving the viewer to judge which I assure you is not unanimous.As in other works of this kind \"science fiction\" provides the ideal base for philosophical speculations and psychological. Psycho-Pass proves a number far from trivial, as you may It may think its plot, a really good job 8/10"

    "Rurouni Kenshin": [
        "I liked a lot this anime series. It was very enjoyable to watch, and it had a very good plot (Which makes a perfect balance of action, comedy, drama and heartwarming moments) The characters from this anime were very likable and interesting, being very well developed.The animation starts being merely decent, but it gets better as the series advances. The art is pretty solid, with very cool and well made designs. The music was excellent. Despite some forgettable filler episodes, this was a very entertaining animation, with lots of virtues and memorable moments.Personally, I think that \"Rurouni Kenshin\" is at the same level that other great anime series such as \"Trigun\", \"Wolf's Rain\" and \"Samurai Champloo\".9.5/10",
        "First of all the story is iconic and timeless. The notion of a champion warrior who has killed many in the name of a cause, yet, when that cause is won, chooses to lay down his weapon and swears never to kill again is ... brilliant. It could easily be turned into an action story anywhere in the world, or even an American western, but at time of writing I cannot think of a US analog. This animated series based on the manga is wonderful. It is well written and the English voice actors do a great job. There are also a number of moral lessons buried in the stories but you would expect that. Interestingly I enjoyed this so much that I made an effort to find the live action feature based on the tale and was thoroughly disappointed. The animation is better. Entertaining for all ages.",
        "Ruroni Kenshin is one of the best television cartoons ever made. Its characters are colourful and fun to watch, they're not your typical Shonen-cast of anime characters, and the fact that this series is a period piece makes it stand out from quite a lot of the other animes on the market. It's nothing like DragonBall Z, Naruto nor One Piece. THIS one focuses on Meiji-Period Japan; and a samurai who's vowed to never kill another soul again. This series is an appealing yet culturally- specific show that oddly works for a general audience. Its story is engaging, its direction fast-paced and never dull, and the voice-acting (of the Japanese cast) is pitch-perfect.This series is definitely worth a watch; even if you're not a hardcore anime fan!",
        "''Rurouni Kenshin'' is one of the best anime series that we can watch, specially if you are a fan of samurais and Japanese habits, since the story is set during the early years of the early Meiji period in Japan. But more then enjoying the anime and the manga, I think the OVAs are the best,not only Kenshin's story is much more interesting , but also we have more accurate facts. The atmosphere is much deeper and serious as well. (And Kenshin's romance with Tomoe is so beautiful and dramatic!)The series,OVAS and manga tells the story of an assassin named Kenshin Himura, best known as the Battousai, a guy who killed many men.Kenshin later grieves for all the lives he's taken, and has vowed that he will never kill again, that's why in the series he is a cute and funny person, while in the OVAS he is deadly cold and lethal.",
        "It is the tale of a wondering samurai warrior called Kenshin Himura seeking penance for his past crimes as an assassin known as \"Batt\u00f4sai the man-slayer\", during the Bakumatsu (the final days of the Tokugawa government) in Japan.He seeks and finds shelter in the dojo of Miss Kaoru Kamiya. Miss Kaoru is the primary instructor of the Kamiya Kasshin-ry\u016b fighting style developed by her late father, and she wants to resurrect that style of fighting.Kenshin himself is the master of the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu style of sword fighting. He rescues Kaoru when she is in dire trouble with a local gang of thugs with is ferocious fighting style.Kenshin finds much in common with Kaoru and he moves in to stay with her. Kenshin is then joined by in later episodes with Sanosuke Sagara and Yahiko My\u00f4jin. And so begin the adventures of Kenshin....This is my favorite anime of all time. It has plenty of lessons to teach us about life. The character of Kenshin is very humble and polite and at the same time full of courage and justice. He is dedicated to protect the weak and to uphold the law and fight oppression when necessary. There are 95 episodes in all, followed by 3 animated films namely Samurai X: the motion Picture, Samurai X - Trust and Betrayal, and Samurai X - Reflections. Overall full 10/10 and a historical masterpiece, a testament to that age, that honors those brave Samurai who perished on the battlefield and shows the suffering of those in that age. Kenshin may your ideals inspire the newer generations and may you always find a place in their hearts.",
        "This was (is) one of my favorite anime shows from all time. It was almost perfect in every possible way: Had very likeable characters, nice action, a beautiful plot, a great soundtrack and a pretty great art style.What Nobuhiro Watsuki did was reprehensible, and personally I think we cannot sweep that under the carpet.I will always cherish the great memories this series gave to me (After all, making the director and animators who worked on this series guilty by association would be totally unfair) I think that I will have to learn to appreciate it from the same manner I'm still able to appreciate Lovecraft's writings, disregard of many of his awful beliefs.",
        "This is one of the most memorable and most recognizable anime I know, with a cast of great characters and story lines and funny sub-plots, it's everything you'd want to see in an anime. It starts out as Kenshin Himura a wanderer in the Meiji era, ends with a kendo teacher Kaoru Kamiya, and he starts living with her, and eventually she finds out this is no ordinary traveler, this is Battousai, the slasher! An infamous samurai who killed a lot of people in his past. But finds him to be a sweet gentle man who is kind towards children, who wants to restore peace, and end his days as a slasher. Later more characters appear, Yahiko, and then Sanosuke, then Megumi. A great cast with very dark and dramatic backgrounds filled with tragedies. Every episode seems to give each character some background and info and their dark secrets. The soundtracks are also great, I love the one by L~Arc~Ciel in the latter episodes. The sword fighting is also cool, and unforgettable. But wait, a few characters portrayed or based on actual people, like Saitou Hajime and Aritomo Yamagata, oh my, I wonder if they were really like that in real life, I mean their personalities as seen here. Anyways recommended to all anime fans, and to non-anime fans who are not familiar with anime yet, forget Dragon Ball or Pokemon, watch this.",
        "The stories of Kenshin are extremely varied. The OAVs are massively violent and deal mostly with the serious side of Kenshin. Next, when you come to the first few episodes of the tv series, there is the 'ORO' extreme, or the funny side of Kenshin. but then, later in the series, it gets completely serious again. I haven't seen all the episodes, but i like the funny Kenshin.Anyways this is a great show, but it looks like they switched styles halfway through. They need to bring the ORO back!",

        "A Classic Anime a great adaptation of Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga and its full of interesting characters and even villains.It is also set in a very interesting time the Meiji Era over a decade after the overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the protagonist Kenshin Himura a former assassin who fought for the Isshin Shishi but has sworn never to take a life ever again after a tragedy happened to him. His vow never to kill means he carries a special kind of sword called a Sakabatou which does not kill.Kaoru Kamiya was sweet but had a mean temper but she was a great character though sadly there have been a few poor imitations of her out there.Yahiko Myojin a young boy of samurai descent at first exploited by Yakuza but saved by Kenshin but trained by Kaoru very smart mouthed lad and looks up to Kenshin.Sanosuke Sagara a street fighter who was the survivor of the slaughtered Sekihoutai he lost not only his friends but the only father figure he ever really had Captain Sozo Sagara. At first an enemy of Kenshin due to the anger he still possessed at the Meiji Government but after their fight Kenshin reasons with him and he becomes Kenshin's loyal friend.This is a great anime!",
        "First of all, if you're going to watch Rurouni Kenshin, and you're planning to watch the English dub, MAKE SURE you get the good one. There are two English dubs out there and as I write this, Hulu has the BAD one, and Netflix has the GOOD one. In case this changes, the good one will actually refer to the female lead as Kaoru. The difference in quality is so drastic that if you encounter the bad one, you should just stop watching. The bad one is an absolute abomination.That having been said, Rurouni Kenshin is outstanding. Like alot of these sort of shonen/fighting anime it's based around bold, brightly defined characters who are fun and comedic. They 'level up' through increasingly challenging encounters. The characters have superhuman levels of skill and/or powers/or gimmicks. The enemy has an elaborate backstory and the fights end up spending half or more of the time exploring these character stories. Fighting anime really isn't about the fights. It's about character stories.What's unusual about RK is that the main character's power-up arc is mainly about going backwards. He was already a god-tier fighter, but he's thrown some of his skill away to become peaceful, but is pushed ever closer to having to kill again by challenging circumstance. This obscenely powerful, but pacifist protagonist thing is copied ably by Vash the Stampede in Trigun which is also really good...but it also kind of the same story.It's also neat how the show is ALMOST historically accurate. Some of these people like Saito and Hitokiri Battosai, and others were actual real historical figures. The political backstory is pretty accurate. Of course, then they exagerrate and make it cartoony, but you are in danger of learning stuff about Japanese history if you watch this so...you know, you've been warned.The first season is mostly episodic until you get to the Oniwaban Group arc. It introduces the characters that will be some of the pillars of season 2. It has a definite kids-show morality to it, but it's fun and the characters are good, so try to look past that.The real quality is season 2. This is peak Kenshin. The enemies are stronger, but it also is very much about how the experiences of the past molded the villains of the present. It's a clash of two men being scarred by the misfortunes of war and walking different paths thereafter.Season 3...falls off REALLY badly and has nothing to do with the previous arcs. Honestly, unless you just can't help yourself, skip season 3.Be aware that there is Samurai X. You should ABSOLUTELY watch Samurai X AFTER you watch the first two seasons of this show. Part of Samurai X is a prequel to this, so you might be thinking you should watch them in story order. DO NOT DO THIS! The Samurai X content is WAYYY darker and will hit harder if you've watched the lighter TV series content first to develop an attachment to the character.",
        "(Hiten Mitsurugi is Kenshin's signature technique to anyone who hasn't seen this btw) This tale of our legendary swordsman Kenshin Himura aka Battousai will be considered one of the best and timeless animes of all time. Its a good combo of a story and action for all anime-lovers of any sex or age. Meet Kenshin, our red-haired traveller from Edo (whose physical features make him look younger than his age which is 29) who carries with him two distinct marks: one, his X-shaped scar on his left cheek, and two, his reversed-blade sword. The series tells the journey of Kenshin along with his friends (Kaoru, Yahiko, Sanosuke, and Megumi ) in his quest for a reformed life. Haunted by his past, he sought the ways of a new beginning. Rectifying the mistakes he committed during the time he was still known as the highly-feared Battousai during the Tokugawa era, he vowed to use his reversed-blade sword to defend the oppressed. In his desire to fulfil his promise of making up for the lives he ended, his new life wasn't easy. Along the way he meets new people, new friends, new enemies. Personally, the highlight of the series for me was the Makoto Shishio saga. Its a good sequence of episodes to build a vengeful opponent, with his team of henchmen and then proceeding to be the battle that might cost him his life and his promise.The series involves multi-dimensional characters and unsubtle themes. Story, humor, and action has been well-balanced in this series that's why it's not boring yet substantial. Friendship, love, compassion, betrayal, morality, revenge, reformation, politics, name it. They're all on Rorouni Kenshin. With some humor(as is usual in most animes) and excellent swordfights, this anime will hold your attention. Some might find this your typical man-trying-to-reform type and the usual good-vs-evil concept but still..the series has its charm to keep you watching. It is one of my most favourites and you could ask me in 20 years time, I'll say the same.",
        "music...I mean soundtrack, that's must be it. Sounds weird, but I feel like watching bebop essence combined with love hina slapstick humor style.In a bigger picture, I would prefer the 1st 4 OVA because of it's touching feel, but this one is surely not to be missed...and 95 episodes, wow, despite the last 30 episodes might not be as strong as the previous ones, not many series can go that long without giving a \"lame\" impressionmaster Hiko, and miss Megumi are definitely my favourites (and I sometime got weird thought if they ever become a couple o_O )",
        "Where do I start? This show rocks! A lot of people have cableor satelite TV, and if you're one of them, lucky for you! Just tune in to Cartoon Network every day at five-thirty (central time) and watch this show. I'm not asking you- I am COMMANDING you! You gotta see this! It's not often that a TV show I absolutely love comes along, so please, take my word on this. I am not going to give you quotes from the show, or anything of the like. I am not going to summarize the story or anything like that. I am just going to present the facts. This show is superb. If you don't watch it... you ARE going to watch it. There is no doubt about. We have an agreement that whoever reads this is going to watch this Rurouni Kenshin. In fact, if you don't have cable and can't get it, I advise that you BUY the DVDs. Now, no more... you are going to watch this show that deserves more praise than I can possibly give it. For your sake and my own (do not cause me the pain of having to stay up late at night weeping, hoping that you have seen the goodness I can't describe). Please watch it. PLEEEASE!",
        "This is a truly fantastic series... dramatic characters, a hero that is capable of huge mood swings (from goofy, to romantic, to blood thirsty), and female characters that you would swear your life to protect or swear..well... I must be civil.Great sword-fighting actions scenes, a drop of history (it takes place in the 1870s), and some philosophizing about living a life of violence versus peace make this series cover the gamut of emotions a viewer wants from any series, not just anime.I hope everyone can take notice of this story, it is not for everyone, but it hits so many points relevant to our current world order: from terrorism (bad guys attacking the fragile government), to being able to look at the world as something other than a battlefield (Kenshin vowing not to kill after so many years as an assassin).",
        "This is one of the greatest anime series I have ever seen. I have been introduced anime on relatively recently...1997 at earliest. In that time, I've gotten my hands on a number of really good and really bad shows. Kenshin is definitely among the best.The dynamic emotions of Kenshin himself as well as the mix of humor and philosophy of life vs. death in the show make it exceptionally entertaining and captivating.The mutual devotion between Kenshin and his friends, Kaoru, Sanoske, Yahiko, etc... is amazing to watch as it develops and is put to the test.The sadistic enemies, and the foolish ones, all provide foils that drive the plot and cause the viewer to be moved as Kenshin struggles to throw off his murderous past in favor of a life defending his honor, his friends, and the innocent.If you are a long time anime-buff, or a new fan of the genre...this series is a must-see.",
        "I'm absolutely in love with this show. This show is the best anime I've seen. I watch it everyday and all the episodes of this show rock my world, it has a very good music, and the greatest special effects.\nKenshin Himura is the best character in this show and he's one of my favorite characters of this show. The best villain of Rurouni Kenshin is none other than Makoto Shishio, but the other villains like Shogo Amakusa i don't like them very much because they become good guys at the end.\nGreat show. I gave Gundam Wing a 10/10 but this show i give this a 21/10. Finally I can say about this show in three words. Great, Awesome and most of all the best anime ever.",
        "Rurouni Kenshin is an epic anime series about a wandering swordsman named Kenshin Himura who protects people with his reversed-blade sword. Rurouni Kenshin has everything you could possibly want in an anime series. It is available on DVD and VHS.",
        "Ruroni Kenshin (Known in Samurai X in the US) is one of the greatest animes of all time. Ruroni Kenshin has everything  an anime fan could want: a compelling story, interesting characters, and equal amounts of bloodshed and character development. I have seen a few episodes of the subtitled version and the first two OAV's \"Trust\" and \"Betrayal.I recommend both of them, but the subtitled version is much better.If you haven't seen it before, then buy it (don't rent) and add it to your anime collection. It is an essential anime title for the anime fan I also recommend Ghost in the shell, Ninja scroll, the Dragonball Z and Gundam series",
        "If you're looking for a great samurai story it doesn't get much better that Ruroni Kenshin.Kenshin is just about the best samurai to ever pick up a blade, but now that Japan has settled into the peaceful Meiji period guys like him are no long needed. In fact, ex-samurai are scorned by the public in general. So Kenshin sets out to try and find a normal life for himself. In time Kenshin finds a home and friends in a Tokyo dojo but ghosts from his past keep popping up as do people out to destroy the new government. Kenshin, who has vowed never to kill again, isn't about to let anyone disrupt the new life he's built for himself. So such times come he reluctantly heads out to knock some heads.I really just can't get over how great this show is. Richly draw characters, great action, compelling stories, romance, humor and more all set against a very real felling backdrop of late 1870's Japan. RK works not only as a good anime, but historical show as well.One other thing I like about the show is the villains. RK's creator (whose name escapes me at the moment) is an admitted fan of American comics and you can see that in some of the villains. Psycho killer Jin-E bears an (pardon the expression) uncanny resemblence to Gambit from the X-Men. I've also seem elements of characters like Spawn, Wolverine, Omega Red, the Absorbing Man, the Incredible Hulk and Daredevil in some bad guys. Really cool.In short, Kenshin is a show that belongs on the shelf of anyone who calls themself an anime fan.",
        "This anime has everything to be one of the best animes in the entire world. An amazing plot (and even based in the history of Japan), an incredible OST, and excellence in art work despite being made in 97', that transports you to the magic of Japan's 19th century.The plot revolves into very interesting subjects that keep being controversial in the contemporary society. Amazing how they could reflect XIX century's Japan's problems into our times.Character developing really takes a good part of the excellency of this anime. You get to the ending of it loving all of them, and wanting that it last forever. It is all very heart warming.You can also learn a lot of history watching this, as they make it interesting and it has a good base.The battles and the technics of the characters does not need to be artificial to make you feel impressed. Using only sword styles that existed all along Japan history, they'd managed to make every battle a masterpiece.Even the comedy is a genuine gem on this one, making you truly laugh.It's a must watch for all people loving this genre, no matter how old or young they are.",
        "This show has a lot of potential, especially with the Kenshin character. He has inner demons and a dark past that makes him very interesting. But I find it hard to stay interested in him, since his biggest goal in life is to lead a peaceful every-day life with his friends. I prefer characters who has dreams and ambitions.The supporting cast is nice, and complement each other very well. There is the ken-jutsu instuctor Kaoru, the young-but-eager-to-beome-a-man Yahiko, there is the bad-ass ex-villain Sanosuke, the foxy female doctor Megumi, and many others.While this show has excellent potential, it is only on rare occasions as good as its potential. For one thing, the show contains a large number of lame fillers. Also, the show seems to, for some wierd reason, to focus on the bad-guys rather than on the main-characters that the viewer actually cares about. Another annoying thing is that Kenshin is so fast that the eye cannot see him move. Which is cool at first, but boring in the long run, since you'll seldom be able to see him fight.  On occasions there is chemistry between the characters, but it never seems to go anywhere, and after 90-something episodes, I don't even care anymore.Most of the fights are kind of lame. At first, there is a long seqence showing the bad-guy bragging of how good he is. Then there is a long sequence showing Kenshin's friends talking about how good he is. Then the bad-guy tells his entire childhood-story to Kenshin. And then Kenshin tries to defeat the bad-guy by giving him a *lecture* of what's right and what's wrong. Then the bad-guy shouts: \"shut up you talk too much.\" Then the entire sequence repeats itself, along with part 2 of the childhood-story. Then they shut up and look at each other for a couple of minutes. And then, finally, the bad-guy attacks. Kenshin does his faster-than-the-eye-thing, and the fight is finished in a split second. And then the bad-guy changes his beliefs and becomes good. LAME!There WAS, however, an excellent arc of episodes, known as the Kyoto-arc. It spans from episode 28 to 60-something, and in this arc, Kenshin returns to Kyoto to defeat a man who threatens to take over Japan. The story-arc is good because there is a bad-guy that's actually *dangerous*. Also, it is good because we get to learn more about Kenshin's past, as because he considers letting the demon within take him over. A very enticing story-arc with many powerful combats. Excellent episodes!However, the show should have ended there. Because after the Kyoto-arc the show turns lame. It doesn't really get any better than the end of the Kyoto-arc, so the last 30 episodes feel kind of stuck-on and sucky. There were some cool episodes here and there, but not really worth the time to watch.In all, Kenshin is a very uneven series, that ranges from TOTALLY EXCELLENT to I-WANT-TO-KILL-MYSELF-BECAUSE-THIS-SUCKS-SO-MUCH.",
        "At first, I wasn't really drawn to a tv show that I hadn't heard of. It used to be on cartoon network, in Toonami. I decided to watch it one day, and after only four minutes, I was hooked. At first I found it kind of boring that it was set in the time period it is, but soon after I started watching that fact didn't bother me anymore. I love the story behind it. The characters Kouru, Yahiko, Sano, and of course, Kenshin. I loved how Kenshin had been a fighting samurai but didn't want any part of it anymore. And I've got a word to Auryn-4, who reviewed this earlier. If you think some of the Rurouni Kenshin series is boring you probably aren't a true Anime fan.",

        "Rurouni Kenshin, is one of the best animes I've ever seen. I first discovered RK when I downloaded the first chapter of the manga. Then I became addicted to it as the story of a wandering swordsman trying to atone for his sins really got me excited and started downloading more manga issues. The first time I saw the anime version was after I downloaded the first episode. Now Rurouni Kenshin comes on my satellite dish on LBC SAT from Lebenon. I give this anime 10/10 it is an anime masterpiece that shouldn't be missed. A must see not just for anime fans but for fans of the samurai or chambara genre(Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurais and Zatoichi) as well."

    "Planetes": [
        "Some Japanese animes have this style of starting silly and happy, then suddenly turning all serious and philosophical. This is one of them, and, if it weren't for those stunts in the very last episodes, when they left the outcome of very tense moments for the next two episodes, I would have marked it with a 9.Anyway, this is all about humans exploring (finally) space and the people that venture doing it. In the end, it becomes clear that the point of the series was not technology or space, but human nature, the way we all connect to each other, and what we can accomplish together.All in all it is a cute anime. It starts really silly, but ends very well. And for a 26 episode anime, it certainly kept me on my toes. A word of mention about the soundtrack, which I found good towards very good for an anime, with mostly Japanese songs (even if sprinkled with the now customary English words).Bottom line: worth seeing.",
        "As an old sayings go \"Shoot for the Moon.\" or \"Tis better to aim high and miss then aim low and hit.\", the common human trait is that of the desire to aim high whether it be career or just simply life itself because of our constant belief that things will get better that tomorrow will be a better day. No matter how much time has gone by even if the settings changed desire never will.This is a criminally underrated and overlooked anime gem that is one of my personal favorite animes but also one of my favorite tomorrows world sci-fi's. This shows is similar in vein to Arthur C. Clarke sci-fi, it shows a believable world of tomorrow that looks possible and plausible. The rich mix of both 3-D computer animation and the usual but sophisticated Japanese anime which makes all the characters and settings look almost real. The music is superb it's a calm orchestra tone to make the scenes in space almost feel like an opera or even fit what the characters are going through. We see how advanced civilization has got but also see how beaten up and exhausted it has became on itself. We witness how despite certain advancements in science they've also paid a severe price by becoming careless in how they treat their enviorment in space. Even the politics involved have put too many barriers on sometimes the smallest things. Nothing always works right, even some of the spaceships some people have look like their days are nu8mbered. There is also a sense of boredom and how space travel has became reduced to nothing but an everyday commodity taken for granted instead of a frontier of endless possibilities.However its really the characters in the show and the drama involved which make the show truly work. Mainly the duo dynamic between Hachimake and Ai Tanabe whom are another of my favorite anime couples. Hachimaki I think is awesome, he's young, brash, unsmooth, a loner, rebellious where he doesn't just break the rules but he bends and breaks them, and obeys the rules he writes in his book. He's also borderline selfless and selfish, but has a strong ambition of traveling out into space and exploring the untouched frontier. He's also an underdog as he is kinda a blue collar worker struggling to make his dream come true but also some thing that happened in his past which made me respect him even more and angry at those that have abandoned or shunned him for no good reason. Ai Tanabe is also young, pretty, naive, brave, selfless which can make her never very realistic when it comes to certain matters however that turns out to be a strength that Hachimaki very much needs. Both of them have a slightly shaky but close friendship,they both agree or disagree with one another and but both do have one thing in common and that is they deeply love each other as more than just friends whether they know it or not. We feel pathos for both of them from what they go though and their feelings for each other evolve but so does their career.In a strange way the career their in starts to look bigger and more important; the Debris Haulers aren't janitors in space but are like Firefighters or Emergency Workers doing the best they can to make space safe fore everyone. Indeed it really is the Debris career that matters the most, and personally I think it's a cool job, getting to go out into space and working with lots of technical equipment. Even though the careers below are considered the higher up careers, they start to look smaller and not as important; those careers are a little lame in my book what the heck else do they even do other than just monitor.The show has ethical themes like enviormental ethics and why science and human politics must learn to act responsibly for human progress. But also deep post modern philosophy on heroism, ambition, love, man's place in the universe, and how much more a person can be.The universe is vast and big, enough room for dreams and love.Rating: 4 stars",

        "Anime is a very underground phenomena outside of Japan, but in Japan anime studios make more money than live action studios. This vast industry has produced thousands of TV series, some of which were amazing. This is one of those. Perhaps one of the best Sci-Fi TV series ever made, Planetes is a must see for any science fiction fan and represents one of the most realistic attempts to depict space colonization. It has about the same degree of realism as 2001: A Space Odyssey and indeed many things in the series look like they were taken from 2001, such as the designs of the space stations and of the space planes.The shows also builds up to a fantastic finale, among the most dramatic and powerful ever to grace television.",
        "A story about how the potential colonization of space could be over before it properly started all because of tiny bits of space junk, and one of the teams in the \"lower ranks\" of a space company charged to clean (financially interesting bits of debris) up.I watched it in Japanese with English subtitles and still managed to follow the story arcs of the team that make up \"Half Section\".\nExcellently crafted episodes in a very clear-drawn anime style will provide plenty of interesting insights in various types of reasons why people actually like it in \"Half Section\".",
        "Planetes is a science fiction anime based in the year 2075 with the story revolving around a crew of the space debris collectors. It's Unique with its approach, lots of reasonable hard science along with the realistic portrayal of human society gives it a genuine representation of what our future might look. It is slow to start, nothing much happens initially besides us getting introduced to the main characters and this futuristic yet familiar world. Why a familiar world, well mankind hardily changes, topics such as individual greed and ambition, the richer countries monopolizing resources and spending billions on luxuries while poor nation starves is still prevalent. But what really gets the anime working is the personal life of the quirky main characters, the love angles and silliness which follows them around is great. There is lots of drama, comedy, romance and action and all of it seem believable.I did feel the storytelling took a drastic turn with the MC turning lame mid-season with his self-loathing and anguish. Also, the ending story arc was just terrible, yes realistic but I don't need to like it. The final episode did make amends otherwise I would have hated this anime.",
        "Planetes (Ancient Greek for wanderers, planets) most likely is the most realistic space anime of all time. For me, that was the point that initially sold me to watch this series, especially after the first episodes didn't make much of an expression.So, taking care of the negative first, those first six episodes are probably the only thing that isn't excellent about Planetes. They're not necessarily bad, just fairly trivial and silly. Nevertheless, these episodes introduce most of the important and recurring characters, like the two protagonists Ai Tanabe and Hachirota \"Hachimaki\" Hoshino, and the other members of the \"Debris Section\" they work for. Some of these first episodes aren't all that bad either, though I personally loathe the sixth one (\"The Lunar Flying Squirrels\").From that low point, the quality in narrative content steadily increases. An overarching plot line starts develop and comes into full effect around episode twelve (\"A Modest Request\"), though it isn't until episode sixteen or seventeen that the episodes stop being episodical and instead tell a continuous story. The last few episodes feature a very strong narrative with a surprising amount of tension that I never would've expected from the series' beginning.Like many reviewers highlight, the shining star of Planetes is the faithful depiction of space flight. There're no Faster Than Light or Artificial Gravity gizmos, just what can be explained with our current understanding of physics and extrapolated from current technologies. I'm sure a layperson could learn a lot about space travel from the series alone without being bogged down by dry explanations; as an astrophysicist I was giddy throughout the series whenever Planetes took something into account that most other series and movies would just gloss over.The production value of Planetes is also fairly high. I loved the visuals (especially those of space stations and space ships), the soundtrack is very good, and even the English voice actors range from pretty good to excellent. Admittedly, for that last point it is noticeable that the dubbing budget wasn't extensive; all the characters sound pretty US-American, even though the characters come from all over the world. Then again, it's probably a boon that we don't have to fight through Russian and South American and Japanese accents all the time.Another thing that's an immense plus in my eye is the lack of fan service. The sexiest thing you'll encounter is normal people wearing normal clothes with normal camera angles. No out-of-nowhere nudity, no boob shots, no eroticism at all. While the humour feels at times a bit forced and overdone (especially in that infamous episode six), Planetes clearly isn't a show specifically targeted at horny teenagers but highly enjoyable even for the \"traditional grandparent\" type of person.",
        "\"Astronauts are wage slaves just like any other\" -HachirotaThis series would be fantastic if it hadn't insisted on adding office politics, capitalism and even working visas in the mix. A shame as I loved the characters, animation and music. I just can't stand seeing episodes akin to The Office in a creative sci-fi anime. I assume it was meant to make it look realistic.",
        "\"Planetes\" is great Anime and great science fiction. It is as if an Arthur C. Clarke or other classic science fiction writer had their work translated to the beautiful art of Anime.In the story it is the year 2075. Humans have a permanent city on the moon, have been to Mars, and are planning to send the first people to visit Jupiter. The main character 'Hachi-Maki' is a member of the Debris Section -- a group of astronauts that remove space debris near Earth -- and busts his hump to get on the crew of the planned Jupiter mission.A bonus of the first three DVD's of the series is a bonus disc of interviews with real NASA experts on the logistics and problems of the man-made debris orbiting Earth.The animation is flawless, the story is filled with humor, and the soundtrack has superb music. This is a very fun and inspiring Anime series. Recommended very highly!!!",
        "This is anime for those who liked 'From the Earth to the Moon', 'The Right Stuff' and perhaps 'The Office'. It really is the most realistic and enjoyable sci-fi/comedy/drama film ever, beating out both '2001: a Space Odyssey' and the excellent sci-fi mock-documentary 'Voyage to the Planets' (known in England as 'Space Odyssey') in terms of its devotion to realism.Although the series is set 70 years in the future, the show uses only the science we use now and that we can be fairly sure will exist at that time. No warp drives or matter transporters here, only good old fashioned rockets and good old Newtonian physics. I think I've learned more about the realities of space exploration from a few minutes of viewing this series than I ever have from years of keen interest in space documentaries and NASA TV. In my view, this show should be required viewing for astronauts in training - yes, it's that realistic and that informative.This show proves that realism can make for truly great science fiction. We don't need di-lithium crystals when the real story is where it's always been (whether we're talking about Star Trek, Star Wars, 2001 or indeed Planetes itself) - in the interactions of well-written characters.The show starts off a little over-the-top (more like 'The Office' in space) and there are a couple of episodes in the first few that are more than a little corny, but there are also a couple of episodes that are hilarious - the one where they meet ninjas on the moon is classic! After the first seven or eight episodes it settles into more of a thoughtful and well-written drama with the occasional humorous scene. I enjoyed the dramatic episodes equally as much as the comedy episodes - there's a lot to like in this show, and watching the characters grow is definitely a big part of that.If I have any criticisms of the show, it's with the English dubbed version that can be found on US DVD releases. In some ways it's better than the Japanese version (e.g. Hachirota \"Hachimaki\" Hoshino's voice sounds more age appropriate in the English dub), but all the characters speak with an American accent - every single one - and this comes across as very odd, since it's quite obvious that at least two of the characters are Japanese and one is Russian. Now I can understand giving the Japanese characters American accents, since the DVD is intended primarily for an American audience which is meant to identify with the leads, but the choice for the Russian is just strange. But I'm not going to make too big of a deal of it - once we get to know the characters, their accents (or rather the lack of them) kinda fade into the background.Altogether, Planetes is an excellent show that can be enjoyed by anyone who doesn't have an aversion to cartoons. Some episodes may not be entirely suitable for kids though - not because there's any unpalatable sexual content or violence, but because some of the issues discussed are more serious (i.e. the real effects of poverty, death, disease etc.). Like many Japanese anime movies and shows, this is definitely geared towards for teens and adults.In my view this is the best show for space fans since HBO's 'From the Earth to the Moon'. Anyone who loves space exploration should take a look at this show.",
        "I am truly amazed how great this show turns out to be from a science-fiction fan's point of view, and I do not mean the kind of movie science fiction which relies on CGI as its main asset and suffers from poor unrealistic plot. I mean the kind of literary science fiction that gets awarded with a Hugo award. Perhaps one should forget that this is an anime, for the simple reason that the stereotype of anime is something like a TV show for kids where a bunch of clich\u00e9d, depth-less characters battle supernatural enemies with their superpowers. If that is what anime means for you, think of Planetes as an animated series made in Japan. Removed around eighty years from the times it was made in, it presents quite a believable picture of what space exploration might be like at the end of the 21st century, with a load of detail comparable only to the movie adaptation of 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is one of the strongest points of the show - the richness of little details, like how rooms have to be adapted to zero G, makes the sci fi elements more believable. The strongest point, however, would be how great science fiction this is. One definition of science fiction would be that a science fiction story depicts the way more-or-less imaginary technology (or the fruit of some science not directly related to technology, like chemistry) impacts human lives. Apart from the development of the regular characters of the show, every episode contains a story in that vein, with a great deal of insight and care for consistency. It is harder to show something gripping in science fiction with more-or-less realistic technology than in a flashy movie where the technology used is nothing short of magical, yet Planetes achieves that in every episode. Also, since the future gadgetry depicted is so often directly connected with the plot, and at the same time, so believable, Planetes could also be categorized as a cyberpunk show set in Earth's orbit, and I mean cyberpunk like in the later William Gibson stories, not like in, say, Cyber City Oedo 808. As I said, you won't see any technological magic, not even at the \"AI virus gaining consciousness\" level. I'm sorry I can't recommend this further without any spoilers, but if you have ever enjoyed good SF literature, be sure to check out this show (at least the first 5 episodes, to see what it's like after we've gotten to know the main characters), and you won't be disappointed.",
        "planetes is an anime very particular.the genus to which it belongs is sometimes referred to as \"hard sci- fy \" a fiction that has no scientific errors and inconsistencies , and then describes a possible world and in the case of planetes would say even likely. The series is about a near future, after fifty years, the central theme is the colonization of Earth's orbit. some details are very interesting: devices to be able to spin in space taking into account the center of gravity, propulsion with liquid helium, lunar installations etc. ...I must say that I really do not understand why it is a genre so little explored, for once, you can even do without aliens headless demons of death and time travel. I felt the lack of an anime of this type, I was very impressed 8/10",
        "I thought I'd seen and read too many stories and nothing special would move me in this special way anymore. I was wrong! I'll skip what other reviewers already told and would like to add that in the philosophy- or humanity-part of it all, it's very seldom that left and right, or good and evil, or whatever ying and yang you have are so overlapping, so vague as in this story. The personal goals, experience and decisions from all sides, just make sense. So which side is the good side? This is how reality is. And I won't spoil it, but one highlight to this for me was near the end of it, where the anime has also a very nice resolution* between the dilemma \"elite space exploration and solving things on earth first\". * Although I wouldn't really call it an \"overall\" resolution -are there even ever any, also in real life?-, let's call it \"progress\" but it sure makes an example to some of the world leaders, rebels, freedom fighters, ego-wolfs, troubled souls and what have you, including to myself. Thanks to all the people involved in making this unique and motivating space flower!",
        "The protagonist in Planetes is Ai Tanabe a young woman with ideals that seem naive to some, if not many, of the other characters in the series. The series centers around her newly acquired job and all that follows in Debris Section aka. Half Section because it has half the employees it should have. Due to an accident involving space debris and a spacecraft Debris section was formed. Planetes has been described as being one of the most realistic animes science-wise. While this may be true Planetes is so much more than just a science based anime. The series progresses really neatly throughout the 26 episodes it spans and at first the episodes are about general debris retrieval, but later develops into other subjects like the gap between the poor and rich down on Earth due to space exploration etc. and what consequences this may lead to. Furthermore it is a love story between Tanabe and the male protagonist Hachimaki and their struggle to maintain their relationship through hardships since they both (especially Hachimaki) have some existential problems to solve. The animation is great and the mood is even greater, it is a joy to watch a scene when the characters float in zero-G or when they are out in space in total silence. A series that shouldn't be missed if you like love stories and Space or just one of those two. You Copy!",
        "As a child, I read many science fiction books (I still do!) and I was firmly convinced that I would see with my own eyes at least the first stage of human conquest of the New Frontier - the Space, at least in our Solar System. Now, I see a new impetus in the development of the space industry, which gives me cautious optimism. I believe that only a great dream can justify the existence of humanity. And this dream has always been associated with the discovery of the new and unknown. While watching this anime, I felt a kindred spirit of its creators. Despite all the obstacles, doubts and tragedies, people look at the starry sky and dream. And that is great.",
        "It is undoubted that Planetes greatest strength is its plausibility. It adds an excellent twist to the sci-fi genre that differs from the norm in anime and the general sci-fi flick.This series isn't running rampart with fanatical ideas but is instead very down-to-earth.I don't want to spoil much but I will say that Planetes is about \"space janitors\"... ... ...I know, how can a show about Space Janitors possibly be interesting, but towards the later half of the 21st century space junk has become a major problem and that sets the basis off the entire story.Planetes isn't all about the technicality of rubbish collecting, it is really a reflection of humanities desire to keep moving forward and the press on relationships that people develop and people's determination to achieve their objectives and goals, even if that means hurting the one's closest to you.Planetes also asks many political questions about \"how much is enough?\" \"Who gets the gold?\" \"What will become of the resources? Will they be divided or will they remain in the hands of those with authority?\"These are just some of the things that make Planetes shine in all the genre's that it represents.A thoroughly enjoying watch, recommended for any sci-fi fan.",
        "There are no aliens here. There are no FTL drives and no giant mech suits. This is Planetes.Following a small space junk recovery team, Planetes gives insight to what living in space would really be like, gracefully balancing the personal issues of crew members, just living their lives, with the tremendous impact that space colonization would have on human civilization as a whole.No science fiction has left me more wondrous with the concept of space life, more bewildered at the fact we aren't there yet, or more flattered simply for being the same species as minds that created this fantastic anime.This is the near future of space travel and it doesn't need action or fantasy to tell the story of humanities first steps into the solar system.

        "I just have no words to say how much i liked it! This is exiting! There's a lot of humor but it's a very serious movie!

I think author is very talented and even maybe genius person! Movie shows us problems people will meet in the near future. Garbage in the space. Now we see that it's unreal but in the movie it is happening. And you believe it! As the movie comes to the end you realize that you went through all adventures with characters and you fell in love with them! You just got used to them! Its incredible! Really! You have to watch this! Sometimes its very dramatic but sometimes its very funny. The same in real life. After some good news we have bad ones... Look and enjoy!!",
        "...and often this is exactly what makes good sci-fi. Focus is heavy on character development, and the debris-hauler protagonists are repeatedly called to ponder on what space is, and what it means to them and to the rest of the people that are far from being astronauts. As the story unfolds, their answers to these particular questions change dramatically along with their psyches - this is something audiences rarely see in such entertainment genres. The main plot device with the terrorists never manages to take center stage, although it is above average and it does end with a bold twist; an alternative post-9/11 narration made back in 2004, which one rarely sees even 13 years after the actual events. The writers have tried to keep the whole thing realistic and have been successful at it; one will not see anything out-worldly happening in 26 episodes. Sure, books/pens/motorcycles do look very much out of place in 2076 but such anachronistic elements can easily be dismissed in favor of suspension of disbelief. Although the mood is starkly uneven, turning from generalized lighthearted-ness in the first half to *very* dark overtones as the series progresses, in the end heroes and viewers alike have made a complete circle and are ready to move forward, only this time they are wiser and more optimistic than in the beginning. Overall this is a must- see for space-loving teens, boys and girls alike. A very welcome change from spaceships blasting each other to bits.",
        "It's hard to explain why this anime is so amazing some might say the story, the music, the characters or maybe the visuals but for me it's a combination of all of these factors.I feel like this anime has one of the best story lines ever because it doesn't give the all the answers right away I love it when this show hints or gives the viewer 'half-answers' but like a thread the arc's unravels little by little and during that time we see the characters true feelings and thoughts we get in there lives to the point that by the end the story leaves a very emotional payoff and satisfying 'real answers', I feel Yuri's arc is like this (don't worry no spoilers), and when we see these characters true feelings they ironically feel down to earth and to the point where we can understand them all even when they collide against each other. Also every character has an arc everyone is connected and has value to the story, and while the ending isn't wrapped with a bow or anything by that matter it does what every ending is supposed to do be satisfying, perfectly.",
        "For anyone who loves good story-telling and perhaps most of all SPACE! This show cannot be beat. I was genuinely moved by many episodes, and as a space geek I was VERY impressed by how accurate the science was (not perfect but damn good).The themes that are explored and the development of the characters is much closer to that of an hour long American drama. In this case it's Firefly in anime.Indeed I would say that the writer, Makoto Yukimura is the Joss Whedon of Japan. The writing is that good.Don't pay any attention to people who complain about how well the show was dubbed. This is not important. A good story is a good story. This series is so good that I was able to easily overlook production shortcomings.It's been a very long time that I've loved a TV series this much. It's smart, funny, genuine and nerdy all at once. This is a show for people with a head and a heart. Most shows require neither to be \"enjoyed\".Planetes is exceptional, and I only regret it was so short lived. I love it. I love it. I love it.",
        "This is by far the greatest piece of sci-fi media i've ever seen. It is criminally underrated and just about as perfect as one can get.",
        "Please, better anime about space. Millennials can not understand))",
        "As many reviewers said: The outstanding feature of this this series is realism. Like there are extra Smoking Lounges course open Fire in spaceships is dangerous and oxygen is a rare good. Or the Girl born on Moon. Looking like a 17 year old Teen, but she's only 11. Born and raised on Moon with its lower gravity it has an effect on her growth. Radiation of the Sun, G-Rolls and so on.The other realistic thing in this series is the picture of the human mind. The poor envy the rich ones. Some of them working their asses of to achieve things the rich ones have, but are held down. Some others say: \"If we can't have that now, we just destroy the thing, that we cannot have. To be equal.\" <- Going the easy way.This kind of thinking we already have (IS) in our days, and had thousands of years ago (Kartago - Roma). It's just sad that the people who have learned from history are put down by the masses who refuse to learn.Anyway. Back to the series. It does have everything i need: Heartwarming Characters, some good jokes, but not to much, a atmospheric soundtrack and something to think about.I really recommend to see this one.",
        "When I first watched this series, I watched it with a group of friends in college. One of these friends was getting his degree in astrophysics. In the middle of one of the episodes, he got up screaming, yelling at the TV, \"They got it wrong! Space doesn't work that way!\"He ran out of the room, grabbed his textbook, ran back, slammed it on the coffee table, and started flipping through, finding a recent chapter. He then looked at the chapter, and his shoulders slumped, and he said, \"I'm the one who got it wrong.\"After that, it became a contest to find something this show did wrong. Astrophysics, psychology, sociology, politics, design process, you name it. All of it. The entire freakin' show got it all right. The people who made this did their homework, and did it well. And not just for an anime. It's the most realistic sci-fiction I've seen out of any sci-fiction ever. And not just science fiction. It's the most realistic fiction I've seen out of any fiction ever. I've seen historical fiction whose characters acted less realistic. (Granted, some of the characters are a bit goofy, but it's just their supervisor encourages them to bring their hobbies to work for stress relief, which is even realistic for his position.)So when things happen in the show, you laugh harder, because not only is it funny, it's funny because it's true, and it's true so much. And when things happen in this show, you cry harder, because not only because it's a tearjerker, but because it's a tearjerker in a way that reaches much deeper than something fake can. There are still scenes I cry about just thinking about them, years since I last watched it, and I can laugh about the ending of Old Yeller.This is simply the best there is. If you made me choose between this and Star Wars, I would choose this. If you made me choose between Star Trek and this, I would choose this. If you made me choose between the Matrix and this, I would choose this. If you made me choose between Titanic and this, I would choose this. If you made me choose between Eva and this, I would choose this. If you made me choose between Frozen and this, I would choose this. Whatever you would make me choose between and this, I would choose this.This can touch you deeper than anything else you've ever seen, and likely will ever see again, if you give it the chance. It's extremely real, and you can look at it, and see our future in their eyes."

    "Honey and Clover": [
        "I like the fact this anime was easy going, especially involving light jokes amongst the lads. I also liked the fact we see the guys grow with each other from day one and become such independent men but like they'll always be with each other. Thirdly, the animation was gorgeous and I enjoyed Yuuta's journey as a backpacker by experiencing Japan more! Quite stunning it was and I was relived that he came back home because I felt he was gonna get lost. However at least he came back without any scratches on him hehe!Definitely give this anime a try if you just want a break from destructive anime you would normally see!",
        "I got to see the entire series from Bittorrent.Honey and Clover is a comedy/drama/realistic fiction anime.It's involves these College Students who start to get to know each other more and more than they did from episode 1.The flow of the anime is slow but it does have some interesting stories. Animation is just perfect for the way the series is.I got to learn how much a yen is in US currency and got to learn other Japanese culture reference that are featured in the series.I really enjoyed it. Has some random parts in some episodes, but I do highly recommend it to die hard anime fans.It would be in the PG area for adult situations, mild humor, and some language.I hope this series will get it's own English dub someday. Once it does be sure to buy the DVD if you like non fiction anime.",
        "I can assume that this one won't be for everyone, in fact I have tried to get a few friends to watch this one but can't seem to tear them away from Bleach and Naruto. But if you get the opportunity, I highly recommend watching this as it is a really special series. The storyline follows a group of friends who are enrolled in and art college and the day to day complexity of adolescence and life in general. Every character is wonderfully thought out and are way more complex that they may initially seem. It really helps to give them a life of their own and although many characters follow the archetype of anime they really become memorable through their humanity. The main character is especially well realized, using voice over to share his thoughts and feelings with the viewer. It isn't an entirely serious show though as it is at turns hilariously witty and just plain silly fun. The show is riddled with pop culture references like the obligatory Star Wars jokes, digs at other anime series and even Bill Gates. It also joins the ranks of other shows like Azumanga Daioh that treat there setting of modern day Japan with love and respect, from summer festivals to little nuances that are often hard for westerners to understand but delightful all the same. This series made me laugh, cry, and really think about my own life in ways that previously only Haibane Renmei could, though it would be wrong to compare the two. Oh and the first seasons EP is wonderfully weird.",
        "The series takes a glimpse into the lives of five students of an art university and allows you to view how these students slowly mature in their thoughts, feelings and relationships. Honey and Clover is a very heartwarming, touching, funny and poignant as it deals with the many issues college aged youth know best. It is not your ordinary slapstick, magic, robot war, cutesy or fan service anime. If you want that, look elsewhere. Honey and Clover has heart, a bit of comedy, beautiful animation quality, style, excellent voice actors, and a wonderful accompanying soundtrack. This series is certainly not for everyone. In fact, this is geared towards the college aged youth, but if you are looking for something deeper and heart felt, I highly recommend this series as well as its soundtrack and original manga."

        "I discovered Hunter x Hunter back then in the 2000s, thanks to the amazing 1999 series.This newer version is very good too, very entertaining to watch, with a really nice soundtrack and very neat animation style.The highest point of the series was definitely the intense Chimera Arc, with the plot often going through very dark places (At least in comparison to one would normally expect from a typical shonen series)While a couple of parts from the story feel a little bit rushed (particularly in the first episodes) the overall is still pretty entertaining to watch, being perhaps one of the best of its kind, almost on par with other great titles such as Fullmetal Alchemist.Totally worth-watching from beginning to end.",
        "This is a very well-made anime, but it's not perfect. The main character feels really two dimensional and his friends are not a lot better. Besides that, it's cool.",
        "I don't understand why this is one of the highest-rated animes ever made. Gon sucks.",
        "I would highly recommend that everyone watch this show. I don't want to say anything to spoil it, and I'm sure that countless others have already provided more in-depth reasons why you should watch it, but still, watch it.I will warn you though, while the beginning of the show makes it seem like its going to be somewhat kid-friendly, trust me when I say that this is not the case.",
        "One of the best anime that I saw in the action and fighting scenes in the anime is great, especially in Chimera Ant arc. The fights were very great, the anime characters were excellent, especially Chrollo Lucilfer and Netero. They were the best two characters in the anime. I also liked that Gon does not win in most battles I hope the anime will continue, but the writer does not want to write",
        "Hunter x Hunter. A marvelous story about a young boy who vowed to become a Hunter just like his father. Tasked with learning skills on both the mental and physical levels, Gon Freeces travels the world in hopes of finding his father who abandoned him at a young age.After meeting Killua Zoldyk who is an assassin in his own right joins Gon on his quest. They soon become best friends and discover new adventures which leads them to mysterious places, along with even more risky roads of dangerous people along the way. Hunter x Hunter captivates the viewer in every episode.Emotions run high during the arc stories especially during the Chimera ant arc. Episode 135 being the most potent of them all for some tense scenes that pulls on the human condition.The music is top notch through out. Action is above normal expectations, as well as learning about the mystic ideals of Nen, which is the interpretation of Chi that resides in any human being. I thoroughly enjoyed this series from the first episode to the last where Gon finally meets his father Ging Freeces.Beyond the obvious plot, I loved every character as well. From Netero, Knov, Morel, Mito and the entire Zoldyk family who are about as psychotic as the bush family line. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree as they say. Between fights of bravery, despair, joy, sadness and anger, anyone who watches this series can relate to each character on some level.Whether they are a fighter or simply a worker. Hunter x Hunter will continue to blaze a trail for those who dare to dream and hope for a brighter future. A word of warning concerning episode 135. Keep a box of tissues handy. You will need it. It was considered to be one of the finest episodes of the entire series.",
        "\" A perfect blend of friendship, comedy, and action mixed in. It's calming yet powerful and comical yet dark. This was one rollercoaster of a journey\".That was a pretty enjoyable show for the most part. An interesting set of diverse characters who feel flushed out and well written, an amazing worldbuilding with barely any holes and with an interesting yet complex and sometimes confusing magic system. The vibes and tones this anime gave off was amazing it wasn't as lighthearted as I thought and got darker later which I really thought was a nice change. The consistency of the anime was .. I don't know what to say. The beginning arcs of the anime were probably the best especially the Yorknew City Arc but it got worse later on especially with the Chimera Ant Arc where half of its arc was in a single battle. And lastly it had an amazing ost and music with splendid visuals to really get you hype for each episode.Overall it was very enjoyable. The only problem was with the consistency. Some battles would be short with constant monologuing and others stretching into a couple of episodes . It wasn't the greatest you know with HXH being 148 episodes and all so I sort of let that slide. I kind of wanted to see a bit more of the Phantom Troupe and more screentime for the other characters from the beginning of the story such as Kurapika and Leorio. Gosh it had a lot of potential if it wasn't for the weaker arcs later on but I loved it still.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Maybe.",
        "Rating 9.5Favorite Episode: Anger and LightA Shonen masterpiece, extremely detailed and meticulously written. The action is very strategic and just as intellectual as it is eye-catching. Some pacing issues in the Chimera ant arc, but it still remains one of the best shonens' ever created.",
        "\"Hunter X Hunter\" is definitely one of the best animes for me.Following Gon's path from the hunter exam to the hunter license is just exciting and just doesn't let you switch off.The fact that he also gets to know Killua along the way and that the two grow together into an almost inseparable team, even though the two are actually so different, is the icing on the cake.You can tell there's love in here because the supporting characters are all very well written, although I think Leorio could have had a little more depth.The anime brings beautiful, sad and also shocking moments.At first glance, it looks like a typical \"kids' anime\", but it's far from that.I've seen it twice already and would do it a third time.",
        "Hunter x Hunter is the best Shonen anime of all time. Although one other anime that is considered Shonen may be better in my opinion, its not strictly classified as Shonen. Hunter x Hunter has some of the best characters in anime. Meruem, Killua, Kurapika, Hisoka, Chrollo, Neferpitou, Gon and Netero are all incredibly well written characters. The philosophy of this show, which I won't spoil, is some of the best in anime. With amazing fights that are never too common, the show makes pay offs feel earned and satisfying. The tone of the show can shift drastically depending on the arc, with the Yorknew City and Chimera Ant Arcs being incredibly dark but also the two best arcs of the show. The Music and voice acting is incredible and amplified emotion way past most other anime. Hunter x Hunter is my second favorite anime of all time and easily is a Masterpiece.",
        "One of the most popular shonen animes of modern times, Hunter x Hunter tells the story of Gon who strives to become a Pro Hunter to find his Father, a Legendary Hunter. A lot of the familiar shonen tropes are present in this anime. The first arc is pretty generic, but it starts getting interesting when the power mechanics of the show is introduced. And the Yorknew City arc is where it shows its strength, with very interesting powered Individuals and a tense revenge saga. And it reaches its peak with Chimera Ant arc, adding emotional drama and a complex dynamic of good and evil. But it has its drawbacks, character development is pretty one-dimensional, music isn't good, pacing issues & main character isn't very interesting. Overall an enjoyable show in parts.",
        "Hunter x Hunter starts off a bit childish, but over the course of its 6 arcs it develops into an action packed story about friendship, brotherhood, the human condition, and loss. Without going into spoilers I can't say much, but this show gets pretty deep and has amazing fight scenes. There's many interesting characters to keep the plot moving.",
        "Yoshihiro Togashi is the mind that brought us Yu Yu Hakusho.HxH is, ironically, the more refined and mature version of that! Because the protagonists here look like middle schoolers, the art bright and colorful, the brutality always seem to come from left field. The death toll is staggering and nobody is safe.One thing that is both a credit and determent to the show is how it's made up of arcs. Mr. Togashi seems to get bored fast so the story is always moving, no fillers here, and it's so fluid that you can easily be in an Isekai with an RPG-game setting in one arc just for the next episode to introduce the concept of giant ants that are literally what they eat... and yet within context it all makes sense and ties together perfectly.HxH is a classic for a reason, the story telling is on another level and nobody here is safe.

        "My 9/10 mangaupdates review and the series stops at Vol 32, Chap 339. I also deducted 1 point as this adaptation rushes a bit here and there while skipping some of the violence and darker content: I have been reading the manga since 2001 and am as satisfied as ever. Great characters and inventive stories are the strong points. Some rushed art later on and one hiatus (he is a sickly man i have read so that can be excused) are the downside. More Leorio would also have been better. All in all i can find hardy any flaws in this great series and hope for at least 5 more years. I would also like to read a sequel to the chimera ant story because that was the high point of the manga. I especially liked how Gon lost his humanity while Meruem slowly turned human and . That is a hard feat as he started off as a cannibalistic child murderer. The whole thing can even be compared to the essentially perfect Parasyte. The Shin York Arc was the next best thing and both showed how developed the world is and that the leading heroes don't have to be the vocal point or all powerful all the time. I especially liked how Gon lost his humanity while Meruem slowly turned human and relatable during the manga's finest hour. I am a bit surprised that SJ allowed all the dark themes and the excessive violence as it is noticeably less young reader friendly then Fist of the North Star or JoJo despite the art style or the more upbeat moments so the manga should just switch to Ultra Jump already like the rest of them. This is the current golden standard of ongoing shonen action without a doubt. The 2 anime adaptations are both good but the recent one is better even if unevenly paced. Both have good ending points btw. as all the arcs tend to do. His two previous works have good ideas but i found them only decent all in all. Yu Yu Hakusho (6/10) is still worth a read despite its uneven and somewhat crazy nature and the ending is very strong in my eyes. Other quality adult friendly shonen are Claymore (8,5/10) and of course Attack on Titan but don't forget Shingeki no Kyojin - Before the Fall (9/10) as it is the best version of that tale. Rurouni Kenshin and Full Metal Alchemist are the perfect golden standard of all time of course! You know what? The first 2/3 of Naruto (7,5/10) are good too but don't tell anyone.",

        "First off, a disclosure. I am no anime expert. My interest in anime is fairly new and it's very superficial so perhaps I am not the best person to review this title. However, having watched all available episodes on Netflix and then begging friends for the final 48 episodes I feel moved to give my opinions as to why I will quite likely re-watch it, and recommend it unequivocally.Hunter begins simply by introducing you to it's main protagonist and his companions as they undergo a tough series of challenges to gain their Hunter license. In the World of Hunter x Hunter, bizarre creatures exist and, apparently so just magic. Gon Freecss is a 12 year old boy who has grown up around nature. Having learned that his father is not at all dead and had abandoned him to live a life as a Hunter, Gon sets out to learn why his dad cares more about his job by becoming a Hunter himself. In the process of finding this out, he also hopes to gain the skills and intel necessary to find his dad, Ging.Essentially, what separates this show from other cartoons is the narrative and incredible use of characters and histories. It is a fully realised World and the characters are all flesh and blood and believable. Although it starts slow and Gon may be a hard character to get behind (seemingly never being bested by anyone and terminally optimistic), the show eventually shows its teeth and begins chomping at the naivety of its young cast. Themes of bad overcoming good, child exploitation, drug cartels and the socio-economic effects of nations run by weapons and drugs and dictatorships (with some thinly veiled attacks on North Korea and the USA's dropping of atomic bombs on Japan thrown into the mix), not to mention hinted at themes of paedophilia and statutory rape, the show gradually reveals an ugly side of the World to young Gon and Killua. The show is also never short on gore with some truly disturbing moments (the aftermath of a character's torture in the 4th arc, the Bomber's Little Flower ability in the 5th arc and a lot of the penultimate arc are quite horrific).Gon and Killua eventually make for a great couple of companions in which to visit this World. Gon, naive and simple, and Killua who is much too wise beyond his years offer contrasting views on the good and bad within other humans. Their friendship strengthens believably throughout the series and the underlying homosexual tones are sweet and never overblown or gratuitous. As Gon becomes more spiteful towards the World (or aware of the fact that being nice won't always win out), Killua seeks to become kinder and connected to other people. As the series draws to a close, both of them are much stronger and mature with Killua capable of companionship and Gon capable of making hard decisions.The other stand out characters are Kurapika and Hisoka. Kurapika, whilst being in probably less episodes than any of the other main cast is given an entire arc when he comes face to face with those who murdered his family, \"The Phantom Troupe.\" Consisting of some of the most strongest, deadliest thieves and villains in this World, Kurapika is forced close to heartlessness and devastation to bring about his revenge. What's fascinating about Kurapika is his yin and yang - for the most part he is by far the most stable and sensible of the cast and yet there are flashes of the rage and blind fury that propels him. In the arc we see him become so committed to his cause that he is confronted with the choice to sacrifice Gon in order to win or be satisfied with waiting til another opportunity presents itself. Hisoka, on the other hand, is chaos incarnate. He lives for no one but himself. This makes him a great ally but also, for majority of the show, a constant pain in the foot for Gon and every other human alive. He has no qualms about killing people and although he is sexually attracted to Gon and Killua, if the situation called for it, he'd kill them.The animation, especially within the fights, is outstanding. As the show's more complex details are brought to light (the case of magic or aura), the animation in fights becomes even more breathtaking. The climactic fight between Kurapika and a member of the Phantom Troupe is insane. The use of colour and sound help push the fight into territory I've never seen before in standard cartoons or even live action. Other stand out moments include Gyro's tale, the fight between Gon and Hisoka and whenever Killua uses his Godspeed.The other beautiful aspect of the show is the music. Expertly used and heightening many moments, it changes the show from just a cartoon to a serious and deserving series. The songs that are used to close the episodes are thought out and a lot of important moments are amplified (the death of Ponzu has a seriously creepy riff playing underneath before the moment and then after, most of the Phantom Troupe's maniacal damage is even scarier due to the choral music and Killua finding Gon inches from death's door in the final moments of the Chimera Ant arc is made even more heartbreaking by the lamento for piano).All in all, I'd recommend Hunter X Hunter to anyone who enjoys action and drama. It contains all the right ingredients to be compelling viewing, subverting expectations and shocking at times whilst being tender and honest at others. Not to mention some incredibly directed and animated fighting. And, let's be honest, it's what you're watching for, isn't it?",
        "Hunter X Hunter is about a 12 Year Old called Gon who wants to become his father, who had left him to become a Hunter.It is based on the manga made by Yoshihiro Togashi and is animated by Madhouse.Hunter X Hunter is a great anime. It has very good dialogue and the dialogue rarely gets boring. The fight scenes are very excellent too. The vast world that they live in is great and I love it. The animation is awesome.Main Characters:Gon : he is the protagonist. He is very likeable and his character development is good. He is constantly getting stronger and he is helping all his friends get stronger as well.Killua : He is Gon's best friend. He is very laid back and calm. He has a problematic family, whom he disagrees with a lot.Kurapika : He is a quiet person and he is hellbent on defeating the Phantom Troupe. He is missing during some of the arcs.Leorio ; He is the comic relief. He is very funny and has a big heart.Hunter X Hunter has a lot of other good characters.\nThe villains in Hunter X Hunter are more complex than in other anime. They have good motives and their motives can change.\nGon's and the main characters acquaintances help move the plot forward but they don't get as much character development, as the villains. They are really good characters that can relate to the main characters.Ranking the Arcs:1. Chimera Ant: The was a lot of great enemies and there was the most danger in this arc. Meruem was amazing in this arc and all the royal guards. They made this arc a lot better. That is why it is my favourite.2. Yorknew City: This arc is focused around Kurapika and The Phantom Troupe. The Phantom Troupe do some great escapades.3. Hunter Exam: It introduces the characters very well. The tasks the people doing the Hunter exams are interesting.4. Greed Island: It is very fun. It has weak antagonists and it has a lot of training in it.5. Zoldyck Family : We learn more about Killua's family and how strong they are.6. Heavens Arena: It has some boring antagonists and is mostly Gon and Killua learning about Nen. Some of the battles are good.7. 13th Hunter Chairman Election : It is boring and the best part was when Leorio punched Gon's father.\nI watched the Sub and the voice acting was good.",
        "I never thought that by the time we got to season 5 the death of someone who one might consider to be a monster would lead me to crying like a baby for days. Such pure love between Komugi and Mereum - nothing like it, nothing at all...watch.",
        "Let me start off by saying that I loved this series, until it reached the true Greed Island arc and became incredibly stupid and boring. What happened? I don't get it at all. This show was intriguing, well written and so fun to watch, but then with this stupid new MSRPG gameplay is both tedious and lasts way too long and downright stupid.I might come back and watch this show again, but I really wish that the Greed Island arc was wiped from canon, or rewritten to actually be good.",
        "The Hunter Exam arc is awesome, the charming cast of characters is really fun to see go through the journey and the multiple challenges. Gon is an enjoyable character and an amazing lead with his strong morals and kind personality. Leorio and Kurapika are amazing supporting characters, Leorio is a good comedic relief and Kurapika is a neccessary calming presence. Killua is the most interesting character as he isn't conventional and has cool skillset. Hisoka is a fascinating antagonist as he is menacing and very mysterious, even without having done anything outrageous, he's terrifying and his reputation speaks for itself. The animation is very colorful and the character design are all great. The arc is really fun, the only thing holding it back is the few last episodes at the Kukuroo Moutain, they where good but significantly less entertaining.The Heavens Arena arc is not meant to be the best arc, but it's still great, it does an amazing job to mix exposition, action and plot. We learn about Nen in this arc which is integral to the rest of the story, you need to pay a lot of attention but it's captivating to learn the rules of this world through the eyes of our protagonist and the words of Wing. The characters of the arc are still amazing, Gon and Killua are still lovable and the company they get in Zushi is really comforting. Hisoka is improved as a villain with more screen time, his disturbing dialogue and menacing presence makes him absolutely terrifying. The fights are entertaining side stories in an arc that doesn't focus on it, there's a lot of them to keep you interested and the final one between Gon and Hisoka is one of the best in anime.The Yorknew city arc improves a lot the anime, it takes a dark turn with dark antagonist that commit violent acts. The Phantom Troupe is filled with interesting personalities that are all powerful therefore threatening to our protagonist. Chrollo is incredibly strong and really mysterious which makes him an antagonist just as great as Hisoka. It's fun to see Gon, Killua and Leorio advancing their low stake plotline to have calming moments after in between the intense story of Kurapika. After this arc Kurapika is definitely improved as he goes from a likeable character to a complex character who has a captivating and perfectly paced story that's great throughout and leads to an incredible ending.The Greed Island arc is easily the worst, it's alright but it really sticks out in an anime as exceptional as this one, the massive problem is the villain. Genthru is the worst villain in a show I love, every scene of his feels like filler, his story only merge with our boys in the last few episodes and feels forced in just for the sake of having a villain. When it comes to villains, the Phantom Troupe running around in the game is really interesting and I wish we had more of them instead. The training of Gon and Killua is interesting to follow and essential for the rest of the show, Biscuit's personality make the training entertaining and knowing they're working toward something big keeps you hooked until the dodgeball game pays off the build up.The Chimera Ant arc is grandiose, although it starts off kind of slow, it becomes a thirty episode fight where anything can happen. The line between heroism and villainy is blurred in this arc which makes it thematically rich. The Ants are amazing antagonists as they are super powerful and their personalities are very interesting, I think they're the best antagonists of the show which is high praise with this show. How the relationships of the large cast of characters are explored makes for some amazing moments of action and emotions. If the first half was condensed it might have been a perfect arc, the first half was pretty but the second glued me to my screen and made the hundred episode worth the time.The Chairman Election arc is a nice breather after the last, it doesn't have a lot of action and it's dialogue heavy instead. The characters are really interesting with the addition of Ging who Gon searched all series. The elections are really interesting with it being really well explained. Alluka is an interesting character with her weird character concept and she's great to drive the plot. I don't think it's fair to judge the arc as an ending since the show is unfinished but as long as we don't get other arcs, it's really unsatisfying. Overall the arc doesn't try to do anything special but it's good at what it tries to do.Hunter Exam arc: 9/10\nHeavens Arena arc: 8.5/10\nYorknew City arc: 9/10\nGreed Island arc: 8/10\nChimera Ant arc: 9.5/10\nChairman Election arc: 8.5/10.",

    "Azumanga Daioh: The Animation": [
        "My teen watches, breaths and lives Anime and Manga. And after hearing about Japanese animation NON-STOP for some time, I thought I'd give it a whirl several years back. As a kid, Japanese animation was synonymous with lousy production values and dull plots. Often this was not the fault of the original production company, but due to American companies cutting the shows to pieces and splicing it all back together in an awful and confusing mess. SPEED RACER is the best example of this. So, despite my predisposition to hate it, I did agree to try some Anime once again.Some Anime, not matter how much I try, I cannot and never will enjoy--particularly ones featuring exploding giant robots (\"mecha\" anime)--I'm just not particularly interested in this style. And some I have enjoyed mildly (such as DEATH NOTE), but of all the anime I have tried, by far my favorite is AZUMANGA DAIO. Regardless of where it was made, it is just wonderful entertainment. What I particularly like is that unlike so much of the super-fanciful anime, this is about a bunch of high school girls--and most of their adventures are very mundane--no explosions, no Pokemon battles and no life or death struggles. It's so good because the characters are all so well made and endearing--you really come to love them. Unlike many other Animes I have watched, the girls on the show seem almost like real people (except 'Osaka'--who is just plain weird!). This really surprised me--I thought Anime was pretty boring up until I watched this series! I am a high school teacher and apparently this series is pretty popular among my students as well. For teens and adults not 100% \"gung-ho\" about anime, this is an excellent series that will surely entertain. If you don't enjoy it, then there really is no hope for you coming to appreciate Anime.",
        "It is difficult to fault this anime, I've watched it all the way though several times and it never ceases to make me laugh. Unlike most comedies it isn't full of jokes the laughs are derived from the interaction of the various characters.There is little plot as such it just shows a group of girls going through high school and various events that happen along the way such as sports days, cultural festivals and Summer breaks by the sea.Each character is distinctive and fun, apart from the girls there are only three characters that are important enough for us to be told the names of, these are the English and gym teachers and the only male character of note the somewhat perverted classics teacher.",
        "I've seen this mentioned a lot as one of the most funniest anime out there but never really dived into the anime until yesterday! I have to say like Asobi Asobase, it really had that natural humour that really make you laugh. I mean it does show what types of teachers you had and what students you encountered at secondary school. Now for me, I have mostly experienced as I'm sure everyone else had some bad teachers like Yukari and good teachers like Minamo. Btw I honestly thought the two women would suit better as a Yuri couple, they would so cute together seriously!Chiyo was absouletely adorable and it was hilarious to know her own biological father was a cartoon mascot type of a cat! That made me effing laugh so damn hard!I liked the humour, the English dub voice actors and just the whole story with all the girl characters involved in this anime! 8/10!",
        "A lot of the \"slice of real life\" manga has become rather stale, but Azumanga Daioh has turned a group of adorable little girls into a great sensation. Most of these slice of life manga items try to make some dull, boring routine funny, but Azumanga Daioh succeeds where others fail. Why? Primarily because of the characters, as they are well-crafted and interact with each other in just the right way. I feel that the funniest interactions between these girls and their teachers were with the extremely creepy Mr. Kimura. This male teacher seems to have two traits: an extreme fondness for girls, and a tendency to give away large sums of money to charity. Fortunately, Mr. Kimura never gets anywhere with the girls. Additionally funny were the \"driving skills\" (or should I say lack thereof) of Ms. Yukari.",
        "I'm your average anime fan. There is no genre of anime I will not watch... especially a crazy comedy like this one.I was introduced to this gem after I went to one of my library's Anime club meetings... I was cracking up as soon as I saw it.All the characters are so different that you'll wind up unable to choose a favorite, but it may be possible for some.As much as I like it, I'd have to debate this: is Kaorin a lesbian? Ah, who cares? it's funny, right? Yeah, that's what I thought.This series is sure to be a favorite of all anime watchers.10/10",
        "This anime is a very significant and unique show. In other words, cool. I loved it. It featured a bunch of laughable and lovable school girls (and a few teachers) and with an anime with school girls, you'd expect romance, drama, and even that magical girl stuff from Sailormoon. Well. This one doesn't have any of those which is a good thing. That's what makes it great. Even though the episodes were kinda of short, it was so great and funny, that you'd want to see it over and over again. Recommended for anime fans, non-anime fans, and for those who are sick of Magical girl or harem shounen anime. Watch it. You know you wannna. I like that Chiyo and Sakaki and even that reckless yet cool driving Yukari-sensei.",
        "See, there can be a situation comedy basically about nothing but doesn't harp on dating relationships and sex! It's so uproariously funny in many places I got both the manga and the 5 DVD anime.No one save the lecherous Kimura has a significant other. There's too many American TV shows depicting singles whether there be teen or adult as being perpetually seeking love. In the course of this too short series none of the girl students date. There's only one episode in this series that deals with teachers dating--These characters present us with other concerns to laugh about--Pet Obsessions, hero worship, who is the smarter teacher, petty jealousy, catching a cold, etc. \"Daioh\" stands out even among it's anime fellow no magical quests, no titanic battles of universal good versus universal evil. The only universal elements is the day to day progress of life and for those who can find humor it's in the characters' a tickling the funny bone.",
        "Last week, I had the pleasure of finishing Azumanga Daioh, an anime which is perhaps one of the funniest series I have ever seen. Set in high school, Azumanga Daioh follows the story of six girl students, their two teachers, and all is wrapped with a healthy dose of hilarious antics.The story is easy to follow, and comedy relies on the user being able to identify with the high-school scenario, but more importantly, each individual character's development, and their interaction with others.There's Chiyo, a child prodigy who has skipped five grades to 10th grade, the airhead Osaka, the random factor of the group, the sexy athlete Kagura, always up for a challenge, Koyomi, the mature girl who dislikes her weight, the energetic Tomo, who is a complete slacker, and the soft spoken Sasaki: uncomfortable with her tallness, and busty physique.The great thing about Azumanga Daioh is that it is different to almost everything else on the market. It doesn't deal with subject matter we're used to seeing in visual media, but instead the basis of all high-school students: trying to finish school. We are shown the girls trying to pass exams, participate to some degree in sporting events, making friends, and most importantly, hoping to eventually graduate, and start life for real. While the story is presented in a rather wacky way, you can't help but feel how true to life it really is. With great voice acting, catchy music, and clear visuals, Azumanga Daioh shouldn't be missed. Perhaps its best viewed once you've finished high-school, perhaps it gives a good view on high school girls when they aren't discussing such issues as sex - whatever reason you might want to, or not want to watch Azumanga Daioh, it must be said that its in a class of its own - no wonder it's become an instant cult classic.Comedy is rarely this good, and easily ranks amongst many favourites, but best of all, Azumanga Daioh hits all the right notes.",
        "When I first watched an episode of this series on the Anime Network.,I gotta say that is one of the best shows of all time. It was so cool that I had to get this series,and I did. It was pretty cool after I bought it at Best Buy on my 23rd Birthday. I really liked all the episodes in order and the opening theme. My favorite funny parts in the show was the one where Tomo showed Miss Yukari the dead Cockroach on her textbook after killing it, and Miss Yukari freaked out and got scared of it.My other favorite funny in the show was when Tomo tried to hit Miss Yukari in the face with a tray,and Miss Yukari got so mad she attacked Tomo. My favorite characters in this show are:Chiyo-Chan,Yomi,Sakaki, and of course Nyamo,the P.E. Teacher. I really do like this show,and what it tells us that an education is the only key factor in life. We all need a good education,and we all must study. Another thing I liked about the show is Monica Rial playing the voice of Nyamo. So in closing,if you have seen the preview,then this is the one. You will see what I mean.",
        "Man what a great show this was. Terrfic and busting your gut comedy. And that is a lot coming from me. I love the dark moody, plot shows where stuff happens. But this I just loved even though it would likely be the last thing I was expecting to love.All the characters are just lovable. There is a child prodigy, Chiyo-chan, who is so FREAKIN adorable. There is the shy quiet one, Sakaki, who's prone to cat bites I might add, and loves cute things. There is an overly peppy and hyper one, Tomo, Kaorin is one who is seems to be rather falling Sakaki, there is the spacey one, from Osaka. Named: \"Osaka\" (The story of my life) And there is Yomi, the down to earth central person. And the two teachers Yukari and Minamo Yukari is such a risqu\u00e9 teacher, while Minamo is sensible. The Sportty Kagura and the freakishly insane male teacher KimuraSo I watched this, and I laughed, I awed, I cried, but mostly laughed. There were points when I was just busted out laughing, and I still laugh when I think about it. When I watched the Sub, what I did here of the voices they are rather good. And the Dubbing was extremely good. Jessica Boone does so well as Chiyo-Chan. Interesting that she has removable pigtails, in Osakas dream. I loved the peppy one. She's like \"I'm late, I going to go stand out in the hall!\" And she does just that. And the spacey one is funny too, everyone is panicking about a cockroach, and she's day dreaming, not noting what's going on. So great character development there. When have that many characters to keep track of, it's hard to keep them all straight and give them all attention. So my compliments to the screenwriter, for keeping them all strong and execllent.Surprisingly catchy music for a comedy, and some very catchy themese, cleverly composed to be very catchy.This is a fine Anime, and you should check it out. It's so hilarious you'll love it. I bought the Class Album and it was the best $60 I ever spent",
        "Well, the comments below tell most of what happens in the series, so I'll just say this is something everybody who is into anime-comedy should watch.\nMy favourite character on the show is \u00d4saka (Ayumu Kasuga). She just cracks me up with her outrageously weird comments.   Kimura-sensei is also extremely funny.  The rest of the \"cast\" is also very funny.",
        "Without a single life-altering event, nothing supernatural, nor any science fiction or fantasy elements, and indeed not even a plot, this series of light-hearted, standalone slice-of-life shorts allows you to get to know these characters through memorable five-minute moments over the course of three school years as they naturally become friends.It's this emulation of the way you actually get to know people as much as the depiction of realistic moments that make you feel a genuine sadness and realize the emotional connection you've developed to these characters when they break the forth wall and say goodbye at the end.From beginning to end, this anim\u00e9 series is nothing short of charming. Rarely have I given any show a ten out of ten but Azumanga Daioh deserves it unreservedly.If you can find it, I recommend the original three-volume six-disc DVD release which include a small booklet with each volume that explain certain puns and cultural items to non-Japanese viewers.",
        "this is definitely for me, for a long time, I've dwelled in complex & masterpiece anime like Bebop, Ghibi productions, Kenshin OAV, Jin Roh, Grave of Fireflies, Metropolis etc until at some point I realize these shows are \"not entertaining\" anymore since they make me think, they make me relate so deep into the characters, got emotionally drained even depressed.Not in the case of azumanga daioh...For me this show is just great, fun, gorgeous, sweet, cute, you name it. It even brings back some highschool memories, there isn't asingle episode where I can watch and not having a HUGE smile, and another smile, and another smile, and.... It sure is hard to pick any favourite character since they all make the show, but I'll go with Sakaki (the cool one with a soft spot), and the \"impossible\" bond setting with Kaorin is particularly sweet & hillarious heh hehRecommended for those who want a change of atmosphere into a cute, funny, lighthearted show",
        "I came across a hilarious video on YouTube in which a cat (an imaginary, magical cat) was practicing speaking English, then, of course, YouTube kept recommending more videos from what I later found out was Azumanga Daio, then I realized the whole series was uploaded on YouTube and I check it out and ended up binging it.Right from the start, the show is insane in a very good and hilarious way. A teacher, Miss Yukari, is running late to school and one of her students sees her and offers help, what would a beautiful and young teacher do in a situation like this? You guessed wrong, she steals her students bike and rushes to school, leaving her student behind. I was immediately hooked. All characters are very endearing and cute, even the crazy teacher Yukari or I should say, especially the crazy teacher Yukari, who is one of my favorite characters along with Sakaki.The only bad thing is it's only 26 episodes...",
        "Azumanga Daioh (Hiroshi NISHIKIORI, 2002) (based on Kiyohiko AZUMA's comic strip of the same name)Take the fundamental sweetness of the best of the \"Peanuts\" TV specials, mix it with the whacked out humor of \"Calvin and Hobbes\", add in some stylistic homages to Isao Takahata's films (the memory scenes of \"Only Yesterday\" and his neglected 1999 masterpiece \"Our Neighbors the Yamadas\") -- and you have anything but a routine anime series. (It also reminds me a bit of the quirky short-lived TV series \"Square Pegs\" from many years ago). The show follows the lives of seven girls (including one 10 year old genius who skipped middle school) and three teachers (two highly dysfunctional, one _mostly_ sane) through all three years of high school (that's how the system works in Japan). This is mostly side-splittingly funny, though it managed to evoke a few furtive tears before it ended. The characters are everything in this virtually plotless traversal of three years of school (and vacations). Although this series runs for 26 episodes, it ends all too quickly -- I was far from weary of the charming and loveable characters portrayed here. (The best term to describve the show is, of course, Japanese -- \"kawai\" which means not only ultra-cute but very loveable). This show was immensely popular in Japan, and has recently been licensed for release in the USA (thank you ADV).",
        "This animation is based on a Japanese comic strip, kind of like Charles Schulz's \"Peanuts\" in North America. Like the \"Peanuts\" cartoon each episode is built on short segments taken from the comic strip. It has been shown at a few Toronto anime clubs and I also have seen it on DVD. It was jarring watching the show at first because the episodes are really just a series of short gags and then suddenly we see the next episode preview. We have some anime stereotypes like the loudmouth Tomo, the dimwitted Osaka and the pushy Yukari but some characters seemed fresh like Chiyo a bright ten-year old girl who was advanced all the way to high school. Since Japanese high school covers 15 to 17 year-olds Chiyo is much shorter and physically underdeveloped compared the rest of the class. This leads to recurring gags like when Chiyo acts like an elementary school student or when she can't keep up with the rest in phys ed class. If you search the Internet you should find a few translated comic strips so you can see if this series is right for you but I give it a \"thumbs-up\".",
        "to say the least, this is quite a crazy anime. It's difficult to describe the basis of the story but it simply follows the lives of a group of high-school girls and their teachers, each with different querks. although each episode is pretty much stand alone, the whole series follows the girls through their three years in high-school, from entrance to graduation. as long as you watch the first few episodes (which introduce the characters), you'll understand what's going on (the episodes really seem like the manga, which itself are a bunch of four panelled stories which stand alone well, but when put together make a great series). of course, nothing matches watching the full series. it might not have much action, but it's great fun and well animated, it's guaranteed to make you laugh and smile and it's just so adorable you'll feel a special bond with each character by the end. you'll find yourself drawn into the character's world and you'll be sad to say goodbye to them when the series ends.",
        "The conventions of anime (and there are many) become, over time (and that is 17 years in my case) rather tiresome. All the shows start to look the same and you become disillusioned.The sense that, something which could be \"great\" is being squandered, enters your mind and you start to tune out to new product. This is what happened to me at the start of 2002 when I saw the first production pics for the series Azumanga Daioh. \"Just another show about schoolgirls\", I thought. \"Seen a lot of those. Bleh....\" These thoughts persisted until I saw my first episode. Actually, it was episode 2, but it concentrated on a character who has haunted me ever since with her ever so cute, and occasionally scary, vacuous smile.... Kasuga Ayumu, aka \"Osaka\". The moment she failed to cross the pedestrian crossing in time because she was thinking too hard about it convinced me we were in the presence of _genius_. :) I gobbled up this show like no other, basking in the airheaded glory of Osaka, wishing a painful death upon Tomo (preferably at Yomi's hands), waiting for Kamineko to (inevitably) chomp Sakaki's fingers, nodding sagely at Yukari-sensei's contempt for her students, wondering (like Osaka) whether Chiyo-chan's ponytails were, in fact, distinct entities of their own and wincing at Kimura's one-way journey to an inevitable police raid. And then it finished.... leaving me feeling more empty than I have felt at the ending of any other TV show.Yes, I might not have much of a life.... But I defy anyone to watch the Hitchcockian moment in episode 22 where Osaka wakes Yukari-sensei.... with a knife.... and NOT fall in love with this show and its characters. ;) The animation work is surprisingly sparse and cheap (the budget for the show wasn't huge) but somehow this really doesn't seem to matter, as the show doesn't rely upon its spectacular visuals. Yet the show has a \"style\" that is quite original. A later series, \"Sensei no Ojikan -Doki Doki School Hours\", tried to emulate the style and look of Azumanga, and failed (rather spectacularly), which just goes to show that, no matter how simple or unplanned Azumanga appears, quite a lot of thought has gone into making it work.9.9/10.... As long as I can have an Iriomote Mountain Cat as a pet, too. :)",
        "This is one anime that would have you laughing and cheer you up after a hard, depressing day with lovable characters, funny dialogue, and so much you can get out of something that you normally don't expect.",
        "When I started watching anime I mostly only saw what was on Toonami or late night Adult Swim (which might tell you how old I am). But I learned that I could watch anime online and so I watched my first series that I found on my own... and it was School Days.It didn't get better because I watched Green Green and the incredibly boring Tokimeki Love Memorial. I probably should have given up on anime, but I then watched Azumanga Daioh which had just come to the US at the time (again, says how old I am).Azumanga Daioh was the first series I ever went out and bought. I still own the DVD box set. It's a slice of life genre (which also became a pet favorite of my) which means there is no real plot, just a group of girls going about their normal school lives. The only weird thing is Chiyo, a ten year old super genius who gets to go to high school (which is not actually allowed in Japan school system). We follow Chiyo, Tomo, Sakaki, Osaka, Yomi, Kagura, their teachers Yukari and Nyamo, and a few others throughout their three years in high school (Japan has three years of middle school and three of high school).I think what made this work for me was that I felt like I knew these people like the ADHD Tomo, the tomboyish Kagura, the spacey Osaka, and Yomi is basically me. And at ending (which is obviously their graduation) almost made me cry because it was like I was watching close friends eventually have to go their separate ways.This is a series I love to death and it makes me sad that it's starting to fade from the memories of otaku today. Even worse it was licensed by ADV who went bankrupt so DVDs are out of print. But if you can watch it, do it because it will brighten your day.",
        "Azumanga daioh is a lovely little show with alot of Charm and Charakter the Humor is consistent and Fun and nothing gets to anoying. The music in this Show is also very memeroable and fits really Well.If i had to citisize anything i would say that the only Male teacher is really anoying the Paicing can be all over the place and that Kaorin is really underused. But Overall its an enjoyable Show.One Thing tho If you hate the over the top Humor and Animationen Form the early 2000 you will not enjoy this.",
        "I seen a lot of animes with comedy: Sonic X, Naruto, Charomartie High and others but riveling them is 'Azumanga Daioh'. The tale of a few teenaged girls, Sasaki, Chiyo, Karion, Yomo, Tomo, Osaka and many others. Each girls has their own personalty and proves it by being wired, silly or even funny. Despite the original 15 minutes or whatever, in America its up to I believe 27 minutes. The anime dosn't know when to end comedy or put it on pause but no matter who sees it it may just crack them up.No matter if its going to be a field trip or average school day these girls will never end up silent.",
        "Now, this is what I've been waiting for! An anime series without spells, heartless villains and destroyed world. Not that I don't like these either but it was about time to watch a simple, beautiful and amazingly funny story like Azumanga Daioh. There is no plot in this show, instead we get to see the everyday life of six girls with different characters throughout their three high-school years. Sounds boring but believe me, it's not. It's so funny, it's so weird and surreal at times, it's possibly the funniest thing I've ever seen. The voice cast fits perfectly (I prefer the Japanese voices, they are so much cuter!) and it has one of the greatest music scores I 've heard. Really, the music is so unique and distinctive, cheerful harmonicas and flutes, setting a great mood. it's also very touching and sweet at certain episodes. From all the characters I would say Osaka is the best, she will make you laugh hard with her weird personality.I really hope more anime series like this will come in the near future.definitely 10/10",
        "I love anime. I love comedy. I love cute little girls in high schools (Which is clich\u00e9 and overused). Azumanga was one of the best high school comedy anime I have ever watched in my life!! The first minute into the first episode of the anime, I was already laughing like crazy!! Who would expect Yukari, a teacher, to (kind of) steal a bike from a student?? That first scene was just hilarious!!!! And then, I was officially hooked. The proceeding scenes were never dull and it got my stomach hurting and tears bursting out with laughter. It was late at night when I watched it on the internet, so my parents were quite annoyed, but maybe that's because I was yelling at the computer screen to \"Stop!! You're killing me!!!\".You have six (seven if you count Sakaki's fan, Kaorin) main characters, quite a lot of names to remember... They're Chiyo, Sakaki, Kagura, Osaka, Tomo, and Yomi. But their appearances are quite different from each other, and they're usually individually featured in scenes, and their personalities are quite memorable, so you wouldn't have any problems ^^ With the cast introduced, let me delve into the storyline. There is virtually no storyline and it almost felt as if each episode was done on the spot by its producers without any planning. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, it was still crazily funny!!!!!! Who cares about storyline when you're making a sitcom?!!!! Just watch this anime, you wouldn't regret it, I promise you the best moments of laughing from watching this unless you're a person without a sense of humor!!!",
        "I saw a trailer for Azumanga daioh and thought it was going to be childish nonsense. Admitedly the trailer only showed a modified version of the show's introduction sequence, rather than real footage from the show. Shame on the makers of the trailer, I say! Then I watched an episode of the show and was instantly hooked. This is probably one of the best comedy animes I've seen so far. While shows like Abenobashi or Excel Saga are funny in a zany way, Azumanga is funny in a more realistic way. As other reviewers have noted, there is no plot as such - it's more like a sitcom.The characters seem very likable and all have their own characteristics. Some of the teachers also feature, and I think this gives the show an interesting perspective as you see that they just as quirky as the kids. (OK, perhaps MORE quirky than some of the kids).One of the reasons this show has hooked me is that it is consistently funny. Some other shows I've seen have had a few episodes that were hilarious and a few that barely raised a smile. I think every episode of Azumanga has had me laughing out loud.If you haven't seen this show because the trailer put you off, don't panic! Yes, there's a certain amount of cuteness (especially Chiyo), but the show is a lot of fun. But the Muppets demonstrated that cuteness doesn't mean it's only for kids.Azumanga may not be suitable for young children because of some cuss words and slightly teenage/adult content (although children see that on TV before the watershed these days). Teenagers aren't likely to be too worried by any of that though.This 37-year-old male gives Azumanga daioh 5 stars out of 5!"

        "Tomoya Okazaki is a typical, if somewhat lazy high school student; then one day he meets Nagisa, a quiet girl who, due to an illness, is repeating her final year. She wants to restart the school's drama club and he agrees to help her. For much of the time this plot takes a back seat as the pair, along with other friends get involved in other plot arcs. The most notable being the first where they help Fuko, a first year girl, who wants to invite everybody to her sister's wedding. This may sound fairly routine but there is something odd about Fuko, first she is carving wooden starfish to give everybody and secondly not everybody seems to notice her\u0085 for reasons I won't spoil.In some ways this is a typical high school anime with its mix of varied characters and a blend of drama and comedy; there are however things that make it stand out. Protagonist Tomoya may have several female friends but it never becomes a harem series and the stories have a good emotional pull\u0085 especially when we learn certain things about Fuko. Amidst the drama there are some very funny moments; mostly involving Tomoya's friend Youhei. There are a good range of interesting characters; their designs are fairly standard but they are distinctive enough that one shouldn't confuse who is who. The story is well told although it must be noted that the twenty third episode is the real final episode; episode twenty four takes place in an alternate timeline where Tomoya is involved with the studious school council president\u0085 something others disapprove of. I can't say how it compares to 'After Story' but having read other reviews I think that is something I need to watch. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the genre.",
        "Very cute story about a Fed up high school student who falls in love with a lonely girl, it definately gives you a lot of emotions and it is nice to watch! 8/10 I give it!",
        "Japan's favourite slice of life series, Clannad rises and falls on its oversized heart and untainted emotional grace. Infused with bits of magic realism, the show is some kind of a daydream; a story where everyone wins and gets what they want at a cost of virtually nothing.the protagonist is Okazaki Tomoya. He is unmotivated and depressed, (although he never seems that way) but things get turned around after he makes friends at his new high school. How perfect is it that all the girls in the show are drawn to him. One girl however stands out. Nagisa is an angel face with a heart to match, the kind of girl that is too impossibly perfect. The fact that she seems small enough to be his little sister is somewhat distracting once it becomes obvious that they are heading towards being a couple. What is important however is that they get along perfectly, it is everything but a forced relationship. And yet Nagissa is strangely underwhelming as a character simply because she has no flaws. She is precious, and not much else.When it comes to art, few animated shows paint with sunlight as vividly as Clannad. This is a world where the sky is always blue in the day and golden in the evening. Even more extraordinary however is how the show has a way of summoning beauty out of the mundane; out of the flies hovering around a street lamp, or the quaint naturalism of the bakery that Nagissa's family owns, or in the elegant minimalism of a traditional Japanese bedroom. If you are anything but a 12 year old girl, comedy goes further than drama in this series. Sakagami has the same angel face as all the other girls but she can drop kick any of the boys in the school out a window. Ichinosuke's violin playing is a riot and Nagissa's mom who is unflinchingly over sensitive about her baking is adorable. But the problem with Clanaad is it has an ongoing feeling of sameness. Everybody is generous everyday 24/7. There is little in the way of depth or drama. The introverted Ichinosuke has a shadowy intriguing backstory that far surpasses what the show writes for everyone else. Individual scenes and sometimes even episodes play well on the grounds of charm, but the whole series tastes of too much sugar.",
        "With some 6,800+ \"ratings\" but only 17 reviews (most of them oh-so-glowing and in oddly-similar writing style)... one can't help but wonder if the rating system has been gamed here. Those kind of numbers just don't happen in normal IMDB reviews.I am not an adrenaline junkie. I didn't like Transformers, and don't require action/adventure in my anime. I can appreciate slow-moving, emotional story lines as well as cerebral work. I am not easy to bore.That said, by the end of the 3rd episode of Clannad I was bored to shutting it off. The extremely cliche 2-dimensional characters as well as a story line that makes you wonder if they're ever going to get to the main plot simply leaves the viewer cold. If they can't establish the main plot within three episodes, one has to wonder if it is any more than a one-joke story (arrogant guy keeps getting beat up by a girl).I wasn't willing to invest any more time in a \"wonder if it's going to get any better\" venture. Wasted too much time on such films that no... didn't get any better. I am highly suspect of the glowing 9 & 10-star reviews here... and that there are so very few (almost non-existant) negative reviews. Unless the story and characters made an almost miraculous improvement in episodes 4 and onward, this is a \"spend your time on better anime\" production.",
        "This was an anime series that I wasn't interested in at the time. At that point I wasn't into anime as a whole but around 2015 I decided to give anime more of a chance and I'm glad I did. I have seen about 15 different series and Am still looking for more good ones as well. This anime was a good start to the Clannad series even tho I do think it's not as epic or as emotional as After Story is. The comedy is funny, the characters are very good, the acting is good in Japanese (tho the dub is pretty good but Japanese audio for this anime is the way to go imo), and it's drama is sweet. It's a lot more light-hearted then After Story but it still contains very sad scenes in it. I would recommend this to any anime fan and even to those who are into Romance/Drama. The show isn't perfect tho, I feel as tho some episodes drag and at times the pacing can be slow. Still this anime is Worth watching.",
        "After watching Angel Beats, I didn't know if anything could top it. But I had heard of Clannad and already was hearing about how devastating it is and I finally decided to see it. Again, the music and the animation was good, especially for the intro. Except, I had a hard time getting used to how their eyes all looked. I found it actually creepy. My other problem with Clannad was it has a very slow beginning but thankfully picks up the pace. I was also so used to the female characters in Angel Beats being really strong that I wasn't used to seeing Nagisa always crying but that only lasted for at least half the show (when counting After Story as well). Aside from that, the show was alright. It's Clannad After Story that's where I find the story really begins. The stories though of the other characters Tomoya helps out are really well done like Fuko's and Nagisa's and Kotomi's and it's a very happy ending by the last episode for everyone. Until Clannad After Story.",
        "Clannad on its own is a fun if unremarkable anime. Due to it being adapted from a visual novel, it plays of like a game with each girl getting their own arc while the main female character Nagisa's story is side stepped only being fulfilled late in the story. It has its funny moments and some touching or sad moments. Clannad is set in high school like many other anime. It has a conventional albeit quite satisfying and touching ending after which we get the masterful continuation that is Clannad: After Story which is unlike any other anime. Ultimately Clannad does a decent job of letting you know and care for the main two characters Tomoya and Nagisa and setting up the world before you enter the emotionally turbulent and rewarding experience that is After Story.While Clannad on itself is a decent experience, its the combination of Clannad + After Story makes for a riveting roller coaster of varying emotions.",
        "I was hooked at episode one I needed like all of that in my life this show is indescribable it is honestly incredible \u2764\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe",
        "It's been months since I finished Clannad and it's a show that has helped me to see life differently and see people different. It's absolutely worth your time.",
        "9/10 A story of the hardships of a young man and his experience in romance. This was an anime that was cute and funny at times and heart wrenching and wholesome at other. Overall the series was a good watch and had a happy ending.",
        "Note that anything I say only goes for the dubbed version: No major spoilersStory - Clannad follows Tomoya Okazaki a fairly average student who has a tendency to skip lessons a lot. One day on his way to school he meets a strange girl (Nagisa) saying strange things, he decides to walk to school with her. After a few meetings he learns she wants to revive the drama club so Tomoya decides to help her with the help from a large cast of other strange friends.Story Review - I went into not expecting much as Clannad isn't a series that I'd really watch but a lot of people liked it so I thought I'd check it out. I thought the story of the drama club was OK nothing bad about it but Clannad isn't a story heavy show it's a character heavy show. The backstories of all the major characters are the focus here and they are all varied and interesting and very well toldMain Characters - The characters are fantastic in this series. Personally I like it because it tries to avoid fanservice although it does creep up from time to time. Tomoya is a well thought out character not as boring as he first seems. Nagisa is a sweet and lovely character who is hard to fault and has great character development. Tsunahara, Tomoya's best friend is the comedy relief of the series and is always funny to watch. Fuko Ibuki has a very large story arch, which I found to be quite sad really although the character is also very funny. Kitomi Inchinose has a fairly large story arch too in which you find she knew Tomoya long ago and also has a sad backstory and I loved her character as she is completely bonkers. I also liked Nagisa's parents Akio and Tsunai they were so funny. The other characters I don't judge to be that important, so much so they got their own OVA's in an alternate reality. They aren't bad or anything I just don't think they were major enough.Animation - Right off the bat you see that this series looks phenomenal. Key did a great job here. I really liked the look of the girl and the robot scenes as the animation looked so fluid and real. Music - Clannad has one of my favourite OST'so good I rank it up with Joe Hisaishi's Ghibli films. It does re-use tracks a lot but they are all placed perfectly that it didn't bother me. The intro theme is very good and I like the Big Dango family song as it fits the series perfectly.Drawbacks - The only drawback I felt didn't bother me but it may bother other viewers. It can get very confusing. You will not understand the girl and the robot scene and if you think you do you are wrong I guarantee it. That's not to insult your intelligence at all it's just it is explained in the second series. Also I didn't like the idea for naming Tomoyo (Who is one of the girls I didn't mention) as it gets really confusing with the main guy Tomoya.Overall - Clannad easily deserves all it's praise and is a must see. The music and animation are great and the characters are all likable. I must say though if you watch this series and at the end wasn't impressed or thought it was lacking or feel that way mid-series push through to the end because the second series is a vast improvement in every way and I mean vast not a little bit.9.3/10",
        "The first season is just horrible. Nothing happens of any interest. It is not funny, it is not mysterious, it is not romantic, it has no plot, the characters are unremarkable. Slice of life typically has some other element beyond just pointless rambling dialogue or at the very least has good character building. This has nothing. After 24 episodes, I am left wondering how anyone could say this is a good anime. I saw it on many lists that it was a good story and on many lists of it being a good love story. This is none of that. It reminds me of doing nothing and convincing myself that I had a great time doing absolutely nothing.I started on season 2 (after story) and it too is just a rambling unremarkable mess. I have read that around episode 18 of after story there is some incredibly emotional part to this story, but how? To evoke emotion, care has to be given to the characters and this series completely fails in that. I tried but there is no way I can sit through another 13 episodes just to get to the likely misguidedly labeled good episode near the end.",
        "If you seen my reviews around you would know that a 6 in my opinion, is average. As a Clannad fangirl/fanboy reading that I called it average, you're probably flipping a table. But hear me out, I have good things to say. Many but also bad things, so stay beside me fangirl/fanboy we'll get through this. First of all, love the main character. Absolutely great character, my favorite shojo main character. It's not because his backstory really hits home to me, because I went through a similar situation but he's cheeky and the total antihero but has a warm heart. Very likable, actually very is a understatement, EXTREMELY likable. However, the other characters not so much. His partner in crime is annoying and same goes with other characters. The writing is alright, nothing too special. It's really just another slice of life which a few sad backstories and great main character. Dunno what else to rave about really, it's average. Not everyone loves but not everyone hates it, so I do recommend it. But it you're excepting a life changing anime. Doesn't do too much of that, but it's sequel kind of does :)",
        "The series is good. After watching it all, what I really truly like about the series is the family of Akio, Sanae & Nagisa, and episode 24! \u2665 If u r looking to watch something in this genre i.e. Slice of Life, Romance. This is a MUST WATCH!It shows how the things that matter the most in life are FAMILY And Dreams. With, the right answer being, like the most things in life, somewhere in betwn those 2. After, Marriage It's not like ur everyday is going to be all exciting or anything, nd it's not just Romance nd all. But, what really matters is the small things u do for each other making the life of each other happy nd colourful.{ From the family of Akio, Sanae nd Nagisa, nd ep 24.}\nDon't Worry, That's all for the philosophy part. BTW, this review is only for CLANNAD. M eagerly about to watch \"The after story\" probably after some break.\nThank U!",
        "Clannad is my favorite anime of all time. It has breathing taking visuals, wonderful characters with GREAT development, and a slow yet beautiful story. Those who don't watch the entire anime are quick to judge Clannad as \"just another harem anime\", but if you take the time to watch, and appreciate the shows messages, you will realize that it is SO much more than your average harem anime. Very funny and a feel-good show!",
        "After I finished watching the first episode,I was shocked.It's not a tradional anime but a story about life.The anime not only trys to show us Okazaki's adolescense,but also teach us the truth about love and friendship.We can even call the anime \"Life\".",
        "This series and After Story, completely destroyed my emotions. I've become a complete wreck! Just hearing the dango song makes me start crying (almost hysterically)\nNothing I've ever seen in my life has come close to how this affected me!\nSo perfect, so sublime, so haunting\nIt's a masterpiece in every sense of the word",
        "Alternative episode was the only one good thing in this anime. IMO it's better than whole story.",
        "I had high expectations for this anime after watching tora dora since this one left a deeply sad-yet-satisfying feeling on me. In the end I'll just say I enjoyed watching it, but I didn't felt any rush to watch after story and just felt an\"ok\" emotion after last episode (actually, I enjoyed a lot more the bonus episodes of tomoyo and Kyou)The reason? I can't agree with a character who supposedly helps others and seem to be kind, but (imho) the girl she decides to love is based on a selfishness (prob I think this because i'm psychologist, but he basically picks her to fill his gaps). Don't get me wrong, it's natural for people being selfish and and make decisions based only on their needs, however, that's not being mature and far from truly love another person.",
        "I honestly don't understand this anime. The anime wasn't bad, there was a lot of great characters and the comedy was great but I just don't get the hype.The first episodes of this anime were very boring and the whole time all I cared about was the Fuko girl and the robot thingy. I had so many questions unanswered about them and when I finished Clannad I thought I would get an answer but I just didn't. Is Fuko a ghost? Is Fuko Alive? Was Fuko going through the different worlds? Did Fuko get out of her coma? Who is the robot? Who is the girl with the robot? Why are they in the show?I DONT GET IT!! The whole show is just about romance and comedy so why did the writers try to add this other world when they never explained anything??? Did I miss an episode? Do they explain it in Clannad After story? I'm so confused. I literally only watched the show for the other world plot story and I still don't understand the other world thing.",
        "Best series just a combination of romance ,emotion,comedy ,high school love for kids ,just amazing in all aspect",
        "Good watch on slower side. Lot to learn.\nI like Tokoyo and if everyone can be Tomoyo that will be great.\nHope I find a friend like Tomoyo.",
        "Dont watch this instead read its summary and watch S2 direct. S1 is just time wasting. Wasted my 30 mins. and i am regreting till date",
        "This masterpiece forever carved its way through the core of my heart. And it changed me forever. I decided to rewatch it from the beginning this May of 2021 and i never regretted it. They still grown to me. My life never been better \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude0d",
        "The paising is perfect for the storyline, the soundtrack and the character development. I would also state that I don't think the main characters are shallow.\nThe secondary character are not shallow just don't have as much character development. I truly believe that enhances the bond between the main characters.\nI think it's the best anime for its category in I'll highly recommend it.The opening theme song is also amazing"
